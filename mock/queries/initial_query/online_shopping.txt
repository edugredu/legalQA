I bought a new pair of shoes from an online store a few weeks ago. 
The website looked trustworthy, and I paid with my credit card. 
The order confirmation email said the package would arrive in 5 days, but it’s now been over two weeks and I still haven’t received anything. 
I’ve tried contacting the seller several times through email and their online chat, but they haven’t replied at all. 
I’m starting to worry that I’ve lost my money. 
I don’t really know what my rights are as a customer in this situation, or what steps I should take next. 
Is there anything I can do to get my money back or to make the seller respond? 
Should I contact my bank or is there some official place I can complain to? 
I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do when an online order doesn’t arrive and the seller ignores you.
