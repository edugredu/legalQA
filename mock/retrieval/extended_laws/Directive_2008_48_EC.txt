DIRECTIVES

DIRECTIVE 2008/48/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 23 April 2008
on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION,

in the field of credit for natural persons in general and
consumer credit in particular. An analysis of the national
laws transposing Directive 87/102/EEC shows that Member
States use a variety of consumer protection mechanisms, in
addition to Directive 87/102/EEC, on account of differences
in the legal or economic situation at national level.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,

(4)

The de facto and de jure situation resulting from those
national differences in some cases leads to distortions of
competition among creditors in the Community and
creates obstacles to the internal market where Member
States have adopted different mandatory provisions more
stringent than those provided for in Directive 87/102/EEC.
It restricts consumers' ability to make direct use of the
gradually increasing availability of cross-border credit.
Those distortions and restrictions may in turn have
consequences in terms of the demand for goods and
services.

(5)

In recent years the types of credit offered to and used by
consumers have evolved considerably. New credit instruments have appeared, and their use continues to develop. It
is therefore necessary to amend existing provisions and to
extend their scope, where appropriate.

(6)

In accordance with the Treaty, the internal market
comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the
free movement of goods and services and freedom of
establishment are ensured. The development of a more
transparent and efficient credit market within the area
without internal frontiers is vital in order to promote the
development of cross-border activities.

(7)

In order to facilitate the emergence of a well-functioning
internal market in consumer credit, it is necessary to make
provision for a harmonised Community framework in a
number of core areas. In view of the continuously
developing market in consumer credit and the increasing
mobility of European citizens, forward-looking Community
legislation which is able to adapt to future forms of credit
and which allows Member States the appropriate degree of
flexibility in their implementation should help to establish a
modern body of law on consumer credit.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and
Social Committee (1),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251
of the Treaty (2),

Whereas:

(1)

Council Directive 87/102/EEC of 22 December 1986 for
the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning
consumer credit (3) lays down rules at Community level
concerning consumer credit agreements.

(2)

In 1995, the Commission presented a report on the
operation of Directive 87/102/EEC and undertook a broad
consultation of the interested parties. In 1997, the
Commission presented a summary report of reactions to
the 1995 report. A second report was produced in 1996
on the operation of Directive 87/102/EEC.

(3)

Those reports and consultations revealed substantial
differences between the laws of the various Member States

It is important that the market should offer a sufficient
degree of consumer protection to ensure consumer
confidence. Thus, it should be possible for the free
movement of credit offers to take place under optimum
conditions for both those who offer credit and those who
require it, with due regard to specific situations in the
individual Member States.

Full harmonisation is necessary in order to ensure that all
consumers in the Community enjoy a high and equivalent
level of protection of their interests and to create a genuine
internal market. Member States should therefore not be
allowed to maintain or introduce national provisions other
than those laid down in this Directive. However, such
restriction should only apply where there are provisions
harmonised in this Directive. Where no such harmonised
provisions exist, Member States should remain free to
maintain or introduce national legislation. Accordingly,
Member States may, for instance, maintain or introduce
national provisions on joint and several liability of the seller
or the service provider and the creditor. Another example
of this possibility for Member States could be the
maintenance or introduction of national provisions on
the cancellation of a contract for the sale of goods or supply
of services if the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal
from the credit agreement. In this respect Member States, in
the case of open-end credit agreements, should be allowed
to fix a minimum period needing to elapse between the
time when the creditor asks for reimbursement and the day
on which the credit has to be reimbursed.

L 133/67

(12) Agreements for the provision on a continuing basis of

services or for the supply of goods of the same kind, where
the consumer pays for them for the duration of their
provision by means of instalments, may differ considerably,
in terms of the interests of the contractual parties involved,
and the modalities and performance of the transactions,
from credit agreements covered by this Directive. Therefore,
it should be clarified that such agreements are not regarded
as credit agreements for the purposes of this Directive. Such
types of agreement include, for example, an insurance
contract where the insurance is paid for in monthly
instalments.

(13) This Directive should not apply to certain types of credit

agreement, such as deferred debit cards, under the terms of
which the credit has to be repaid within three months and
only insignificant charges are payable.

(14) Credit agreements covering the granting of credit secured

by real estate should be excluded from the scope of this
Directive. That type of credit is of a very specific nature.
Also, credit agreements the purpose of which is to finance
the acquisition or retention of property rights in land or in
an existing or projected building should be excluded from
the scope of this Directive. However, credit agreements
should not be excluded from the scope of this Directive
only because their purpose is the renovation or increase of
value of an existing building.

(10) The definitions contained in this Directive determine the

scope of harmonisation. The obligation on Member States
to implement the provisions of this Directive should
therefore be limited to its scope as determined by those
definitions. However, this Directive should be without
prejudice to the application by Member States, in
accordance with Community law, of the provisions of this
Directive to areas not covered by its scope. A Member State
could thereby maintain or introduce national legislation
corresponding to the provisions of this Directive or certain
of its provisions on credit agreements outside the scope of
this Directive, for instance on credit agreements involving
amounts less than EUR 200 or more than EUR 75 000.
Furthermore, Member States could also apply the provisions of this Directive to linked credit which does not fall
within the definition of a linked credit agreement as
contained in this Directive. Thus, the provisions on linked
credit agreements could be applied to credit agreements
that serve only partially to finance a contract for the supply
of goods or provision of a service.

(15) The provisions of this Directive apply irrespective of

whether the creditor is a legal person or a natural person.
However, this Directive does not affect the right of Member
States to limit, in conformity with Community law, the
provision of credit for consumers to legal persons only or
to certain legal persons.

(16) Certain provisions of this Directive should apply to natural

and legal persons (credit intermediaries) who, in the course
of their trade, business or profession, for a fee, present or
offer credit agreements to consumers, assist consumers by
undertaking preparatory work in respect of credit agreements or conclude credit agreements with consumers on
behalf of the creditor. Organisations which allow their
identity to be used in promoting credit products, such as
credit cards, and which may also recommend those
products to their members should not be regarded as
credit intermediaries for the purposes of this Directive.

(11) In the case of specific credit agreements to which only some

provisions of this Directive are applicable, Member States
should not be allowed to adopt national legislation
implementing other provisions of this Directive. However,
Member States should remain free to regulate, in their
national legislation, such types of credit agreements as
regards other aspects not harmonised by this Directive.

(17) This Directive regulates only certain obligations of credit

intermediaries in relation to consumers. Member States
should therefore remain free to maintain or introduce

L 133/68

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

additional obligations incumbent on credit intermediaries,
including the conditions under which a credit intermediary
may receive fees from a consumer who has requested his
service.

22.5.2008

referred to in the credit agreement should not be regarded
as credit agreements with a fixed borrowing rate.

(22) Member States should remain free to maintain or introduce
(18) Consumers should be protected against unfair or mislead-

ing practices, in particular with respect to the disclosure of
information by the creditor, in line with Directive 2005/29/
EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of
11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer
commercial practices in the internal market (‘Unfair
Commercial Practices Directive) (1). However, this Directive
should contain specific provisions on advertising concerning credit agreements as well as certain items of standard
information to be provided to consumers in order to enable
them, in particular, to compare different offers. Such
information should be given in a clear, concise and
prominent way by means of a representative example. A
ceiling should be provided where it is not possible to
indicate the total amount of credit as the total sums made
available, in particular where a credit agreement gives the
consumer freedom of drawdown with a limitation with
regard to the amount. The ceiling should indicate the upper
limit of credit which can be made available to the
consumer. In addition, Member States should remain free
to regulate information requirements in their national law
regarding advertising which does not contain information
on the cost of the credit.
(19) In order to enable consumers to make their decisions in full

knowledge of the facts, they should receive adequate
information, which the consumer may take away and
consider, prior to the conclusion of the credit agreement,
on the conditions and cost of the credit and on their
obligations. To ensure the fullest possible transparency and
comparability of offers, such information should, in
particular, include the annual percentage rate of charge
applicable to the credit, determined in the same way
throughout the Community. As the annual percentage rate
of charge can at this stage be indicated only through an
example, such example should be representative. Therefore,
it should correspond, for instance, to the average duration
and total amount of credit granted for the type of credit
agreement under consideration and, if applicable, to the
goods purchased. When determining the representative
example, the frequency of certain types of credit agreement
in a specific market should also be taken into account. As
regards the borrowing rate, the frequency of instalments
and the capitalisation of interest, creditors should use their
conventional method of calculation for the consumer credit
concerned.
(20) The total cost of the credit to the consumer should

comprise all the costs, including interest, commissions,
taxes, fees for credit intermediaries and any other fees
which the consumer has to pay in connection with the
credit agreement, except for notarial costs. Creditors’ actual
knowledge of the costs should be assessed objectively,
taking into account the requirements of professional
diligence.

national provisions prohibiting the creditor from requiring
the consumer, in connection with the credit agreement, to
open a bank account or conclude an agreement in respect
of another ancillary service, or to pay the expenses or fees
for such bank accounts or other ancillary services. In those
Member States where such combined offers are allowed,
consumers should be informed before the conclusion of the
credit agreement about any ancillary services which are
compulsory in order for the credit to be obtained in the
first place or on the terms and conditions marketed. The
costs payable in respect of those ancillary services should be
included in the total cost of the credit; alternatively, if the
amount of such costs cannot be determined in advance,
consumers should receive adequate information about the
existence of costs at a pre-contractual stage. The creditor
must be presumed to have knowledge of the costs of the
ancillary services which he offers to the consumer himself,
or on behalf of a third party, unless the price thereof
depends on the specific characteristics or situation of the
consumer.

(23) For specific types of credit agreements, however, it is

appropriate, in order to ensure an adequate level of
consumer protection without placing an excessive burden
on creditors or, where applicable, credit intermediaries, to
restrict the pre-contractual information requirements of
this Directive, taking into account the specific character of
such types of agreements.

(24) The consumer needs to be given comprehensive informa-

tion before he concludes the credit agreement, regardless of
whether or not a credit intermediary is involved in the
marketing of the credit. Therefore, in general, the precontractual information requirements should also apply to
credit intermediaries. However, where suppliers of goods
and services act as credit intermediaries in an ancillary
capacity, it is not appropriate to burden them with the legal
obligation to provide the pre-contractual information in
accordance with this Directive. Suppliers of goods and
services may be deemed, for example, to be acting as credit
intermediaries in an ancillary capacity if their activity as
credit intermediaries is not the main purpose of their trade,
business or profession. In those cases, a sufficient level of
consumer protection is still achieved since the creditor is
responsible for ensuring that the consumer receives the full
pre-contractual information, either from the intermediary,
if the creditor and the intermediary so agree, or in some
other appropriate manner.

(25) The potentially binding character of the information to be

provided to the consumer prior to the conclusion of the
credit agreement and the period of time during which the
creditor is to be bound by it may be regulated by the
Member States.

(21) Credit agreements in which a borrowing rate is periodically

revised in line with changes occurring in a reference rate

promote responsible practices during all phases of the

22.5.2008

credit relationship, taking into account the specific features
of their credit market. Those measures may include, for
instance, the provision of information to, and the education
of, consumers, including warnings about the risks attaching
to default on payment and to over-indebtedness. In the
expanding credit market, in particular, it is important that
creditors should not engage in irresponsible lending or give
out credit without prior assessment of creditworthiness,
and the Member States should carry out the necessary
supervision to avoid such behaviour and should determine
the necessary means to sanction creditors in the event of
their doing so. Without prejudice to the credit risk
provisions of Directive 2006/48/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating
to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit
institutions (1), creditors should bear the responsibility of
checking individually the creditworthiness of the consumer.
To that end, they should be allowed to use information
provided by the consumer not only during the preparation
of the credit agreement in question, but also during a longstanding commercial relationship. The Member States'
authorities could also give appropriate instructions and
guidelines to creditors. Consumers should also act with
prudence and respect their contractual obligations.

L 133/69

the database consulted. However, the creditor should not be
obliged to give such information when this is prohibited by
other Community legislation, for example legislation on
money laundering or the financing of terrorism. Furthermore, such information should not be given if this would
be contrary to objectives of public policy or public security,
such as the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences.

(30) This Directive does not regulate contract law issues related

to the validity of credit agreements. Therefore, in that area,
the Member States may maintain or introduce national
provisions which are in conformity with Community law.
Member States may regulate the legal regime governing the
offer to conclude the credit agreement, in particular when it
is to be given and the period during which it is to be
binding on the creditor. If such an offer is made at the same
time as the pre-contractual information provided for by this
Directive is given, it should, like any additional information
the creditor may wish to give to the consumer, be provided
in a separate document which may be annexed to the
Standard European Consumer Credit Information.

(27) Despite the pre-contractual information to be provided, the

consumer may still need additional assistance in order to
decide which credit agreement, within the range of
products proposed, is the most appropriate for his needs
and financial situation. Therefore, Member States should
ensure that creditors provide such assistance in relation to
the credit products which they offer to the consumer.
Where appropriate, the relevant pre-contractual information, as well as the essential characteristics of the products
proposed, should be explained to the consumer in a
personalised manner so that the consumer can understand
the effects which they may have on his economic situation.
Where applicable, this duty to assist the consumer should
also apply to credit intermediaries. Member States could
determine when and to what extent such explanations are
to be given to the consumer, taking into account the
particular circumstances in which the credit is offered, the
consumer's need for assistance and the nature of individual
credit products.

(28) To assess the credit status of a consumer, the creditor

should also consult relevant databases; the legal and actual
circumstances may require that such consultations vary in
scope. To prevent any distortion of competition among
creditors, it should be ensured that creditors have access to
private or public databases concerning consumers in a
Member State where they are not established under nondiscriminatory conditions compared with creditors in that
Member State.

(29) Where a decision to reject an application for credit is based

on the consultation of a database, the creditor should
inform the consumer of this fact and of the particulars of
(1) OJ L 177, 30.6.2006, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Directive
2008/24/EC (OJ L 81, 20.3.2008, p. 38).

(31) In order to enable the consumer to know his rights and

obligations under the credit agreement, it should contain all
necessary information in a clear and concise manner.

(32) In order to ensure full transparency, the consumer should

be provided with information concerning the borrowing
rate, both at a pre-contractual stage and when the credit
agreement is concluded. During the contractual relationship, the consumer should further be informed of changes
to the variable borrowing rate and changes to the payments
caused thereby. This is without prejudice to provisions of
national law not related to consumer information which lay
down conditions for, or prescribe the consequences of,
changes, other than changes concerning payments, in
borrowing rates and other economic conditions governing
the credit, for instance rules providing that the creditor may
change the borrowing rate only where there is a valid
reason for such change or that the consumer may terminate
the contract should there be a change in the borrowing rate
or in some other economic condition concerning the credit.

(33) The contracting parties should have the right to effect a

standard termination of an open-end credit agreement. In
addition, if agreed in the credit agreement, the creditor
should have the right to suspend the consumer's right to
draw down on an open-end credit agreement for objectively
justified reasons. Such reasons may include, for instance,
suspicion of an unauthorised or fraudulent use of the credit
or a significantly increased risk of the consumer being
unable to fulfil his obligation to repay the credit. This
Directive does not affect national law in the area of contract
law regulating the rights of the contracting parties to
terminate the credit agreement on the basis of a breach of
contract.

L 133/70

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

(34) In order to approximate the procedures for exercising the

right of withdrawal in similar areas, it is necessary to make
provision for a right of withdrawal without penalty and
with no obligation to provide justification, under conditions similar to those provided for by Directive 2002/65/EC
of the European Parliament and of the Council of
23 September 2002 concerning the distance marketing of
consumer financial services (1).
(35) Where a consumer withdraws from a credit agreement in

connection with which he has received goods, in particular
from a purchase in instalments or from a hiring or leasing
agreement providing for an obligation to purchase, this
Directive should be without prejudice to any regulation by
Member States of questions concerning the return of the
goods or any related questions.
(36) In some cases, national legislation already provides that

funds cannot be made available to the consumer before the
expiry of a specific deadline. In these cases, consumers may
wish to ensure that they receive the goods or services
purchased early. Therefore, in the case of linked credit
agreements, Member States may exceptionally provide that,
if the consumer explicitly wishes early receipt, the deadline
for the exercise of the right of withdrawal could be reduced
to the same deadline before which funds cannot be made
available.
(37) In the case of linked credit agreements, a relationship of

interdependence exists between the purchase of goods or
services and the credit agreement concluded for that
purpose. Therefore, where the consumer exercises his right
of withdrawal in respect of the purchase agreement, based
on Community law, he should no longer be bound by the
linked credit agreement. This should not affect national law
applicable to linked credit agreements in cases where a
purchase agreement has been voided or where the
consumer has exercised his right of withdrawal based on
national law. Nor should this affect the rights of consumers
granted by national provisions according to which no
commitment may be entered into between the consumer
and a supplier of goods or services, nor any payment made
between those persons, as long as the consumer has not
signed the credit agreement to finance the purchase of the
goods or services.
(38) Under certain conditions, the consumer should be allowed

to pursue remedies against the creditor in the event of
problems related to the purchase agreement. However,
Member States should determine to what extent and under
what conditions the consumer is required to pursue his
remedies against the supplier, in particular by bringing an
action against the latter, before being in a position to pursue
them against the creditor. This Directive should not deprive
consumers of their rights under national provisions
attaching joint and several liability to the seller or supplier
of services and to the creditor.
(39) The consumer should have the right to discharge his

obligations before the date agreed in the credit agreement.
(1) OJ L 271, 9.10.2002, p. 16. Directive as last amended by Directive
2007/64/EC (OJ L 319, 5.12.2007, p. 1).

22.5.2008

In the case of early repayment, either in part or in full, the
creditor should be entitled to compensation for the costs
directly linked to the early repayment, taking into account
also any savings thereby made by the creditor. However, in
order to determine the method of calculating the
compensation, it is important to respect several principles.
The calculation of the compensation due to the creditor
should be transparent and comprehensible to consumers
already at the pre-contractual stage and in any case during
the performance of the credit agreement. In addition, the
calculation method should be easy for creditors to apply,
and supervisory control of the compensation by the
responsible authorities should be facilitated. Therefore,
and due to the fact that consumer credit is, given its
duration and volume, not financed by long-term funding
mechanisms, the ceiling for the compensation should be
fixed in terms of a flat-rate amount. This approach reflects
the special nature of credits for consumers and should not
prejudice the possibly different approach in respect of other
products which are financed by long-term funding
mechanisms, such as fixed-rate mortgage loans.

(40) Member States should have the right to provide that

compensation for early repayment may be claimed by the
creditor only on condition that the amount repaid over a
12-month period exceeds a threshold defined by Member
States. When fixing that threshold, which should not exceed
EUR 10 000, Member States should for instance take into
account the average amount of consumer credits in their
market.

(41) Assignment of the creditor's rights under a credit

agreement should not have the effect of placing the
consumer in a less favourable position. The consumer
should also be properly informed when the credit
agreement is assigned to a third party. However, where
the initial creditor, in agreement with the assignee,
continues to service the credit vis-à-vis the consumer, the
consumer has no significant interest in being informed of
the assignment. Therefore, a requirement at EU level that
the consumer be informed of the assignment in such cases
would be excessive.

(42) Member States should remain free to maintain or introduce

national rules providing for collective forms of communication when this is necessary for purposes relating to the
effectiveness of complex transactions such as securitisations
or liquidation of assets that take place in the compulsory
administrative liquidation of banks.

(43) In order to promote the establishment and functioning of

the internal market and to ensure a high degree of
protection for consumers throughout the Community, it is
necessary to ensure the comparability of information
relating to annual percentage rates of charge throughout
the Community. Despite the uniform mathematical formula
for its calculation, the annual percentage rate of charge
provided for in Directive 87/102/EEC is not yet fully

22.5.2008

Official Journal of the European Union

EN

comparable throughout the Community. In individual
Member States different cost factors are taken into account
in the calculation thereof. This Directive should therefore
clearly and comprehensively define the total cost of a credit
to the consumer.
(44) In order to ensure market transparency and stability, and

(51) Accordingly, taking account of the number of amendments

that need to be made to Directive 87/102/EEC due to the
evolution of the consumer credit sector and in the interests
of the clarity of Community legislation, that Directive
should be repealed and replaced by this Directive,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

pending further harmonisation, Member States should
ensure that appropriate measures for the regulation or
supervision of creditors are in place.

CHAPTER I
SUBJECT MATTER, SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS

(45) This Directive respects fundamental rights and observes the

principles recognised in particular by the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular,
this Directive seeks to ensure full respect for the rules on
protection of personal data, the right to property, nondiscrimination, protection of family and professional life,
and consumer protection pursuant to the Charter of
Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(46) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the establish-

ment of common rules for certain aspects of the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member
States concerning consumer credit, cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better
achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt
measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity
as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the
principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this
Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to
achieve that objective.
(47) Member States should lay down rules on penalties

applicable to infringements of the national provisions
adopted pursuant to this Directive and ensure that they are
implemented. While the choice of penalties remains within
the discretion of the Member States, the penalties provided
for should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

Article 1
Subject matter
The purpose of this Directive is to harmonise certain aspects of
the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the
Member States concerning agreements covering credit for
consumers.

Article 2
Scope
1. This Directive shall apply to credit agreements.
2. This Directive shall not apply to the following:
(a)

credit agreements which are secured either by a mortgage
or by another comparable security commonly used in a
Member State on immovable property or secured by a right
related to immovable property;

(b)

credit agreements the purpose of which is to acquire or
retain property rights in land or in an existing or projected
building;

(c)

credit agreements involving a total amount of credit less
than EUR 200 or more than EUR 75 000;

(d)

hiring or leasing agreements where an obligation to
purchase the object of the agreement is not laid down
either by the agreement itself or by any separate agreement;
such an obligation shall be deemed to exist if it is so
decided unilaterally by the creditor;

(e)

credit agreements in the form of an overdraft facility and
where the credit has to be repaid within one month;

(f)

credit agreements where the credit is granted free of interest
and without any other charges and credit agreements under
the terms of which the credit has to be repaid within three
months and only insignificant charges are payable;

(g)

credit agreements where the credit is granted by an
employer to his employees as a secondary activity free of
interest or at annual percentage rates of charge lower than
those prevailing on the market and which are not offered to
the public generally;

(48) The measures necessary for the implementation of this

Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council
Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the
procedures for the exercise of implementing powers
conferred on the Commission (1).
(49) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to

adopt additional assumptions for the calculation of the
annual percentage rate of charge. Since those measures are
of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential
elements of this Directive, they must be adopted in
accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny
provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(50) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional

law-making (2),

Agreement on better
Member States are
encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests
of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as
possible, the correlation between this Directive and the
transposition measures, and to make them public.

the information referred to in paragraph 1 is to be given to the
consumer periodically in cases where the change in the
borrowing rate is caused by a change in a reference rate, the
new reference rate is made publicly available by appropriate
means and the information concerning the new reference rate is
also kept available in the premises of the creditor.

5. In the case of credit agreements in the form of overdraft
facilities as referred to in Article 2(3), the following shall be
specified in a clear and concise manner:
Article 12
(a)

the type of credit;

(b)

the identities and geographical addresses of the contracting
parties as well as, if applicable, the identity and
geographical address of the credit intermediary involved;

Obligations in connection with credit agreement in the
form of an overdraft facility
1. Where a credit agreement covers credit in the form of an
overdraft facility, the consumer shall be kept regularly informed

L 133/79
Article 14

by means of a statement of account, on paper or on another
durable medium, containing the following particulars:

Right of withdrawal

(a)

the precise period to which the statement of account relates;

(b)

the amounts and dates of drawdowns;

1. The consumer shall have a period of 14 calendar days in
which to withdraw from the credit agreement without giving any
reason.

(c)

the balance from the previous statement, and the date
thereof;

That period of withdrawal shall begin

(d)

the new balance;

(e)

the dates and amounts of payments made by the consumer;

(f)

the borrowing rate applied;

(g)

any charges that have been applied;

(h)

where applicable, the minimum amount to be paid.

2. In addition, the consumer shall be informed on paper or
another durable medium of increases in the borrowing rate, or in
any charges payable, before the change in question enters into
force.
However, the parties may agree in the credit agreement that
information concerning changes in the borrowing rate is to be
given in the manner provided for in paragraph 1 in cases where
the change in the borrowing rate is caused by a change in a
reference rate, the new reference rate is made publicly available
by appropriate means and the information concerning the new
reference rate is also kept available in the premises of the
creditor.

(a)

either from the day of the conclusion of the credit
agreement, or

(b)

from the day on which the consumer receives the
contractual terms and conditions and information in
accordance with Article 10, if that day is later than the
date referred to in point (a) of this subparagraph.

2. Where in the case of a linked credit agreement, as defined in
Article 3(n), national legislation at the time of the entry into
force of this Directive already provides that funds cannot be
made available to the consumer before the expiry of a specific
period, Member States may exceptionally provide that the period
referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article may be reduced to this
specific period at the explicit request of the consumer.

3. If the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal, he shall:

(a)

in order to give effect to the withdrawal before the expiry of
the deadline referred to in paragraph 1, notify this to the
creditor in line with the information given by the creditor
pursuant to Article 10(2)(p) by means which can be proven
in accordance with national law. The deadline shall be
deemed to have been met if that notification, if it is on
paper or on another durable medium that is available and
accessible to the creditor, is dispatched before the deadline
expires; and

(b)

pay to the creditor the capital and the interest accrued
thereon from the date the credit was drawn down until the
date the capital is repaid, without any undue delay and no
later than 30 calendar days after the despatch by him to the
creditor of notification of the withdrawal. The interest shall
be calculated on the basis of the agreed borrowing rate. The
creditor shall not be entitled to any other compensation
from the consumer in the event of withdrawal, except
compensation for any non-returnable charges paid by the
creditor to any public administrative body.

Article 13
Open-end credit agreements
1. The consumer may effect standard termination of an openend credit agreement free of charge at any time unless the parties
have agreed on a period of notice. Such a period may not exceed
one month.
If agreed in the credit agreement, the creditor may effect standard
termination of an open-end credit agreement by giving the
consumer at least two months' notice drawn up on paper or on
another durable medium.
2. If agreed in the credit agreement, the creditor may, for
objectively justified reasons, terminate the consumer's right to
draw down on an open-end credit agreement. The creditor shall
inform the consumer of the termination and the reasons for it on
paper or on another durable medium, where possible before the
termination and at the latest immediately thereafter, unless the
provision of such information is prohibited by other Community
legislation or is contrary to objectives of public policy or public
security.

4. If an ancillary service relating to the credit agreement is
provided by the creditor or by a third party on the basis of an
agreement between the third party and the creditor, the
consumer shall no longer be bound by the ancillary service
contract if the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal from
the credit agreement in accordance with this Article.

5. If the consumer has a right of withdrawal under
paragraphs 1, 3 and 4, Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2002/65/
EC and Article 5 of Council Directive 85/577/EEC of
20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of
contracts negotiated away from business premises (1) shall not
apply.
6. Member States may provide that paragraphs 1 to 4 of this
Article shall not apply to credit agreements which by law are
required to be concluded through the services of a notary,
provided that the notary confirms that the consumer is
guaranteed the rights provided for under Articles 5 and 10.

the early repayment falls within a period for which the
borrowing rate is fixed.
Such compensation may not exceed 1 % of the amount of credit
repaid early, if the period of time between the early repayment
and the agreed termination of the credit agreement exceeds one
year. If the period does not exceed one year, the compensation
may not exceed 0,5 % of the amount of credit repaid early.
3. Compensation for early repayment shall not be claimed:
(a)

if the repayment has been made under an insurance
contract intended to provide a credit repayment guarantee;

(b)

in the case of overdraft facilities; or

(c)

if the repayment falls within a period for which the
borrowing rate is not fixed.

7. This Article shall be without prejudice to any rule of
national law establishing a period of time during which the
performance of the contract may not begin.

Article 15

22.5.2008

Linked credit agreements
1. Where the consumer has exercised a right of withdrawal,
based on Community law, concerning a contract for the supply
of goods or services, he shall no longer be bound by a linked
credit agreement.
2. Where the goods or services covered by a linked credit
agreement are not supplied, or are supplied only in part, or are
not in conformity with the contract for the supply thereof, the
consumer shall have the right to pursue remedies against the
creditor if the consumer has pursued his remedies against the
supplier but has failed to obtain the satisfaction to which he is
entitled according to the law or the contract for the supply of
goods or services. Member States shall determine to what extent
and under what conditions those remedies shall be exercisable.
3. This Article shall be without prejudice to any national rules
rendering the creditor jointly and severally liable in respect of
any claim which the consumer may have against the supplier
where the purchase of goods or services from the supplier has
been financed by a credit agreement.

4. Member States may provide that:
(a)

such compensation may be claimed by the creditor only on
condition that the amount of the early repayment exceeds
the threshold defined by national law. That threshold shall
not exceed EUR 10 000 within any period of 12 months;

(b)

the creditor may exceptionally claim higher compensation
if he can prove that the loss he suffered from early
repayment exceeds the amount determined under paragraph 2.
If the compensation claimed by the creditor exceeds the
loss actually suffered, the consumer may claim a corresponding reduction.
In this case, the loss shall consist of the difference between
the initially agreed interest rate and the interest rate at
which the creditor can lend out the amount repaid early on
the market at the time of early repayment, and shall take
into account the impact of early repayment on administrative costs.

Article 16
Early repayment
1. The consumer shall be entitled at any time to discharge fully
or partially his obligations under a credit agreement. In such
cases, he shall be entitled to a reduction in the total cost of the
credit, such reduction consisting of the interest and the costs for
the remaining duration of the contract.

5. Any compensation shall not exceed the amount of interest
the consumer would have paid during the period between the
early repayment and the agreed date of termination of the credit
agreement.

Article 17
2. In the event of early repayment of credit the creditor shall be
entitled to fair and objectively justified compensation for possible
costs directly linked to early repayment of credit provided that

Assignment of rights
1. In the event of assignment to a third party of the creditor's
rights under a credit agreement or the agreement itself, the
consumer shall be entitled to plead against the assignee any

22.5.2008

defence which was available to him against the original creditor,
including set-off where the latter is permitted in the Member
State concerned.
2. The consumer shall be informed of the assignment referred
to in paragraph 1 except where the original creditor, by
agreement with the assignee, continues to service the credit
vis-à-vis the consumer.

Article 18

L 133/81

payment for both payment transactions and drawdowns, and
other costs relating to payment transactions shall be included in
the total cost of credit to the consumer unless the opening of the
account is optional and the costs of the account have been
clearly and separately shown in the credit agreement or in any
other agreement concluded with the consumer.
3. The calculation of the annual percentage rate of charge shall
be based on the assumption that the credit agreement is to
remain valid for the period agreed and that the creditor and the
consumer will fulfil their obligations under the terms and by the
dates specified in the credit agreement.

Overrunning
1. In the case of an agreement to open a current account,
where there is a possibility that the consumer is allowed an
overrun, the agreement shall contain in addition the information
referred to in Article 6(1)(e). The creditor shall in any case
provide that information on paper or another durable medium
on a regular basis.
2. In the event of a significant overrunning exceeding a period
of one month, the creditor shall inform the consumer without
delay, on paper or on another durable medium,
(a)

of the overrunning;

(b)

of the amount involved;

(c)

of the borrowing rate;

(d)

of any penalties, charges or interest on arrears applicable.

3. This Article shall be without prejudice to any rule of
national law requiring the creditor to offer another kind of credit
product when the duration of the overrunning is significant.

4. In the case of credit agreements containing clauses allowing
variations in the borrowing rate and, where applicable, charges
contained in the annual percentage rate of charge but
unquantifiable at the time of calculation, the annual percentage
rate of charge shall be calculated on the assumption that the
borrowing rate and other charges will remain fixed in relation to
the initial level and will remain applicable until the end of the
credit agreement.
5. Where necessary, the additional assumptions set out in
Annex I may be used in calculating the annual percentage rate of
charge.
If the assumptions set out in this Article and in Part II of Annex I
do not suffice to calculate the annual percentage rate of charge in
a uniform manner or are not adapted any more to the
commercial situation at the market, the Commission may
determine the necessary additional assumptions for the calculation of the annual percentage rate of charge, or modify existing
ones. These measures, designed to amend non-essential elements
of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the
regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(2).

the first time 12 May 2013, a review of the thresholds laid down
in this Directive and its annexes and the percentages used to
calculate the compensation payable in the event of early
repayment, assessing them in the light of economic trends in
the Community and the situation of the market concerned. The
Commission shall also monitor the effect of the existence of the
regulatory choices referred to in Article 2(5) and 2(6), Article 4(1), Article 4(2)(c), Article 6(2), Article 10(1), Article 10(2)(g), Article 14(2) and Article 16(4) on the internal

ANNEX I

I.

The basic equation expressing the equivalence of drawdowns on the one hand and repayments and charges on the
other.
The basic equation, which establishes the annual percentage rate of charge (APR), equates, on an annual basis, the total
present value of drawdowns on the one hand and the total present value of repayments and payments of charges on
the other hand, i.e.:
m

m0

k=1

l=1

∑ Ck ð1 þ XÞ − tk = ∑ Dl ð1 þ XÞ − Sl

where:
— X is the APR,
— m is the number of the last drawdown,
— k

is the number of a drawdown, thus 1 ≤ k ≤ m,

— Ck is the amount of drawdown k,
— tk is the interval, expressed in years and fractions of a year, between the date of the first drawdown and the date
of each subsequent drawdown, thus t1 = 0,
— m’ is the number of the last repayment or payment of charges,
— l

is the number of a repayment or payment of charges,

— Dl is the amount of a repayment or payment of charges,
— sl

is the interval, expressed in years and fractions of a year, between the date of the first drawdown and the date
of each repayment or payment of charges.

Remarks:
(a)

The amounts paid by both parties at different times shall not necessarily be equal and shall not necessarily be
paid at equal intervals.

(b)

The starting date shall be that of the first drawdown.

(c)

Intervals between dates used in the calculations shall be expressed in years or in fractions of a year. A year is
presumed to have 365 days (or 366 days for leap years), 52 weeks or 12 equal months. An equal month is
presumed to have 30,41666 days (i.e. 365/12) regardless of whether or not it is a leap year.

(d)

The result of the calculation shall be expressed with an accuracy of at least one decimal place. If the figure at the
following decimal place is greater than or equal to 5, the figure at that particular decimal place shall be increased
by one.

(e)

The equation can be rewritten using a single sum and the concept of flows (A k), which will be positive or
negative, in other words either paid or received during periods 1 to k, expressed in years, i.e.:
n

S = ∑ Ak ð1 þ XÞ − tk ,
k=1

S being the present balance of flows. If the aim is to maintain the equivalence of flows, the value will be zero.

II.

Additional assumptions for the calculation of the annual percentage rate of charge
(a)

if a credit agreement gives the consumer freedom of drawdown, the total amount of credit shall be deemed to be
drawn down immediately and in full;

(b)

if a credit agreement provides different ways of drawdown with different charges or borrowing rates, the total
amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down at the highest charge and borrowing rate applied to the
most common drawdown mechanism for this type of credit agreement;

22.5.2008

22.5.2008

Official Journal of the European Union

EN
(c)

if a credit agreement gives the consumer freedom of drawdown in general but imposes, amongst the different
ways of drawdown, a limitation with regard to the amount and period of time, the amount of credit shall be
deemed to be drawn down on the earliest date provided for in the agreement and in accordance with those
drawdown limits;

(d)

if there is no fixed timetable for repayment, it shall be assumed:
(i)

that the credit is provided for a period of one year; and

(ii)

that the credit will be repaid in 12 equal instalments and at monthly intervals;

(e)

if there is a fixed timetable for repayment but the amount of such repayments is flexible, the amount of each
repayment shall be deemed to be the lowest for which the agreement provides;

(f)

unless otherwise specified, where the credit agreement provides for more than one repayment date, the credit is
to be made available and the repayments made on the earliest date provided for in the agreement;

(g)

if the ceiling applicable to the credit has not yet been agreed, that ceiling is assumed to be EUR 1 500;

(h)

in the case of an overdraft facility the total amount of credit shall be deemed to be drawn down in full and for
the whole duration of the credit agreement. If the duration of the credit agreement is not known the annual
percentage rate of charge shall be calculated on the assumption that the duration of the credit is three months;

(i)

if different interest rates and charges are offered for a limited period or amount, the interest rate and the charges
shall be deemed to be the highest rate for the whole duration of the credit agreement;

(j)

for consumer credit agreements for which a fixed borrowing rate is agreed in relation to the initial period, at the
end of which a new borrowing rate is determined and subsequently periodically adjusted according to an agreed
indicator, the calculation of the annual percentage rate shall be based on the assumption that, at the end of the
fixed borrowing rate period, the borrowing rate is the same as at the time of calculating the annual percentage
rate, based on the value of the agreed indicator at that time.
