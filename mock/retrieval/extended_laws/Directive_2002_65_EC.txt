DIRECTIVE 2002/65/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 23 September 2002
concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services and amending Council Directive
90/619/EEC and Directives 97/7/EC and 98/27/EC
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community, and in particular Article 47(2), Article 55 and
Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social
Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article
251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) It is important, in the context of achieving the aims of
the single market, to adopt measures designed to consolidate progressively this market and those measures must
contribute to attaining a high level of consumer protection, in accordance with Articles 95 and 153 of the
Treaty.
(2) Both for consumers and suppliers of financial services,
the distance marketing of financial services will constitute one of the main tangible results of the completion
of the internal market.
(3) Within the framework of the internal market, it is in the
interest of consumers to have access without discrimination to the widest possible range of financial services
available in the Community so that they can choose
those that are best suited to their needs. In order to
safeguard freedom of choice, which is an essential
consumer right, a high degree of consumer protection is
required in order to enhance consumer confidence in
distance selling.
(4) It is essential to the smooth operation of the internal
market for consumers to be able to negotiate and
conclude contracts with a supplier established in other
Member States, regardless of whether the supplier is also
established in the Member State in which the consumer
resides.
(5) Because of their intangible nature, financial services are
particularly suited to distance selling and the establishment of a legal framework governing the distance
marketing of financial services should increase consumer
confidence in the use of new techniques for the distance
marketing of financial services, such as electronic
commerce.
(6) This Directive should be applied in conformity with the
Treaty and with secondary law, including Directive
2000/31/EC (4) on electronic commerce, the latter being
applicable solely to the transactions which it covers.
(7) This Directive aims to achieve the objectives set forth
above without prejudice to Community or national law
governing freedom to provide services or, where applicable, host Member State control and/or authorisation or
supervision systems in the Member States where this is
compatible with Community legislation.
(8) Moreover, this Directive, and in particular its provisions
relating to information about any contractual clause on
law applicable to the contract and/or on the competent
court does not affect the applicability to the distance
marketing of consumer financial services of Council
Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on
jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of
judgements in civil and commercial matters (5) or of the
1980 Rome Convention on the law applicable to
contractual obligations.
(9) The achievement of the objectives of the Financial
Services Action Plan requires a higher level of consumer
protection in certain areas. This implies a greater convergence, in particular, in non harmonised collective investment funds, rules of conduct applicable to investment
services and consumer credits. Pending the achievement
of the above convergence, a high level of consumer
protection should be maintained.
(10) Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 20 May 1997 on the protection of
consumers in respect of distance contracts (6), lays down
the main rules applicable to distance contracts for goods
or services concluded between a supplier and a
consumer. However, that Directive does not cover financial services.

(11) In the context of the analysis conducted by the Commission with a view to ascertaining the need for specific
measures in the field of financial services, the Commission invited all the interested parties to transmit their
comments, notably in connection with the preparation
of its Green Paper entitled ‘Financial Services — Meeting
Consumers' Expectations’. The consultations in this
context showed that there is a need to strengthen
consumer protection in this area. The Commission
therefore decided to present a specific proposal
concerning the distance marketing of financial services.
(12) The adoption by the Member States of conflicting or
different consumer protection rules governing the
distance marketing of consumer financial services could
impede the functioning of the internal market and
competition between firms in the market. It is therefore
necessary to enact common rules at Community level in
this area, consistent with no reduction in overall
consumer protection in the Member States.
(13) A high level of consumer protection should be guaranteed by this Directive, with a view to ensuring the free
movement of financial services. Member States should
not be able to adopt provisions other than those laid
down in this Directive in the fields it harmonises, unless
otherwise specifically indicated in it.
(14) This Directive covers all financial services liable to be
provided at a distance. However, certain financial
services are governed by specific provisions of
Community legislation which continue to apply to those
financial services. However, principles governing the
distance marketing of such services should be laid down.
(15) Contracts negotiated at a distance involve the use of
means of distance communication which are used as
part of a distance sales or service-provision scheme not
involving the simultaneous presence of the supplier and
the consumer. The constant development of those
means of communication requires principles to be
defined that are valid even for those means which are
not yet in widespread use. Therefore, distance contracts
are those the offer, negotiation and conclusion of which
are carried out at a distance.
(16) A single contract involving successive operations or
separate operations of the same nature performed over
time may be subject to different legal treatment in the
different Member States, but it is important that this
Directive be applied in the same way in all the Member
States. To that end, it is appropriate that this Directive
should be considered to apply to the first of a series of
successive operations or separate operations of the same
nature performed over time which may be considered as
forming a whole, irrespective of whether that operation
or series of operations is the subject of a single contract
or several successive contracts.
(17) An ‘initial service agreement’ may be considered to be
for example the opening of a bank account, acquiring a
credit card, concluding a portfolio management
contract, and ‘operations’ may be considered to be for
example the deposit or withdrawal of funds to or from
the bank account, payment by credit card, transactions
made within the framework of a portfolio management
contract. Adding new elements to an initial service
agreement, such as a possibility to use an electronic
payment instrument together with one's existing bank
account, does not constitute an ‘operation’ but an additional contract to which this Directive applies. The
subscription to new units of the same collective investment fund is considered to be one of ‘successive operations of the same nature’.
(18) By covering a service-provision scheme organised by the
financial services provider, this Directive aims to exclude
from its scope services provided on a strictly occasional
basis and outside a commercial structure dedicated to
the conclusion of distance contracts.
(19) The supplier is the person providing services at a
distance. This Directive should however also apply when
one of the marketing stages involves an intermediary.
Having regard to the nature and degree of that involvement, the pertinent provisions of this Directive should
apply to such an intermediary, irrespective of his or her
legal status.
(20) Durable mediums include in particular floppy discs, CDROMs, DVDs and the hard drive of the consumer's
computer on which the electronic mail is stored, but
they do not include Internet websites unless they fulfil
the criteria contained in the definition of a durable
medium.
(21) The use of means of distance communications should
not lead to an unwarranted restriction on the information provided to the client. In the interests of transparency this Directive lays down the requirements needed
to ensure that an appropriate level of information is
provided to the consumer both before and after conclusion of the contract. The consumer should receive,
before conclusion of the contract, the prior information
needed so as to properly appraise the financial service
offered to him and hence make a well-informed choice.
The supplier should specify how long his offer applies as
it stands.
(22) Information items listed in this Directive cover information of a general nature applicable to all kinds of financial services. Other information requirements concerning
a given financial service, such as the coverage of an
insurance policy, are not solely specified in this
Directive. This kind of information should be provided
in accordance, where applicable, with relevant
Community legislation or national legislation in
conformity with Community law.
L 271/18 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 9.10.2002
(23) With a view to optimum protection of the consumer, it
is important that the consumer is adequately informed
of the provisions of this Directive and of any codes of
conduct existing in this area and that he has a right of
withdrawal.
(24) When the right of withdrawal does not apply because
the consumer has expressly requested the performance
of a contract, the supplier should inform the consumer
of this fact.
(25) Consumers should be protected against unsolicited
services. Consumers should be exempt from any obligation in the case of unsolicited services, the absence of a
reply not being construed as signifying consent on their
part. However, this rule should be without prejudice to
the tacit renewal of contracts validly concluded between
the parties whenever the law of the Member States
permits such tacit renewal.
(26) Member States should take appropriate measures to
protect effectively consumers who do not wish to be
contacted through certain means of communication or
at certain times. This Directive should be without prejudice to the particular safeguards available to consumers
under Community legislation concerning the protection
of personal data and privacy.
(27) With a view to protecting consumers, there is a need for
suitable and effective complaint and redress procedures
in the Member States with a view to settling potential
disputes between suppliers and consumers, by using,
where appropriate, existing procedures.
(28) Member States should encourage public or private
bodies established with a view to settling disputes out of
court to cooperate in resolving cross-border disputes.
Such cooperation could in particular entail allowing
consumers to submit to extra-judicial bodies in the
Member State of their residence complaints concerning
suppliers established in other Member States. The establishment of FIN-NET offers increased assistance to
consumers when using cross-border services.
(29) This Directive is without prejudice to extension by
Member States, in accordance with Community law, of
the protection provided by this Directive to non-profit
organisations and persons making use of financial
services in order to become entrepreneurs.
(30) This Directive should also cover cases where the national
legislation includes the concept of a consumer making a
binding contractual statement.
(31) The provisions in this Directive on the supplier's choice
of language should be without prejudice to provisions of
national legislation, adopted in conformity with
Community law governing the choice of language.
(32) The Community and the Member States have entered
into commitments in the context of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) concerning the possibility for consumers to purchase banking and investment services abroad. The GATS entitles Member States
to adopt measures for prudential reasons, including
measures to protect investors, depositors, policy-holders
and persons to whom a financial service is owed by the
supplier of the financial service. Such measures should
not impose restrictions going beyond what is required to
ensure the protection of consumers.
(33) In view of the adoption of this Directive, the scope of
Directive 97/7/EC and Directive 98/27/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 1998 on
injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests (1)
and the scope of the cancellation period in Council
Directive 90/619/EEC of 8 November 1990 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct life assurance, laying down provisions to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom to
provide services (2) should be adapted.
(34) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the establishment of common rules on the distance marketing of
consumer financial services cannot be sufficiently
achieved by the Member States and can therefore be
better achieved at Community level, the Community
may adopt measures, in accordance with the principles
of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In
accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set
out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond
what is necessary to achieve that objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Object and scope
1. The object of this Directive is to approximate the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States
concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial
services.
2. In the case of contracts for financial services comprising
an initial service agreement followed by successive operations
or a series of separate operations of the same nature performed
over time, the provisions of this Directive shall apply only to
the initial agreement.
(
1) OJ L 166, 11.6.1998, p. 51. Directive as last amended by Directive 2000/31/EC (OJ L 178, 17.7.2001, p. 1).
(
2) OJ L 330, 29.11.1990, p. 50. Directive as last amended by
Directive 92/96/EEC (OJ L 360, 9.12.1992, p. 1).
9.10.2002 EN Official Journal of the European Communities L 271/19
In case there is no initial service agreement but the successive
operations or the separate operations of the same nature
performed over time are performed between the same contractual parties, Articles 3 and 4 apply only when the first operation is performed. Where, however, no operation of the same
nature is performed for more than one year, the next operation
will be deemed to be the first in a new series of operations and,
accordingly, Articles 3 and 4 shall apply.
Article 2

3. At any time during the contractual relationship the
consumer is entitled, at his request, to receive the contractual
terms and conditions on paper. In addition, the consumer is
entitled to change the means of distance communication used,
unless this is incompatible with the contract concluded or the
nature of the financial service provided.
Article 6
Right of withdrawal
1. The Member States shall ensure that the consumer shall
have a period of 14 calendar days to withdraw from the
contract without penalty and without giving any reason.
However, this period shall be extended to 30 calendar days in
distance contracts relating to life insurance covered by
Directive 90/619/EEC and personal pension operations.
The period for withdrawal shall begin:
— either from the day of the conclusion of the distance
contract, except in respect of the said life assurance, where
the time limit will begin from the time when the consumer
is informed that the distance contract has been concluded,
or
— from the day on which the consumer receives the contractual terms and conditions and the information in accordance with Article 5(1) or (2), if that is later than the date
referred to in the first indent.
Member States, in addition to the right of withdrawal, may
provide that the enforceability of contracts relating to investment services is suspended for the same period provided for in
this paragraph.
2. The right of withdrawal shall not apply to:
(a) financial services whose price depends on fluctuations in
the financial market outside the suppliers control, which
may occur during the withdrawal period, such as services
related to:
— foreign exchange,
— money market instruments,
— transferable securities,
— units in collective investment undertakings,
— financial-futures contracts, including equivalent cashsettled instruments,
— forward interest-rate agreements (FRAs),
— interest-rate, currency and equity swaps,
— options to acquire or dispose of any instruments
referred to in this point including equivalent cashsettled instruments. This category includes in particular
options on currency and on interest rates;
(b) travel and baggage insurance policies or similar short-term
insurance policies of less than one month's duration;
(c) contracts whose performance has been fully completed by
both parties at the consumer's express request before the
consumer exercises his right of withdrawal.
3. Member States may provide that the right of withdrawal
shall not apply to:
(a) any credit intended primarily for the purpose of acquiring
or retaining property rights in land or in an existing or
projected building, or for the purpose of renovating or
improving a building, or
(b) any credit secured either by mortgage on immovable property or by a right related to immovable property, or
(c) declarations by consumers using the services of an official,
provided that the official confirms that the consumer is
guaranteed the rights under Article 5(1).
This paragraph shall be without prejudice to the right to a
reflection time to the benefit of the consumers that are resident
in those Member States where it exists, at the time of the
adoption of this Directive.
4. Member States making use of the possibility set out in
paragraph 3 shall communicate it to the Commission.
5. The Commission shall make available the information
communicated by Member States to the European Parliament
and the Council and shall ensure that it is also available to
consumers and suppliers who request it.
6. If the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal he shall,
before the expiry of the relevant deadline, notify this following
the practical instructions given to him in accordance with
Article 3(1)(3)(d) by means which can be proved in accordance
with national law. The deadline shall be deemed to have been
observed if the notification, if it is on paper or on another
durable medium available and accessible to the recipient, is
dispatched before the deadline expires.
7. This Article does not apply to credit agreements cancelled
under the conditions of Article 6(4) of Directive 97/7/EC or
Article 7 of Directive 94/47/EC of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 26 October 1994 on the protection of
purchasers in respect of certain aspects of contracts relating to
the purchase of the right to use immovable properties on a
timeshare basis (1).
(
1) OJ L 280, 29.10.1994, p. 83.
L 271/22 EN Official Journal of the European Communities 9.10.2002
If to a distance contract of a given financial service another
distance contract has been attached concerning services
provided by the supplier or by a third party on the basis of an
agreement between the third party and the supplier, this additional distance contract shall be cancelled, without any penalty,
if the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal as provided
for in Article 6(1).
8. The provisions of this Article are without prejudice to the
Member States' laws and regulations governing the cancellation
or termination or non-enforceability of a distance contract or
the right of a consumer to fulfil his contractual obligations
before the time fixed in the distance contract. This applies
irrespective of the conditions for and the legal effects of the
winding-up of the contract.
Article 7
Payment of the service provided before withdrawal
1. When the consumer exercises his right of withdrawal
under Article 6(1) he may only be required to pay, without any
undue delay, for the service actually provided by the supplier in
accordance with the contract. The performance of the contract
may only begin after the consumer has given his approval. The
amount payable shall not:
— exceed an amount which is in proportion to the extent of
the service already provided in comparison with the full
coverage of the contract,
— in any case be such that it could be construed as a penalty.
2. Member States may provide that the consumer cannot be
required to pay any amount when withdrawing from an insurance contract.
3. The supplier may not require the consumer to pay any
amount on the basis of paragraph 1 unless he can prove that
the consumer was duly informed about the amount payable, in
conformity with Article 3(1)(3)(a). However, in no case may he
require such payment if he has commenced the performance of
the contract before the expiry of the withdrawal period
provided for in Article 6(1) without the consumer's prior
request.
4. The supplier shall, without any undue delay and no later
than within 30 calendar days, return to the consumer any sums
he has received from him in accordance with the distance
contract, except for the amount referred to in paragraph 1.
This period shall begin from the day on which the supplier
receives the notification of withdrawal.
5. The consumer shall return to the supplier any sums
and/or property he has received from the supplier without any
undue delay and no later than within 30 calendar days. This
period shall begin from the day on which the consumer
dispatches the notification of withdrawal.
Article 8
Payment by card
Member States shall ensure that appropriate measures exist to
allow a consumer:
— to request cancellation of a payment where fraudulent use
has been made of his payment card in connection with
distance contracts,
— in the event of such fraudulent use, to be re-credited with
the sum paid or have them returned.
Article 9
Unsolicited services
Without prejudice to Member States provisions on the tacit
renewal of distance contracts, when such rules permit tacit
renewal, Member States shall take the necessary measures to:
— prohibit the supply of financial services to a consumer
without a prior request on his part, when this supply
includes a request for immediate or deferred payment,
— exempt the consumer from any obligation in the event of
unsolicited supplies, the absence of a reply not constituting
consent.
Article 10
Unsolicited communications
1. The use by a supplier of the following distance communication techniques shall require the consumer's prior consent:
(a) automated calling systems without human intervention
(automatic calling machines);
(b) fax machines.
