DIRECTIVES
DIRECTIVE 2009/22/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 23 April 2009
on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests
(Codified version)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE
EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and
Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 98/27/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 19 May 1998 on injunctions for the
protection of consumers' interests (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity
and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2) Certain Directives, listed in Annex I to this Directive, lay
down rules with regard to the protection of consumers'
interests.
(3) Current mechanisms available for ensuring compliance
with those Directives, both at national and at
Community level, do not always allow infringements
harmful to the collective interests of consumers to be
terminated in good time. Collective interests means
interests which do not include the cumulation of
interests of individuals who have been harmed by an
infringement. This is without prejudice to individual
actions brought by individuals who have been harmed
by an infringement.
(4) As far as the purpose of bringing about the cessation of
practices that are unlawful under the national provisions
applicable is concerned, the effectiveness of national
measures transposing the Directives in question,
including protective measures that go beyond the level
required by those Directives, provided they are
compatible with the Treaty and allowed by those
Directives, may be thwarted where those practices
produce effects in a Member State other than that in
which they originate.
(5) Those difficulties can disrupt the smooth functioning of
the internal market, their consequence being that it is
sufficient to move the source of an unlawful practice
to another country in order to place it out of reach of
all forms of enforcement. This constitutes a distortion of
competition.
(6) Those difficulties are likely to diminish consumer
confidence in the internal market and may limit the
scope for action by organisations representing the
collective interests of consumers or independent public
bodies responsible for protecting the collective interests
of consumers, adversely affected by practices that infringe
Community law.
(7) Those practices often extend beyond the frontiers
between the Member States. There is an urgent need
for some degree of approximation of national provisions
designed to enjoin the cessation of the unlawful practices
irrespective of the Member State in which the unlawful
practice has produced its effects. With regard to jurisdiction, this is without prejudice to the rules of private
international law and the Conventions in force between
Member States, while respecting the general obligations
of the Member States deriving from the Treaty, in
particular those related to the smooth functioning of
the internal market.
(8) The objective of the action envisaged can only be
attained by the Community. It is therefore incumbent
on the Community to act.

4) See Annex II, Part A.
(9) The third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty makes it
incumbent on the Community not to go beyond what is
necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty. In
accordance with that Article, the specific features of
national legal systems must be taken into account to
every extent possible by leaving Member States free to
choose between different options having equivalent
effect. The courts or administrative authorities
competent to rule on the proceedings referred to in
this Directive should have the right to examine the
effects of previous decisions.
(10) One option should consist in requiring one or more
independent public bodies, specifically responsible for
the protection of the collective interests of consumers,
to exercise the rights of action set out in this Directive.
Another option should provide for the exercise of those
rights by organisations whose purpose is to protect the
collective interests of consumers, in accordance with
criteria laid down by national law.
(11) Member States should be able to choose between or
combine these two options in designating at national
level the bodies and/or organisations qualified for the
purposes of this Directive.
(12) For the purposes of intra-Community infringements the
principle of mutual recognition should apply to these
bodies and/or organisations. The Member States should,
at the request of their national entities, communicate to
the Commission the name and purpose of their national
entities which are qualified to bring an action in their
own country according to the provisions of this
Directive.
(13) It is the business of the Commission to ensure the publication of a list of these qualified entities in the Official
Journal of the European Union. Until a statement to the
contrary is published, a qualified entity is assumed to
have legal capacity if its name is included in that list.
(14) Member States should be able to require that a prior
consultation be undertaken by the party that intends to
bring an action for an injunction, in order to give the
defendant an opportunity to bring the contested infringement to an end. Member States should be able to
require that this prior consultation take place jointly with
an independent public body designated by those Member
States.
(15) Where the Member States have established that there
should be prior consultation, a deadline of two weeks
after the request for consultation is received should be set
after which, should the cessation of the infringement not
be achieved, the applicant shall be entitled to bring an
action, without any further delay, before the competent
court or administrative authority.
(16) It is appropriate that the Commission report on the
functioning of this Directive and in particular on its
scope and on the operation of prior consultation.
(17) The application of this Directive should not prejudice the
application of Community competition rules.
(18) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits
for transposition and application in national law of the
Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Scope
1. The purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States
relating to actions for an injunction referred to in Article 2
aimed at the protection of the collective interests of
consumers included in the Directives listed in Annex I, with a
view to ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market.
2. For the purposes of this Directive, an infringement means
any act contrary to the Directives listed in Annex I as
transposed into the internal legal order of the Member States
which harms the collective interests referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 2
Actions for an injunction
1. Member States shall designate the courts or administrative
authorities competent to rule on proceedings commenced by
qualified entities within the meaning of Article 3 seeking:
(a) an order with all due expediency, where appropriate by way
of summary procedure, requiring the cessation or prohibition of any infringement;
(b) where appropriate, measures such as the publication of the
decision, in full or in part, in such form as deemed adequate
and/or the publication of a corrective statement with a view
to eliminating the continuing effects of the infringement;
(c) in so far as the legal system of the Member State concerned
so permits, an order against the losing defendant for
payments into the public purse or to any beneficiary
designated in or under national legislation, in the event of
failure to comply with the decision within a time limit
specified by the courts or administrative authorities, of a
fixed amount for each day’s delay or any other amount
provided for in national legislation, with a view to
ensuring compliance with the decisions.
1.5.2009 Official Journal of the European Union L 110/31 EN
2. This Directive shall be without prejudice to the rules of
private international law with respect to the applicable law, that
is, normally, either the law of the Member State where the
infringement originated or the law of the Member State
where the infringement has its effects.
Article 3
Entities qualified to bring an action
For the purposes of this Directive, a ‘qualified entity’ means any
body or organisation which, being properly constituted
according to the law of a Member State, has a legitimate
interest in ensuring that the provisions referred to in
Article 1 are complied with, in particular:
(a) one or more independent public bodies, specifically
responsible for protecting the interests referred to in
Article 1, in Member States in which such bodies exist;
and/or
(b) organisations whose purpose is to protect the interests
referred to in Article 1, in accordance with the criteria
laid down by the national law.
Article 4
Intra-Community infringements
1. Each Member State shall take the measures necessary to
ensure that, in the event of an infringement originating in that
Member State, any qualified entity from another Member State
where the interests protected by that qualified entity are affected
by the infringement, may apply to the court or administrative
authority referred to in Article 2, on presentation of the list
provided for in paragraph 3 of this Article. The courts or
administrative authorities shall accept this list as proof of the
legal capacity of the qualified entity without prejudice to their
right to examine whether the purpose of the qualified entity
justifies its taking action in a specific case.
2. For the purposes of intra-Community infringements, and
without prejudice to the rights granted to other entities under
national legislation, the Member States shall, at the request of
their qualified entities, communicate to the Commission that
these entities are qualified to bring an action under Article 2.
The Member States shall inform the Commission of the name
and purpose of these qualified entities.
3. The Commission shall draw up a list of the qualified
entities referred to in paragraph 2, with the specification of
their purpose. This list shall be published in the Official
Journal of the European Union; changes to this list shall be
published without delay and the updated list shall be
published every six months.
Article 5
Prior consultation
1. Member States may introduce or maintain in force
provisions whereby the party that intends to seek an injunction
can only start this procedure after it has tried to achieve the
cessation of the infringement in consultation either with the
defendant or with both the defendant and a qualified entity
within the meaning of Article 3(a) of the Member State in
which the injunction is sought. It shall be for the Member
State to decide whether the party seeking the injunction must
consult the qualified entity. If the cessation of the infringement
is not achieved within two weeks after the request for consultation is received, the party concerned may bring an action for
an injunction without any further delay.
2. The rules governing prior consultation adopted by
Member States shall be notified to the Commission and shall
be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Article 6
Reports
1. Every three years and for the first time no later than 2 July
2003 the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament
and to the Council a report on the application of this Directive.
2. In its first report the Commission shall examine in
particular:
(a) the scope of this Directive in relation to the protection of
the collective interests of persons exercising a commercial,
industrial, craft or professional activity;
(b) the scope of this Directive as determined by the Directives
listed in Annex I;
(c) whether the prior consultation provided for in Article 5 has
contributed to the effective protection of consumers.
Where appropriate, this report shall be accompanied by
proposals with a view to amending this Directive.
Article 7
Provisions for wider action
This Directive shall not prevent Member States from adopting
or maintaining in force provisions designed to grant qualified
entities and any other person concerned more extensive rights
to bring action at national level.
L 110/32 Official Journal of the European Union 1.5.2009 EN
