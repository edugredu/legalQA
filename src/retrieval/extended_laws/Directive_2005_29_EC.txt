law, regulation or administrative provision of a Member State which

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 3

Scope
1.
This Directive shall apply to unfair business-to-consumer
commercial practices, as laid down in Article 5, before, during and
after a commercial transaction in relation to a product.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 4
▼B
2.
This Directive is without prejudice to contract law and, in
particular, to the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract.
3.
This Directive is without prejudice to Community or national rules
relating to the health and safety aspects of products.
4.
In the case of conflict between the provisions of this Directive and
other Community rules regulating specific aspects of unfair commercial
practices, the latter shall prevail and apply to those specific aspects.
▼M1
5.
This Directive does not prevent Member States from adopting
provisions to protect the legitimate interests of consumers with regard
to aggressive or misleading marketing or selling practices in the context
of unsolicited visits by a trader to a consumer’s home or excursions
organised by a trader with the aim or effect of promoting or selling
products to consumers. Such provisions shall be proportionate, nondiscriminatory and justified on grounds of consumer protection.
6.
Member States shall notify the Commission without delay of any
national provisions adopted on the basis of paragraph 5 as well as of
any subsequent changes. The Commission shall make this information
easily accessible to consumers and traders on a dedicated website.
▼B
7.
This Directive is without prejudice to the rules determining the
jurisdiction of the courts.
8.
This Directive is without prejudice to any conditions of estab­
lishment or of authorisation regimes, or to the deontological codes of
conduct or other specific rules governing regulated professions in order
to uphold high standards of integrity on the part of the professional,
which Member States may, in conformity with Community law, impose
on professionals.
9.
In relation to ‘financial services’, as defined in Directive
2002/65/EC, and immovable property, Member States may impose
requirements which are more restrictive or prescriptive than this
Directive in the field which it approximates.
10.
This Directive shall not apply to the application of the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions of Member States relating to
the certification and indication of the standard of fineness of articles of
precious metal.

Article 4
Internal market
Member States shall neither restrict the freedom to provide services nor
restrict the free movement of goods for reasons falling within the field
approximated by this Directive.

CHAPTER 2
UNFAIR COMMERCIAL PRACTICES

Article 5
Prohibition of unfair commercial practices
1.

Unfair commercial practices shall be prohibited.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 5
▼B
2.

A commercial practice shall be unfair if:

(a) it is contrary to the requirements of professional diligence,
and
(b) it materially distorts or is likely to materially distort the economic
behaviour with regard to the product of the average consumer
whom it reaches or to whom it is addressed, or of the average
member of the group when a commercial practice is directed to a
particular group of consumers.
3.
Commercial practices which are likely to materially distort the
economic behaviour only of a clearly identifiable group of consumers
who are particularly vulnerable to the practice or the underlying product
because of their mental or physical infirmity, age or credulity in a way
which the trader could reasonably be expected to foresee, shall be
assessed from the perspective of the average member of that group.
This is without prejudice to the common and legitimate advertising
practice of making exaggerated statements or statements which are
not meant to be taken literally.
4.

In particular, commercial practices shall be unfair which:

(a) are misleading as set out in Articles 6 and 7,
or
(b) are aggressive as set out in Articles 8 and 9.
5.
Annex I contains the list of those commercial practices which shall
in all circumstances be regarded as unfair. The same single list shall
apply in all Member States and may only be modified by revision of
this Directive.
Section 1
Misleading commercial practices

Article 6
Misleading actions
1.
A commercial practice shall be regarded as misleading if it
contains false information and is therefore untruthful or in any way,
including overall presentation, deceives or is likely to deceive the
average consumer, even if the information is factually correct, in
relation to one or more of the following elements, and in either case
causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision that he
would not have taken otherwise:
(a) the existence or nature of the product;
(b) the main characteristics of the product, such as its availability,
benefits, risks, execution, composition, accessories, after-sale
customer assistance and complaint handling, method and date of
manufacture or provision, delivery, fitness for purpose, usage,
quantity, specification, geographical or commercial origin or the
results to be expected from its use, or the results and material
features of tests or checks carried out on the product;
(c) the extent of the trader's commitments, the motives for the
commercial practice and the nature of the sales process, any
statement or symbol in relation to direct or indirect sponsorship
or approval of the trader or the product;

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 6
▼B
(d) the price or the manner in which the price is calculated, or the
existence of a specific price advantage;
(e) the need for a service, part, replacement or repair;
(f) the nature, attributes and rights of the trader or his agent, such as his
identity and assets, his qualifications, status, approval, affiliation or
connection and ownership of industrial, commercial or intellectual
property rights or his awards and distinctions;
(g) the consumer's rights, including the right to replacement or
reimbursement under Directive 1999/44/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 on certain aspects
of the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees (1), or the
risks he may face.
2.
A commercial practice shall also be regarded as misleading if, in
its factual context, taking account of all its features and circumstances, it
causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional
decision that he would not have taken otherwise, and it involves:
(a) any marketing of a product, including comparative advertising,
which creates confusion with any products, trade marks, trade
names or other distinguishing marks of a competitor;
(b) non-compliance by the trader with commitments contained in codes
of conduct by which the trader has undertaken to be bound, where:
(i) the commitment is not aspirational but is firm and is capable of
being verified,
and
(ii) the trader indicates in a commercial practice that he is bound by
the code;
▼M1
(c) any marketing of a good, in one Member State, as being identical to
a good marketed in other Member States, while that good has
significantly different composition or characteristics, unless
justified by legitimate and objective factors.
▼B
Article 7
Misleading omissions
1.
A commercial practice shall be regarded as misleading if, in its
factual context, taking account of all its features and circumstances and
the limitations of the communication medium, it omits material
information that the average consumer needs, according to the
context, to take an informed transactional decision and thereby causes
or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional
decision that he would not have taken otherwise.
(1) OJ L 171, 7.7.1999, p. 12.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 7
▼B
2.
It shall also be regarded as a misleading omission when, taking
account of the matters described in paragraph 1, a trader hides or
provides in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner
such material information as referred to in that paragraph or fails to
identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice if not already
apparent from the context, and where, in either case, this causes or is
likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision
that he would not have taken otherwise.

Where the medium used to communicate the commercial practice
3.
imposes limitations of space or time, these limitations and any measures
taken by the trader to make the information available to consumers by
other means shall be taken into account in deciding whether information
has been omitted.

In the case of an invitation to purchase, the following information
4.
shall be regarded as material, if not already apparent from the context:

(a) the main characteristics of the product, to an extent appropriate to
the medium and the product;

(b) the geographical address and the identity of the trader, such as his
trading name and, where applicable, the geographical address and
the identity of the trader on whose behalf he is acting;

(c) the price inclusive of taxes, or where the nature of the product
means that the price cannot reasonably be calculated in advance,
the manner in which the price is calculated, as well as, where
appropriate, all additional freight, delivery or postal charges or,
where these charges cannot reasonably be calculated in advance,
the fact that such additional charges may be payable;

▼M1
(d) the arrangements for payment, delivery and performance, if they
depart from the requirements of professional diligence;

▼B
(e) for products and transactions involving a right of withdrawal or
cancellation, the existence of such a right;

▼M1
(f) for products offered on online marketplaces, whether the third party
offering the products is a trader or not, on the basis of the
declaration of that third party to the provider of the online market­
place.

4a.
When providing consumers with the possibility to search for
products offered by different traders or by consumers on the basis of
a query in the form of a keyword, phrase or other input, irrespective of
where transactions are ultimately concluded, general information, made
available in a specific section of the online interface that is directly and
easily accessible from the page where the query results are presented, on
the main parameters determining the ranking of products presented to

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 8
▼M1
the consumer as a result of the search query and the relative importance
of those parameters, as opposed to other parameters, shall be regarded
as material. This paragraph does not apply to providers of online search
engines as defined in point (6) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU)
2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1).
▼B
5.
Information requirements established by Community law in
relation to commercial communication including advertising or
marketing, a non-exhaustive list of which is contained in Annex II,
shall be regarded as material.
▼M1
6.
Where a trader provides access to consumer reviews of products,
information about whether and how the trader ensures that the published
reviews originate from consumers who have actually used or purchased
the product shall be regarded as material.
▼B
Section 2
Aggressive commercial practices

Article 8
Aggressive commercial practices
A commercial practice shall be regarded as aggressive if, in its factual
context, taking account of all its features and circumstances, by
harassment, coercion, including the use of physical force, or undue
influence, it significantly impairs or is likely to significantly impair
the average consumer's freedom of choice or conduct with regard to
the product and thereby causes him or is likely to cause him to take a
transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.

Article 9
Use of harassment, coercion and undue influence
In determining whether a commercial practice uses harassment,
coercion, including the use of physical force, or undue influence,
account shall be taken of:
(a) its timing, location, nature or persistence;
(b) the use of threatening or abusive language or behaviour;
(c) the exploitation by the trader of any specific misfortune or circum­
stance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgement, of
which the trader is aware, to influence the consumer's decision with
regard to the product;
(d) any onerous or disproportionate non-contractual barriers imposed by
the trader where a consumer wishes to exercise rights under the
contract, including rights to terminate a contract or to switch to
another product or another trader;
(e) any threat to take any action that cannot legally be taken.
(1) Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of
online intermediation services (OJ L 186, 11.7.2019, p. 57).

CHAPTER 3
CODES OF CONDUCT

Article 10
Codes of conduct
This Directive does not exclude the control, which Member States may
encourage, of unfair commercial practices by code owners and recourse
to such bodies by the persons or organisations referred to in Article 11
if proceedings before such bodies are in addition to the court or admin­
istrative proceedings referred to in that Article.
Recourse to such control bodies shall never be deemed the equivalent of
foregoing a means of judicial or administrative recourse as provided for
in Article 11.

CHAPTER 4
FINAL PROVISIONS

Article 11
Enforcement
1.
Member States shall ensure that adequate and effective means
exist to combat unfair commercial practices in order to enforce
compliance with the provisions of this Directive in the interest of
consumers.
Such means shall include legal provisions under which persons or
organisations regarded under national law as having a legitimate
interest in combating unfair commercial practices, including
competitors, may:
(a) take legal action against such unfair commercial practices;
and/or
(b) bring such unfair commercial practices before an administrative
authority competent either to decide on complaints or to initiate
appropriate legal proceedings.
It shall be for each Member State to decide which of these facilities
shall be available and whether to enable the courts or administrative
authorities to require prior recourse to other established means of
dealing with complaints, including those referred to in Article 10.
These facilities shall be available regardless of whether the consumers
affected are in the territory of the Member State where the trader is
located or in another Member State.
It shall be for each Member State to decide:
(a) whether these legal facilities may be directed separately or jointly
against a number of traders from the same economic sector;
and
(b) whether these legal facilities may be directed against a code owner
where the relevant code promotes non-compliance with legal
requirements.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 10
▼B
2.
Under the legal provisions referred to in paragraph 1, Member
States shall confer upon the courts or administrative authorities
powers enabling them, in cases where they deem such measures to be
necessary taking into account all the interests involved and in particular
the public interest:
(a) to order the cessation of, or to institute appropriate legal
proceedings for an order for the cessation of, unfair commercial
practices;
or
(b) if the unfair commercial practice has not yet been carried out but is
imminent, to order the prohibition of the practice, or to institute
appropriate legal proceedings for an order for the prohibition of
the practice,
even without proof of actual loss or damage or of intention or
negligence on the part of the trader.
Member States shall also make provision for the measures referred to in
the first subparagraph to be taken under an accelerated procedure:
— either with interim effect,
or
— with definitive effect,
on the understanding that it is for each Member State to decide which of
the two options to select.
Furthermore, Member States may confer upon the courts or administra­
tive authorities powers enabling them, with a view to eliminating the
continuing effects of unfair commercial practices the cessation of which
has been ordered by a final decision:
(a) to require publication of that decision in full or in part and in such
form as they deem adequate;
(b) to require in addition the publication of a corrective statement.
3.

The administrative authorities referred to in paragraph 1 must:

(a) be composed so as not to cast doubt on their impartiality;
(b) have adequate powers, where they decide on complaints, to monitor
and enforce the observance of their decisions effectively;
(c) normally give reasons for their decisions.
Where the powers referred to in paragraph 2 are exercised exclusively
by an administrative authority, reasons for its decisions shall always be
given. Furthermore, in this case, provision must be made for procedures
whereby improper or unreasonable exercise of its powers by the admin­
istrative authority or improper or unreasonable failure to exercise the
said powers can be the subject of judicial review.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 11
▼M1
Article 11a
Redress
1.
Consumers harmed by unfair commercial practices, shall have
access to proportionate and effective remedies, including compensation
for damage suffered by the consumer and, where relevant, a price
reduction or the termination of the contract. Member States may
determine the conditions for the application and effects of those
remedies. Member States may take into account, where appropriate,
the gravity and nature of the unfair commercial practice, the damage
suffered by the consumer and other relevant circumstances.
2.
Those remedies shall be without prejudice to the application of
other remedies available to consumers under Union or national law.
▼B
Article 12
Courts and administrative authorities: substantiation of claims
Member States shall confer upon the courts or administrative authorities
powers enabling them in the civil or administrative proceedings
provided for in Article 11:
(a) to require the trader to furnish evidence as to the accuracy of factual
claims in relation to a commercial practice if, taking into account
the legitimate interest of the trader and any other party to the
proceedings, such a requirement appears appropriate on the basis
of the circumstances of the particular case;
and
(b) to consider factual claims as inaccurate if the evidence demanded in
accordance with (a) is not furnished or is deemed insufficient by the
court or administrative authority.
▼M1
Article 13
Penalties
1.
Member States shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to
infringements of national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive
and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are imple­
mented. The penalties provided for shall be effective, proportionate
and dissuasive.
2.
Member States shall ensure that the following non-exhaustive and
indicative criteria are taken into account for the imposition of penalties,
where appropriate:
(a) the nature, gravity, scale and duration of the infringement;
(b) any action taken by the trader to mitigate or remedy the damage
suffered by consumers;
(c) any previous infringements by the trader;
(d) the financial benefits gained or losses avoided by the trader due to
the infringement, if the relevant data are available;

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 12
▼M1
(e) penalties imposed on the trader for the same infringement in other
Member States in cross-border cases where information about such
penalties is available through the mechanism established by Regu­
lation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Coun­
cil (1);
(f) any other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to the circum­
stances of the case.
3.
Member States shall ensure that when penalties are to be imposed
in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, they
include the possibility either to impose fines through administrative
procedures or to initiate legal proceedings for the imposition of fines,
or both, the maximum amount of such fines being at least 4 % of the
trader’s annual turnover in the Member State or Member States
concerned. Without prejudice to that Regulation, Member States may,
for national constitutional reasons, restrict the imposition of fines to:
(a) infringements of Articles 6, 7, 8, 9 and of Annex I to this Directive;
and
(b) a trader’s continued use of a commercial practice that has been
found to be unfair by the competent national authority or court,
when that commercial practice is not an infringement referred to
in point (a).
For cases where a fine is to be imposed in accordance with
4.
paragraph 3, but information on the trader’s annual turnover is not
available, Member States shall introduce the possibility to impose
fines, the maximum amount of which shall be at least EUR 2 million.
5.
Member States shall, by 28 November 2021, notify the
Commission of the rules and measures referred to in paragraph 1 and
shall notify it, without delay, of any subsequent amendment affecting
them.

CONSIDERED UNFAIR

been approved, endorsed or authorised by a public or private body when

disclosing the existence of any reasonable grounds the trader may have
for believing that he will not be able to offer for supply or to procure
another trader to supply, those products or equivalent products at that
price for a period that is, and in quantities that are, reasonable having
regard to the product, the scale of advertising of the product and the
price offered (bait advertising).
6. Making an invitation to purchase products at a specified price and then:
(a) refusing to show the advertised item to consumers;
or
(b) refusing to take orders for it or deliver it within a reasonable time;
or
(c) demonstrating a defective sample of it,
with the intention of promoting a different product (bait and switch)
7. Falsely stating that a product will only be available for a very limited time,
or that it will only be available on particular terms for a very limited time,
in order to elicit an immediate decision and deprive consumers of sufficient
opportunity or time to make an informed choice.
8. Undertaking to provide after-sales service to consumers with whom the
trader has communicated prior to a transaction in a language which is
not an official language of the Member State where the trader is located
and then making such service available only in another language without
clearly disclosing this to the consumer before the consumer is committed to
the transaction.
9. Stating or otherwise creating the impression that a product can legally be
sold when it cannot.
10. Presenting rights given to consumers in law as a distinctive feature of the
trader's offer.

02005L0029 — EN — 28.05.2022 — 001.001 — 18
▼B
11. Using editorial content in the media to promote a product where a trader

the risk to the personal security of the consumer or his family if the
consumer does not purchase the product.

in such a manner as deliberately to mislead the consumer into believing that
the product is made by that same manufacturer when it is not.

a consumer gives consideration for the opportunity to receive compensation
that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the
scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products.

he is not.
16. Claiming that products are able to facilitate winning in games of chance.
17. Falsely claiming that a product is able to cure illnesses, dysfunction or

possibility of finding the product with the intention of inducing the
consumer to acquire the product at conditions less favourable than
normal market conditions.
19. Claiming in a commercial practice to offer a competition or prize promotion
without awarding the prizes described or a reasonable equivalent.

consumer has to pay anything other than the unavoidable cost of

delivery of the item.

payment which gives the consumer the impression that he has already
ordered the marketed product when he has not.

purposes relating to his trade, business, craft or profession, or falsely rep­
resenting oneself as a consumer.

23a. Reselling events tickets to consumers if the trader acquired them by using
automated means to circumvent any limit imposed on the number of tickets
that a person can buy or any other rules applicable to the purchase of
tickets.
23b. Stating that reviews of a product are submitted by consumers who have
actually used or purchased the product without taking reasonable and
proportionate steps to check that they originate from such consumers.
23c. Submitting or commissioning another legal or natural person to submit false
consumer reviews or endorsements, or misrepresenting consumer reviews or
social endorsements, in order to promote products.

▼B
Aggressive commercial practices
24. Creating the impression that the consumer cannot leave the premises until a
contract is formed.
25. Conducting personal visits to the consumer's home ignoring the consumer's
request to leave or not to return except in circumstances and to the extent
justified, under national law, to enforce a contractual obligation.
26. Making persistent and unwanted solicitations by telephone, fax, e-mail or
other remote media except in circumstances and to the extent justified

and 2002/58/EC.
27. Requiring a consumer who wishes to claim on an insurance policy to
produce documents which could not reasonably be considered relevant as

pertinent correspondence, in order to dissuade a consumer from exercising
his contractual rights.
28. Including in an advertisement a direct exhortation to children to buy
advertised products or persuade their parents or other adults to buy
advertised products for them. This provision is without prejudice to
Article 16 of Directive 89/552/EEC on television broadcasting.
29. Demanding immediate or deferred payment for or the return or safekeeping
of products supplied by the trader, but not solicited by the consumer except
where the product is a substitute supplied in conformity with Article 7(3) of
Directive 97/7/EC (inertia selling).
30. Explicitly informing a consumer that if he does not buy the product or
service, the trader's job or livelihood will be in jeopardy.
31. Creating the false impression that the consumer has already won, will win,
or will on doing a particular act win, a prize or other equivalent benefit,
when in fact either:
— there is no prize or other equivalent benefit,
or
— taking any action in relation to claiming the prize or other equivalent
benefit is subject to the consumer paying money or incurring a cost.
