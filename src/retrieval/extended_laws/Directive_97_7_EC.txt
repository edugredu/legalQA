DIRECTIVE 97 /7 / EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
COUNCIL

of 20 May 1997
on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF

THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,

Member States have already taken different or diver­
ging measures to protect consumers in respect of
distance selling, which has had a detrimental effect
on competition between businesses in the internal
market; whereas it is therefore necessary to introduce
at Community level a minimum set of common
rules in this area;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ('),

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social
Committee (2),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 189b of the Treaty (3), in the light of the joint text
approved by the Conciliation Committee on 27

(5) Whereas paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Annex to the
Council resolution of 14 April 1975 on a preliminary

programme of the European Economic Community
for a consumer protection and information policy (4)

or services from demands for payment for unsolicited
goods and from high-pressure selling methods;

could be one of the main tangible results of the

in this Directive, for a right of withdrawal from the

descriptions depending on the law of the Member
States; whereas the provisions of this Directive
cannot be applied differently according to the law of
the Member States, subject to their recourse to
Article 14; whereas, to that end, there is therefore

reason to consider that there must at least be compli­
ance with the provisions of this Directive at the time
of the first of a series of successive operations or the
first of a series of separate operations over a period of
time which may be considered as forming a whole,

Article 2

Definitions

For the purposes of this Directive :

( 1 ) 'distance contract' means any contract concerning
goods or services concluded between a supplier and a
consumer under an organized distance sales or ser­
vice-provision scheme run by the supplier, who, for
the purpose of the contract, makes exclusive use of

one or more means of distance communication up to
and including the moment at which the contract is
concluded;

(2) 'consumer' means any natural person who, in
contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for
purposes which are outside his trade, business or
profession;

(3) 'supplier' means any natural or legal person who, in

(Annex III);

contracts covered by this Directive, is acting in his
commercial or professional capacity;

(22) Whereas in the use of new technologies the
consumer is not in control of the means of commu­

nication used; whereas it is therefore necessary to
provide that the burden of proof may be on the
supplier;

(23) Whereas there is a risk that, in certain cases, the
consumer may be deprived of protection under this
Directive through the designation of the law of a
non-member country as the law applicable to the
contract; whereas provisions should therefore be

(4) 'means of distance communication' means any means
which, without the simultaneous physical presence of
the supplier and the consumer, may be used for the
conclusion of a contract between those parties. An
indicative list of the means covered by this Directive
is contained in Annex I;

(5) 'operator of a means of communication' means any
public or private natural or legal person whose trade,
business or profession involves making one or more
means

included in this Directive to avert that risk;

suppliers.

(24) Whereas a Member State may ban, in the general
interest, the marketing on its territory of certain
goods and services through distance contracts;
whereas that ban must comply with Community
rules; whereas there is already provision for such
bans, notably with regard to medicinal products,

commercial purpose of which must be made clear, shall
be provided in a clear and comprehensible manner in any
way appropriate to the means of distance communication
used, with due regard, in particular, to the principles of
good faith in commercial transactions, and the principles
governing the protection of those who are unable,
pursuant to the legislation of the Member States, to give
their consent, such as minors .

3 . Moreover, in the case of telephone communications,
the identity of the supplier and the commercial purpose
of the call shall be made explicitly clear at the beginning
of any conversation with the consumer.

Right of withdrawal
1 . For any distance contract the consumer shall have a
period of at least seven working days in which to with­
draw from the contract without penalty and without

giving any reason . The only charge that may be made to
the consumer because of the exercise of his right of with­
drawal is the direct cost of returning the goods.

The period for exercise of this right shall begin :
— in the case of goods, from the day of receipt by the
consumer where the obligations laid down in Article 5
have been fulfilled,

Article 5

Written confirmation of information

1.
The consumer must receive written confirmation or
confirmation in another durable medium available and

1.
If the information referred to in Article 5 is supplied
within this three-month period, the seven working day

period referred to in the first subparagraph shall begin as
from that moment .

2. Where the right of withdrawal has been exercised by
the consumer pursuant to this Article, the supplier shall
be obliged to reimburse the sums paid by the consumer
free of charge . The only charge that may be made to the
consumer because of the exercise of his right of with­
drawal is the direct cost of returning the goods. Such
reimbursement must be carried out as soon as possible
and in any case within 30 days.
3 . Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the
consumer may not exercise the right of withdrawal
provided for in paragraph 1 in respect of contracts :

— for the provision of services if performance has begun,
with the consumer's agreement, before the end of the
seven working day period referred to in paragraph 1 ,

Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the

supplier must execute the order within a maximum of 30

days from the day following that on which the consumer
forwarded his order to the supplier.
2. Where a supplier fails to perform his side of the
contract on the grounds that the goods or services ordered
are unavailable , the consumer must be informed of this

situation and must be able to obtain a refund of any sums
he has paid as soon as possible and in any case within 30
days.
3.
Nevertheless, Member States may lay down that the
supplier may provide the consumer with goods or services
of equivalent quality and price provided that this possibi­
lity was provided for prior to the conclusion of the
contract or in the contract. The consumer shall be

informed of this possibility in a clear and comprehensible
manner. The cost of returning the goods following exer­
cise of the right of withdrawal shall, in this case, be borne
by the supplier, and the consumer must be informed of
this. In such cases the supply of goods or services may not
be deemed to constitute inertia selling within the
meaning of Article 9 .

is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market
which cannot be controlled by the supplier,

Member States shall ensure that appropriate measures
exist to allow a consumer:

use has been made of his payment card in connection
with distance contracts covered by this Directive,

the sums paid or have them returned.
