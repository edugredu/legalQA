DIRECTIVE 98/6/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE
COUNCIL
of 16 February 1998
on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to
consumers
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF
THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European
Community, and in particular Article 129a(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1
),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social
Committee (2
),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 189b of the Treaty (3
), in the light of the joint text
approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December
1997,
(1) Whereas transparent operation of the market and
correct information is of benefit to consumer protection and healthy competition between enterprises
and products;
(2) Whereas consumers must be guaranteed a high level
of protection; whereas the Community should contribute thereto by specific action which supports and
supplements the policy pursued by the Member
States regarding precise, transparent and unambiguous information for consumers on the prices of
products offered to them;
(3) Whereas the Council Resolution of 14 April 1975 on
a preliminary programme of the European Economic
Community for a consumer protection and information policy (4
) and the Council Resolution of 19 May
1981 on a second programme of the European
Economic Community for a consumer protection
and information policy (5
) provide for the establishment of common principles for indicating prices;
(4) Whereas these principles have been established by
Directive 79/581/EEC concerning the indication of
prices of certain foodstuffs (6
) and Directive
88/314/EEC concerning the indication of prices of
non-food products (7
);
(5) Whereas the link between indication of the unit
price of products and their pre-packaging in preestablished quantities or capacities corresponding to
the values of the ranges adopted at Community level
has proved overly complex to apply; whereas it is
thus necessary to abandon this link in favour of a
new simplified mechanism and in the interest of the
consumer, without prejudice to the rules governing
packaging standardisation;
(6) Whereas the obligation to indicate the selling price
and the unit price contributes substantially to improving consumer information, as this is the easiest
way to enable consumers to evaluate and compare
the price of products in an optimum manner and
hence to make informed choices on the basis of
simple comparisons;
(7) Whereas, therefore, there should be a general obligation to indicate both the selling price and the unit
price for all products except for products sold in
bulk, where the selling price cannot be determined
until the consumer indicates how much of the
product is required;
(8) Whereas it is necessary to take into account the fact
that certain products are customarily sold in quantities different from one kilogramme, one litre, one
metre, one square metre or one cubic metre; whereas
it is thus appropriate to allow Member States to
authorise that the unit price refer to a different single
unit of quantity, taking into account the nature of
the product and the quantities in which it is customarily sold in the Member State concerned;
(9) Whereas the obligation to indicate the unit price
may entail an excessive burden for certain small
retail businesses under certain circumstances;
whereas Member States should therefore be allowed
to refrain from applying this obligation during an
appropriate transitional period;

(10) Whereas Member States should also remain free to
waive the obligation to indicate the unit price in the
case of products for which such price indication
would not be useful or would be liable to cause
confusion for instance when indication of the quantity is not relevant for price comparison purposes, or
when different products are marketed in the same
packaging;
(11) Whereas in the case of non-food products, Member
States, with a view to facilitating application of the
mechanism implemented, are free to draw up a list
of products or categories of products for which the
obligation to indicate the unit price remains applicable;
(12) Whereas Community-level rules can ensure homogenous and transparent information that will benefit
all consumers in the context of the internal market;
whereas the new, simplified approach is both necessary and sufficient to achieve this objective;
(13) Whereas Member States must make sure that the
system is effective; whereas the transparency of the
system should also be maintained when the euro is
introduced; whereas, to that end, the maximum
number of prices to be indicated should be limited;
(14) Whereas particular attention should be paid to small
retail businesses; whereas, to this end, the Commission should, in its report on the application of this
Directive to be presented no later than three years
after the date referred to in Article 11(1), take particular account of the experience gleaned in the application of the Directive by small retail businesses,
inter alia, regarding technological developments and
the introduction of the single currency; whereas this
report, having regard to the transitional period
referred to in Article 6, should be accompanied by a
proposal,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
The purpose of this Directive is to stipulate indication of
the selling price and the price per unit of measurement of
products offered by traders to consumers in order to
improve consumer information and to facilitate comparison of prices.
Article 2
For the purposes of this Directive:
(a) selling price shall mean the final price for a unit of the
product, or a given quantity of the product, including
VAT and all other taxes;
(b) unit price shall mean the final price, including VAT
and all other taxes, for one kilogramme, one litre, one
metre, one square metre or one cubic metre of the
product or a different single unit of quantity which is
widely and customarily used in the Member State
concerned in the marketing of specific products;
(c) products sold in bulk shall mean products which are
not pre-packaged and are measured in the presence of
the consumer;
(d) trader shall mean any natural or legal person who
sells or offers for sale products which fall within his
commercial or professional activity;
(e) consumer shall mean any natural person who buys a
product for purposes that do not fall within the sphere
of his commercial or professional activity.
Article 3
1. The selling price and the unit price shall be indicated for all products referred to in Article 1, the indication of the unit price being subject to the provisions of
Article 5. The unit price need not be indicated if it is
identical to the sales price.
2. Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 1
to:
— products supplied in the course of the provision of a
service,
— sales by auction and sales of works of art and antiques.
3. For products sold in bulk, only the unit price must
be indicated.
4. Any advertisement which mentions the selling price
of products referred to in Article 1 shall also indicate the
unit price subject to Article 5.
Article 4
1. The selling price and the unit price must be unambiguous, easily identifiable and clearly legible. Member
States may provide that the maximum number of prices
to be indicated be limited.
2. The unit price shall refer to a quantity declared in
accordance with national and Community provisions.
18. 3. 98 ¬ EN ¬ Official Journal of the European Communities L 80/29
Where national or Community provisions require the
indication of the net weight and the net drained weight
for certain pre-packed products, it shall be sufficient to
indicate the unit price of the net drained weight.
Article 5
1. Member States may waive the obligation to indicate
the unit price of products for which such indication
would not be useful because of the products’ nature or
purpose or would be liable to create confusion.
2. With a view to implementing paragraph 1, Member
States may, in the case of non-food products, establish a
list of the products or product categories to which the
obligation to indicate the unit price shall remain applicable.
Article 6
If the obligation to indicate the unit price were to constitute an excessive burden for certain small retail businesses
because of the number of products on sale, the sales area,
the nature of the place of sale, specific conditions of sale
where the product is not directly accessible for the
consumer or certain forms of business, such as certain
types of itinerant trade, Member States may, for a transitional period following the date referred to in Article 11
(1), provide that the obligation to indicate the unit price
of products other than those sold in bulk, which are sold
in the said businesses, shall not apply, subject to Article
12.
Article 7
Member States shall provide appropriate measures to
inform all persons concerned of the national law transposing this Directive.
Article 8
Member States shall lay down penalties for infringements
of national provisions adopted in application of this
Directive, and shall take all necessary measures to ensure
that these are enforced. These penalties must be effective,
proportionate and dissuasive.
Article 9
1. The transition period of nine years referred to in
Article 1 of Directive 95/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 November 1995

88/314/EEC on consumer protection in the indication of
the prices of non-food products (1
) shall be extended until

2. Directives 79/581/EEC and 88/314/EEC shall be
repealed with effect from the date referred to in Article 11
(1) of this Directive.
Article 10
This Directive shall not prevent Member States from
adopting or maintaining provisions which are more
favourable as regards consumer information and comparison of prices, without prejudice to their obligations
under the Treaty.
Article 11
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply
with this Directive not later than 18 March 2000. They
shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof. The
provisions adopted shall be applicable as of that date.
When Member States adopt these measures, they shall
contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official
publication. The methods of making such reference shall
be laid down by Member States.
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they
adopt in the field governed by this Directive.
3. Member States shall communicate the provisions
governing the penalties provided for in Article 8, and any
later amendments thereto.
