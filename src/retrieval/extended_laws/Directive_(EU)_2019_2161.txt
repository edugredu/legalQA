DIRECTIVES
DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2161 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 27 November 2019
amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU of the
European Parliament and of the Council as regards the better enforcement and modernisation of
Union consumer protection rules
(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1)

Article 169(1), and point (a) of Article 169(2), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
provide that the Union is to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection through measures
adopted pursuant to Article 114 TFEU. Article 38 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union
(‘the Charter’) provides that Union policies are to ensure a high level of consumer protection.

(2)

Consumer protection law should be applied effectively throughout the Union. Yet, the comprehensive Fitness Check
of consumer and marketing law carried out by the Commission in 2016 and 2017 in the framework of the
Regulatory Fitness and Performance (REFIT) programme concluded that the effectiveness of Union consumer
protection law is compromised by a lack of awareness among both traders and consumers and that existing means
of redress could be taken advantage of more often.

(3)

The Union has already taken a number of measures to improve awareness among consumers, traders and legal
practitioners about consumer rights and to improve enforcement of consumer rights and consumer redress.
However, there are remaining gaps in national law regarding truly effective and proportionate penalties to deter and
sanction intra-Union infringements, insufficient individual remedies for consumers harmed by breaches of national
legislation transposing Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and shortcomings
with regard to the injunction procedure under Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council (4). Revision of the injunction procedure should be addressed by a separate instrument amending and
replacing Directive 2009/22/EC.

(2) Position of the European Parliament of 17 April 2019 (not yet published in the Official Journal) and decision of the Council of

(3) Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer
commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and
2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of

Directives 98/6/EC (5), 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council include
requirements for Member States to provide for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to address
infringements of national provisions transposing those Directives. Furthermore, Article 21 of Regulation (EU)
2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) requires Member States to take enforcement
measures, including imposition of penalties, in an effective, efficient and coordinated manner to bring about the
cessation or prohibition of widespread infringements or widespread infringements with a Union dimension.

(5)

Current national rules on penalties differ significantly across the Union. In particular, not all Member States ensure
that effective, proportionate and dissuasive fines can be imposed on traders responsible for widespread
infringements or widespread infringements with a Union dimension. Therefore, the existing rules on penalties of
Directives 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU should be improved and, at the same time, new rules on
penalties in Council Directive 93/13/EEC (8) should be introduced.

(6)

It should remain a matter for the Member States to choose the types of penalty to be imposed and to lay down in
their national law the relevant procedures for the imposition of penalties in the event of infringements of Directives
93/13/EEC, 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU as amended by this Directive.

(7)

To facilitate more consistent application of penalties, in particular in the case of intra-Union infringements,
widespread infringements and widespread infringements with a Union dimension as defined in Regulation (EU)
2017/2394, common non-exhaustive and indicative criteria for the application of penalties should be included in
Directives 93/13/EEC, 98/6/EC, 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU. These criteria should include, for example, the
nature, gravity, scale and duration of the infringement, and any redress provided by the trader to consumers for the
harm caused. Repeated infringement by the same perpetrator shows a propensity to commit such infringements and
is therefore a significant indication of the gravity of the conduct and, accordingly, of the need to increase the level of
the penalty to achieve effective deterrence. The financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, due to the infringement
should be taken into account, if the relevant data are available. Other aggravating or mitigating factors applicable to
the circumstances of the case can also be taken into account.

(8)

Those common non-exhaustive and indicative criteria for the application of penalties might not be relevant in
deciding on penalties regarding every infringement, in particular regarding non-serious infringements. Member
States should also take account of other general principles of law applicable to the imposition of penalties, such as
the principle of non bis in idem.

(9)

In accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, Member States’ competent authorities concerned by
the coordinated action are to take within their jurisdiction all necessary enforcement measures against the trader
responsible for the widespread infringement or the widespread infringement with a Union dimension to bring
about the cessation or prohibition of that infringement. Where appropriate, they are to impose penalties, such as
fines or periodic penalty payments, on the trader responsible for the widespread infringement or the widespread
infringement with a Union dimension. Enforcement measures are to be taken in an effective, efficient and
coordinated manner to bring about the cessation or prohibition of the widespread infringement or the widespread
infringement with a Union dimension. The competent authorities concerned by the coordinated action are to seek
to take enforcement measures simultaneously in the Member States concerned by that infringement.

(10)

To ensure that Member States’ authorities can impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in relation to
widespread infringements and to widespread infringements with a Union dimension that are subject to coordinated
investigation and enforcement measures in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, fines should be introduced
as an element of penalties for such infringements. In order to ensure that the fines have a deterrent effect, Member

(5) Directive 98/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 on consumer protection in the indication of the
prices of products offered to consumers (OJ L 80, 18.3.1998, p. 27).
(6) Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on consumer rights, amending Council
Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive
85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 304, 22.11.2011, p. 64).
(7) Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 on cooperation between national
authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 (OJ L 345,
27.12.2017, p. 1).
(8) Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p. 29).

States should set in their national law the maximum fine for such infringements at a level that is at least 4 % of the
trader’s annual turnover in the Member State or Member States concerned. In certain cases, a trader can also be a
group of companies.

(11)

As laid down in Articles 9 and 10 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, when imposing penalties due regard should be
given, as appropriate, to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement in question. The imposition of
penalties should be proportionate and should comply with Union and national law, including with applicable
procedural safeguards and with the principles of the Charter. Finally, the penalties imposed should be appropriate to
the nature and the overall actual or potential harm of the infringement of Union laws that protect consumers’
interests. The power to impose penalties is to be exercised either directly by competent authorities under their own
authority, or, where appropriate, by recourse to other competent authorities or other public authorities, or by
instructing designated bodies, if applicable, or by application to courts competent to grant the necessary decision,
including, where appropriate, by appeal, if the application to grant the necessary decision is not successful.

(12)

Where, as a result of the coordinated action under Regulation (EU) 2017/2394, a single competent authority within
the meaning of that Regulation imposes a fine on the trader responsible for the widespread infringement or the
widespread infringement with a Union dimension, it should be able to impose a fine of at least 4 % of the trader’s
annual turnover in all Member States concerned by the coordinated enforcement action.

(13)

Member States should not be prevented from maintaining or introducing in their national law higher maximum
turnover-based fines for widespread infringements and widespread infringements with a Union dimension. It
should also be possible for Member States to base such fines on the trader’s worldwide turnover, or to extend the
rules on fines to other infringements not covered by provisions of this Directive related to Article 21 of Regulation
(EU) 2017/2394. The requirement to set the fine at a level of not less than 4 % of the trader’s annual turnover
should not apply to any additional Member State rules on periodic penalty payments, such as daily fines, for noncompliance with any decision, order, interim measure, trader’s commitment or other measure with the aim of
bringing to an end the infringement.

(14)

Rules on penalties should be included in Directive 93/13/EEC with a view to strengthening its deterrent effect.
Member States are free to decide on the administrative or judicial procedure for the application of penalties for
infringements of that Directive. In particular, administrative authorities or national courts could impose penalties
when establishing the unfair character of contractual terms, including on the basis of legal proceedings initiated by
an administrative authority. The penalties could also be imposed by administrative authorities or national courts
when the seller or supplier uses contractual terms which are expressly defined as unfair in all circumstances in
national law as well as when the seller or supplier uses contractual terms which have been found to be unfair by a
final binding decision. Member States could decide that administrative authorities also have the right to establish
the unfair character of contractual terms. Administrative authorities or national courts could also impose a penalty
through the same decision by which unfairness of contractual terms is established. Member States could lay down
the appropriate coordination mechanisms for actions at national level regarding individual redress and penalties.

(15)

When allocating revenues from fines, Member States should consider enhancing the protection of the general
interest of consumers as well as other protected public interests.

(16)

Member States should ensure that remedies are available for consumers harmed by unfair commercial practices in
order to eliminate all the effects of those unfair practices. A clear framework for individual remedies would facilitate
private enforcement. The consumer should have access to compensation for damage and, where relevant, a price
reduction or termination of the contract, in a proportionate and effective manner. Member States should not be
prevented from maintaining or introducing rights to other remedies such as repair or replacement for consumers
harmed by unfair commercial practices in order to ensure full removal of the effects of such practices. Member
States should not be prevented from determining conditions for the application and effects of remedies for
consumers. When applying the remedies, the gravity and nature of the unfair commercial practice, damage suffered
by the consumer and other relevant circumstances, such as the trader’s misconduct or the infringement of the
contract, could be taken into account, where appropriate.

The Fitness Check of consumer and marketing law and the parallel evaluation of Directive 2011/83/EU also
identified a number of areas where the existing Union consumer protection rules should be modernised. In view of
the continuous development of digital tools, adjustment of Union consumer protection law is necessary.

(18)

Higher ranking or any prominent placement of commercial offers within online search results by the providers of
online search functionality has an important impact on consumers.

(19)

Ranking refers to the relative prominence of the offers of traders or the relevance given to search results as presented,
organised or communicated by providers of online search functionality, including resulting from the use of
algorithmic sequencing, rating or review mechanisms, visual highlights, or other saliency tools, or combinations
thereof.

(20)

In this regard, Annex I to Directive 2005/29/EC should be amended in order to make it clear that practices where a
trader provides information to a consumer in the form of search results in response to the consumer’s online search
query without clearly disclosing any paid advertising or payment specifically for achieving higher ranking of
products within the search results should be prohibited. When a trader has directly or indirectly paid the provider of
the online search functionality for a higher ranking of a product within the search results, the provider of the online
search functionality should inform consumers of that fact in a concise, easily accessible and intelligible form. Indirect
payment could be in the form of the acceptance by a trader of additional obligations towards the provider of the
online search functionality of any kind which have higher ranking as its specific effect. The indirect payment could
consist of increased commission per transaction as well as different compensation schemes that specifically lead to
higher ranking. Payments for general services, such as listing fees or membership subscriptions, which address a
broad range of functionalities offered by the provider of the online search functionality to the trader, should not be
considered to be a payment for specifically achieving higher ranking of products, provided that such payments are
not dedicated to achieving higher ranking. Online search functionality can be provided by different types of online
trader, including intermediaries, such as online marketplaces, search engines and comparison websites.

(21)

Transparency requirements with regard to the main parameters determining ranking are also regulated by Regulation
(EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council (9). The transparency requirements under that
Regulation cover a broad range of online intermediaries, including online marketplaces, but they only apply
between traders and online intermediaries. Similar transparency requirements should therefore be introduced in
Directive 2005/29/EC to ensure adequate transparency towards the consumers, except in the case of providers of
online search engines, which are already required by that Regulation to set out the main parameters which
individually or collectively are most significant in determining ranking and the relative importance of those main
parameters, by providing an easily and publicly available description, drafted in plain and intelligible language on
the online search engines of those providers.

(22)

Traders enabling consumers to search for goods and services, such as travel, accommodation and leisure activities,
offered by different traders or by consumers should inform consumers about the default main parameters
determining the ranking of offers presented to the consumer as a result of the search query and their relative
importance as opposed to other parameters. That information should be succinct and made easily, prominently and
directly available. Parameters determining the ranking mean any general criteria, processes, specific signals
incorporated into algorithms or other adjustment or demotion mechanisms used in connection with the ranking.

(23)

The information requirement regarding the main parameters determining the ranking is without prejudice to
Directive (EU) 2016/943 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). Traders should not be required to
disclose the detailed functioning of their ranking mechanisms, including algorithms. Traders should provide a
general description of the main parameters determining the ranking that explains the default main parameters used
by the trader and their relative importance as opposed to other parameters, but that description does not have to be
presented in a customised manner for each individual search query.

Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency
for business users of online intermediation services (OJ L 186, 11.7.2019, p. 57).

and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure (OJ L 157, 15.6.2016, p. 1).

(24)

When products are offered to consumers in online marketplaces, both the provider of the online marketplace and
the third-party supplier are involved in the provision of the pre-contractual information required by Directive
2011/83/EU. As a result, consumers using the online marketplace may not clearly understand who their contractual
partners are and how their rights and obligations are affected.

(25)

Online marketplaces should be defined for the purposes of Directives 2005/29/EC and 2011/83/EU in a similar
manner as in Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) and Directive (EU)
2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12). However, the definition of ‘online marketplace’
should be updated and rendered more technologically neutral in order to cover new technologies. It is therefore
appropriate to refer, instead of to a ‘website’, to software, including a website, part of a website or an application,
operated by or on behalf of the trader, in accordance with the notion of an ‘online interface’ as provided by
Regulation (EU) 2017/2394 and Regulation (EU) 2018/302 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13).

(26)

Specific information requirements for online marketplaces should therefore be provided in Directives 2005/29/EC
and 2011/83/EU to inform consumers using online marketplaces about the main parameters determining the
ranking of offers, and whether they enter into a contract with a trader or a non-trader, such as another consumer.

(27)

Providers of online marketplaces should inform consumers whether the third party offering goods, services or digital
content is a trader or non-trader, based on the declaration made to them by the third party. When the third party
offering the goods, services or digital content declares its status to be that of a non-trader, providers of online
marketplaces should provide a short statement to the effect that the consumer rights stemming from Union
consumer protection law do not apply to the contract concluded. Furthermore, consumers should be informed of
how obligations related to the contract are shared between third parties offering the goods, services or digital
content and providers of online marketplaces. The information should be provided in a clear and comprehensible
manner and not merely in the standard terms and conditions or similar contractual documents. The information
requirements for providers of online marketplaces should be proportionate. Those requirements need to strike a
balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of providers of online marketplaces.
Providers of online marketplaces should not be required to list specific consumer rights when informing consumers
about their non-applicability. This is without prejudice to the consumer information requirements provided for in
Directive 2011/83/EU, and in particular in Article 6(1) thereof. The information to be provided about the
responsibility for ensuring consumer rights depends on the contractual arrangements between the providers of
online marketplaces and the relevant third-party traders. The provider of the online marketplace could indicate that
a third-party trader is solely responsible for ensuring consumer rights, or describe its own specific responsibilities
where that provider assumes responsibility for certain aspects of the contract, for example, delivery or the exercise
of the right of withdrawal.

(28)

In accordance with Article 15(1) of Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14),
providers of online marketplaces should not be required to verify the legal status of third-party suppliers. Instead,
providers of online marketplaces should require third-party suppliers on the online marketplace to indicate their
status as traders or non-traders for the purposes of consumer protection law and to provide this information to the
provider of online marketplace.

(29)

Taking into account the rapid technological developments concerning online marketplaces and the need to ensure a
high level of consumer protection, Member States should be able to adopt or maintain specific additional measures
for that purpose. Such provisions should be proportionate, non-discriminatory and without prejudice to Directive
2000/31/EC.

(11) Regulation (EU) No 524/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2013 on online dispute resolution for
consumer disputes and amending Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC (Regulation on consumer ODR) (OJ
L 165, 18.6.2013, p. 1).
(12) Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 concerning measures for a high common
level of security of network and information systems across the Union (OJ L 194, 19.7.2016, p. 1).
(13) Regulation (EU) 2018/302 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 February 2018 on addressing unjustified geoblocking and other forms of discrimination based on customers’ nationality, place of residence or place of establishment within the
internal market and amending Regulations (EC) No 2006/2004 and (EU) No 2017/2394 and Directive 2009/22/EC (OJ L 60 I,
2.3.2018, p. 1).
(14) Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society
services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (‘Directive on electronic commerce’) (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1).

(30)

The definitions of digital content and digital services in Directive 2011/83/EU should be aligned to those in Directive (EU)
2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15). Digital content covered by Directive (EU) 2019/770 covers
a single act of supply, a series of individual acts of supply, or continuous supply over a period of time. The element of
continuous supply should not necessarily require a long-term supply. Cases such as web-streaming of video clips should
be considered continuous supply over a period of time, regardless of the actual duration of the audiovisual file. It may
therefore be difficult to distinguish between certain types of digital content and digital services, since both can involve
continuous supply by the trader over the duration of the contract. Examples of digital services are video and audio
sharing services and other file hosting, word processing or games offered in the cloud, cloud storage, webmail, social
media and cloud applications. The continuous involvement of the service provider justifies the application of the rules
on the right of withdrawal provided for in Directive 2011/83/EU that effectively allow the consumer to test the service
and decide, during the 14-day period from the conclusion of the contract, whether to keep it or not. Many contracts for
the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium are characterised by a single act of supply to the
consumer of a specific piece or pieces of digital content, such as specific music or video files. Contracts for the supply of
digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium remain subject to the exception from the right of withdrawal
set out in point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of Directive 2011/83/EU, which provides that the consumer loses
the right of withdrawal when the performance of the contract is started, such as download or streaming of the content,
subject to the consumer’s prior express consent to begin the performance during the right of withdrawal period and
acknowledgement that he has thereby lost his right of withdrawal. Where there is doubt as to whether the contract is a
service contract or a contract for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, the rules on
right of withdrawal for services should apply.

(31)

Digital content and digital services are often supplied online under contracts under which the consumer does not
pay a price but provides personal data to the trader. Directive 2011/83/EU already applies to contracts for the
supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium (i.e. supply of online digital content) regardless
of whether the consumer pays a price in money or provides personal data. However, that Directive only applies to
service contracts, including contracts for digital services, under which the consumer pays or undertakes to pay a
price. Consequently, that Directive does not apply to contracts for digital services under which the consumer
provides personal data to the trader without paying a price. Given their similarities and the interchangeability of
paid digital services and digital services provided in exchange for personal data, they should be subject to the same
rules under that Directive.

(32)

Consistency should be ensured between the scope of application of Directive 2011/83/EU and Directive (EU)
2019/770, which applies to contracts for the supply of digital content or digital services under which the consumer
provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader.

(33)

Therefore, the scope of Directive 2011/83/EU should be extended to cover also contracts under which the trader supplies
or undertakes to supply a digital service to the consumer, and the consumer provides or undertakes to provide personal
data. Similar to contracts for the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium, that Directive
should apply whenever the consumer provides or undertakes to provide personal data to the trader, except where the
personal data provided by the consumer are exclusively processed by the trader for the purpose of supplying the digital
content or digital service, and the trader does not process those data for any other purpose. Any processing of personal
data should comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (16).

(34)

In order to ensure full alignment with Directive (EU) 2019/770, where digital content and digital services are not
supplied in exchange for a price, Directive 2011/83/EU should also not apply to situations where the trader collects
personal data for the sole purpose of meeting legal requirements to which the trader is subject. Such situations can
include, for instance, cases where the registration of the consumer is required by applicable laws for security and
identification purposes.

(15) Directive (EU) 2019/770 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for
the supply of digital content and digital services (OJ L 136, 22.5.2019, p. 1).
(16) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data
Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).

18.12.2019

L 328/13

(35)

Directive 2011/83/EU should also not apply to situations where the trader only collects metadata, such as
information concerning the consumer’s device or browsing history, except where this situation is considered to be a
contract under national law. It should also not apply to situations where the consumer, without having concluded a
contract with the trader, is exposed to advertisements exclusively in order to gain access to digital content or a digital
service. However, Member States should remain free to extend the application of that Directive to such situations, or
to otherwise regulate such situations, which are excluded from the scope of that Directive.

(36)

The notion of functionality should be understood to refer to the ways in which digital content or a digital service can
be used. For instance, the absence or presence of any technical restrictions such as protection via Digital Rights
Management or region coding could have an impact on the ability of the digital content or digital service to
perform all its functions having regard to its purpose. The notion of interoperability relates to whether and to what
extent digital content or a digital service is able to function with hardware or software that is different from those
with which digital content or digital services of the same type are normally used. Successful functioning could
include, for instance, the ability of the digital content or digital service to exchange information with such other
software or hardware and to use the information exchanged. The notion of compatibility is defined in Directive (EU)
2019/770.

(37)

Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) of Directive 2011/83/EU require traders, for off-premises and distance contracts
respectively, to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent to begin performance before the expiry of the right of
withdrawal period. Point (a) of Article 14(4) of that Directive provides for a contractual sanction when this
requirement is not fulfilled by the trader, namely that the consumer does not have to pay for the services provided.
The requirement to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent is accordingly only relevant for services, including
digital services, which are provided against the payment of the price. It is therefore necessary to amend Article 7(3)
and Article 8(8) to the effect that the requirement for traders to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent only
applies to service contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay.

(38)

Point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of Directive 2011/83/EU provides for an exception to the right of
withdrawal in respect of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the consumer has given prior
express consent to begin the performance before the expiry of the right of withdrawal period and acknowledged that
he thereby loses his right of withdrawal. Point (b) of Article 14(4) of that Directive provides for a contractual
sanction when this requirement is not fulfilled by the trader, namely, the consumer does not have to pay for the
digital content consumed. The requirement to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgment is
accordingly only relevant for digital content which is provided against the payment of the price. It is therefore
necessary to amend point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 to the effect that the requirement for traders to
obtain the consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgment only applies to contracts that place the
consumer under an obligation to pay.

(39)

Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC sets out information requirements for the invitation to purchase a product at a
specific price. Those information requirements apply already at the advertising stage, whilst Directive 2011/83/EU
imposes the same and other, more detailed information requirements at the later pre-contractual stage (i.e. just
before the consumer enters into a contract). Consequently, traders may be required to provide the same information
at the advertising stage (e.g. an online advertisement on a media website) and at the pre-contractual stage (e.g. on the
pages of their online web-shops).

(40)

The information requirements under Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29/EC include informing the consumer about
the trader’s complaint handling policy. The Fitness Check of consumer and marketing law findings show that that
information is most relevant at the pre-contractual stage, which is regulated by Directive 2011/83/EU. The
requirement to provide that information in invitations to purchase at the advertising stage under Directive
2005/29/EC should therefore be deleted.

(41)

Point (h) of Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/83/EU requires traders to provide consumers with pre-contractual
information about the right of withdrawal, including the model withdrawal form set out in Annex I(B) to that
Directive. Article 8(4) of that Directive provides for simpler pre-contractual information requirements if the
contract is concluded through a means of distance communication which allows limited space or time to display
the information, such as over the telephone, via voice operated shopping assistants or by SMS. The mandatory precontractual information to be provided on or through that particular means of distance communication includes
information regarding the right of withdrawal as referred to in point (h) of Article 6(1). Accordingly, it also includes
the provision of the model withdrawal form set out in Annex I(B). However, the provision of the withdrawal form is

L 328/14

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

18.12.2019

impossible when the contract is concluded by means such as telephone or voice operated shopping assistant and it
may not be technically feasible in a user-friendly way on other means of distance communication covered by Article
8(4). It is therefore appropriate to exclude the provision of the model withdrawal form from the information that
traders have to provide in any case on or through the particular means of distance communication used for the
conclusion of the contract under Article 8(4).

(42)

Point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of Directive 2011/83/EU provides for an exception from the right of
withdrawal regarding service contracts that have been fully performed if the performance has begun with the
consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgement that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract
has been fully performed by the trader. In contrast, Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) of that Directive, which deal with
the trader’s obligations in situations where the performance of the contract has begun before the expiry of the right
of withdrawal period, only require traders to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent but not acknowledgment
that the right of withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed. To ensure consistency between those
provisions, it is necessary to add an obligation in Article 7(3) and Article 8(8) for the trader also to obtain the
acknowledgement from the consumer that the right of withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed,
if the contract places the consumer under an obligation to pay. In addition, the wording of point (a) of the first
paragraph of Article 16 should be amended to take into account the changes to Article 7(3) and Article 8(8)
whereby the requirement for traders to obtain the consumer’s prior express consent and acknowledgment only
applies to service contracts that place the consumer under an obligation to pay. However, Member States should be
given the option not to apply the requirement to obtain the consumer’s acknowledgment that the right of
withdrawal will be lost when the performance is completed to service contracts where the consumer has specifically
requested a visit from the trader for the purpose of carrying out repairs. Point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 16
of that Directive provides for an exception to the right of withdrawal in respect of contracts regarding the supply of
goods made to the consumer’s specifications or clearly personalised. That exception covers, for example, the
manufacturing and installation of customised furniture at the consumer’s home when provided under a single sales
contract.

(43)

The exception from the right of withdrawal provided in point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 16 of Directive
2011/83/EU, should also be considered to apply to contracts for individual deliveries of non-network energy,
because its price is dependent on fluctuations in the commodity markets or energy markets which cannot be
controlled by the trader and which may occur within the withdrawal period.

(44)

Article 14(4) of Directive 2011/83/EU stipulates the conditions under which, in the event of exercising the right of
withdrawal, the consumer does not bear the cost for the performance of services, supply of public utilities and
supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium. When any of those conditions is met, the
consumer does not have to pay the price of the service, public utilities or digital content received before the exercise
of the right of withdrawal. As regards digital content, one of those non-cumulative conditions, namely under point
(b)(iii) of Article 14(4), is a failure to provide the confirmation of the contract, which includes confirmation of the
consumer’s prior express consent to begin the performance of the contract before the expiry of the right of
withdrawal period and acknowledgement that the right of withdrawal is lost as a result. However, that condition is
not included among the conditions for the loss of the right of withdrawal in point (m) of the first paragraph of
Article 16 of that Directive, creating uncertainty as regards the possibility for consumers to invoke point (b)(iii) of
Article 14(4) when the other two conditions provided for in point (b) of Article 14(4) are met and, as a result, the
right of withdrawal is lost in accordance with point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16. The condition provided
for in point (b)(iii) of Article 14(4) should therefore be added to point (m) of the first paragraph of Article 16 to
enable the consumer to exercise the right of withdrawal when that condition is not met and accordingly claim the
rights provided for in Article 14(4).

(45)

Traders may personalise the price of their offers for specific consumers or specific categories of consumer based on
automated decision-making and profiling of consumer behaviour allowing traders to assess the consumer’s
purchasing power. Consumers should therefore be clearly informed when the price presented to them is
personalised on the basis of automated decision-making, so that they can take into account the potential risks in
their purchasing decision. Consequently, a specific information requirement should be added to Directive
2011/83/EU to inform the consumer when the price is personalised, on the basis of automated decision-making.
This information requirement should not apply to techniques such as ‘dynamic’ or ‘real-time’ pricing that involve

18.12.2019

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

L 328/15

changing the price in a highly flexible and quick manner in response to market demands when those techniques do
not involve personalisation based on automated decision-making. This information requirement is without prejudice
to Regulation (EU) 2016/679, which provides, inter alia, for the right of the individual not to be subjected to
automated individual decision-making, including profiling.
(46)

Considering technological developments, it is necessary to remove the reference to fax number from the list of the
means of communication in point (c) of Article 6(1) of Directive 2011/83/EU since fax is rarely used now and
largely obsolete.

(47)

Consumers increasingly rely on consumer reviews and endorsements when they make purchasing decisions.
Therefore, when traders provide access to consumer reviews of products, they should inform consumers whether
processes or procedures are in place to ensure that the published reviews originate from consumers who have
actually used or purchased the products. If such processes or procedures are in place, traders should provide
information on how the checks are made and provide clear information to consumers on how reviews are
processed, for example, if all reviews, either positive or negative, are posted or whether those reviews have been
sponsored or influenced by a contractual relationship with a trader. Moreover, it should therefore be considered to
be an unfair commercial practice to mislead consumers by stating that reviews of a product were submitted by
consumers who actually used or purchased that product when no reasonable and proportionate steps were taken to
ensure that they originate from such consumers. Such steps could include technical means to verify the reliability of
the person posting a review, for example by requesting information to verify that the consumer has actually used or
purchased the product.

(48)

The provisions of this Directive addressing consumer reviews and endorsements are without prejudice to the
common and legitimate advertising practice of making exaggerated statements or statements which are not meant
to be taken literally.

(49)

Traders should also be prohibited from submitting fake consumer reviews and endorsements, such as ‘likes’ on social
media, or commissioning others to do so in order to promote their products, as well as from manipulating
consumer reviews and endorsements, such as publishing only positive reviews and deleting the negative ones. Such
practice could also occur through the extrapolation of social endorsements, where a user’s positive interaction with
certain online content is linked or transferred to different but related content, creating the appearance that that user
also takes a positive stance towards the related content.

(50)

Traders should be prohibited from reselling to consumers tickets to cultural and sports events that they have
acquired by using software such as ‘bots’ enabling them to buy tickets in excess of the technical limits imposed by
the primary ticket seller or to bypass any other technical means put in place by the primary seller to ensure
accessibility of tickets for all individuals. That prohibition is without prejudice to any other national measures that
Member States can take to protect the legitimate interests of consumers and to secure cultural policy and broad
access of all individuals to cultural and sports events, such as regulating the resale price of the tickets.

(51)

Article 16 of the Charter guarantees the freedom to conduct a business in accordance with Union law and national
laws and practices. However, marketing across Member States of goods as being identical when, in reality, they have
a significantly different composition or characteristics may mislead consumers and cause them to take a
transactional decision that they would not have taken otherwise.

(52)

Such a practice can therefore be regarded as contrary to Directive 2005/29/EC based on a case-by-case assessment of
relevant elements. In order to facilitate the application of existing Union law by Member States’ consumer and food
authorities, guidance on the application of current Union rules to situations of dual quality of food was provided in
the Commission Notice of 29 September 2017 ‘on the application of EU food and consumer protection law to issues
of Dual Quality of products – The specific case of food’. In this context, the Commission’s Joint Research Centre
presented, on 25 April 2018, a ‘Framework for selecting and testing of food products to assess quality related
characteristics: EU harmonised testing methodology’.

(53)

However, in the absence of an explicit provision, the enforcement experience has shown that it might be unclear to
consumers, traders and national competent authorities which commercial practices could be contrary to Directive
2005/29/EC. Therefore, that Directive should be amended to ensure legal certainty for both traders and
enforcement authorities by addressing explicitly the marketing of a good as being identical to a good marketed in

L 328/16

EN

Official Journal of the European Union

18.12.2019

other Member States, where that good has significantly different composition or characteristics. Competent
authorities should assess and address on a case- by-case basis such practices in accordance with Directive
2005/29/EC, as amended by this Directive. In undertaking its assessment the competent authority should take into
account whether such differentiation is easily identifiable by consumers, a trader’s right to adapt goods of the same
brand for different geographical markets due to legitimate and objective factors, such as national law, availability or
seasonality of raw materials or voluntary strategies to improve access to healthy and nutritious food as well as the
traders’ right to offer goods of the same brand in packages of different weight or volume in different geographical
markets. The competent authorities should assess whether such differentiation is easily identifiable by consumers by
looking at the availability and adequacy of information. It is important that consumers are informed about the
differentiation of goods due to legitimate and objective factors. Traders should be free to provide such information
in different ways that allow consumers to access the necessary information. Alternatives to providing information
on the label of goods should generally be preferred by traders. The relevant Union sectorial rules and rules on free
movement of goods should be respected.

(54)

While off-premises sales constitute a legitimate and well-established sales channel, like sales at a trader’s business
premises and distance–selling, some particularly aggressive or misleading marketing or selling practices in the
context of visits to a consumer’s home or excursions as referred to in point (8) of Article 2 of Directive 2011/83/EU
can put consumers under pressure to make purchases of goods or services that they would not otherwise buy or
purchases at excessive prices, often involving immediate payment. Such practices often target elderly or other
vulnerable consumers. Some Member States consider those practices undesirable and deem it necessary to restrict
certain forms and aspects of off-premises sales within the meaning of Directive 2011/83/EU, such as aggressive and
misleading marketing or selling of a product in the context of unsolicited visits to a consumer’s home or excursions.
Where such restrictions are adopted on grounds other than consumer protection, such as public interest or the
respect for consumers’ private life protected by Article 7 of the Charter, they fall outside the scope of Directive
2005/29/EC.

(55)

In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and in order to facilitate enforcement, it should be clarified that
Directive 2005/29/EC is without prejudice to Member States’ freedom to adopt national provisions to further
protect the legitimate interests of consumers against unfair commercial practices in the context of unsolicited visits
at their homes by a trader in order to offer or sell products or excursions organised by a trader with the aim or
effect of promoting or selling products to consumers where such provisions are justified on grounds of consumer
protection. Any such provisions should be proportionate and non-discriminatory and should not prohibit those
sales channels as such. National provisions adopted by Member States could, for example, define time of the day
when visits to consumers’ homes without their express request are not allowed or prohibit such visits when the
consumer has visibly indicated that such visits are not acceptable or prescribe the payment procedure. Furthermore,
such provisions could lay down more protective rules in the areas harmonised by Directive 2011/83/EU. Directive
2011/83/EU should therefore be amended to allow Member States to adopt national measures to provide a longer
period for the right of withdrawal and to derogate from specific exceptions from the right of withdrawal. Member
States should be required to notify any national provisions adopted in this regard to the Commission so that the
Commission can make this information available to all interested parties and monitor the proportionate nature and
legality of those measures.

(56)

As regards aggressive and misleading practices in the context of events organised at places other than trader’s
premises, Directive 2005/29/EC is without prejudice to any conditions of establishment or of authorisation regimes
that Member States can impose on traders. Furthermore, that Directive is without prejudice to national contract law,
and in particular to the rules on validity, formation or effect of a contract. Aggressive and misleading practices in the
context of events organised at places other than trader’s premises can be prohibited on the basis of a case-by-case
assessment under Articles 5 to 9 of that Directive. In addition, Annex I to that Directive contains a general
prohibition of practices where the trader creates the impression that the trader is not acting for purposes relating to
the trader’s profession, and practices that create the impression that the consumer cannot leave the premises until a
contract is formed. The Commission should assess whether the current rules provide an adequate level of consumer
protection and adequate tools for Member States to effectively address such practices.

(57)

This Directive should not affect aspects of national contract law that are not regulated by it. Therefore, this Directive
should be without prejudice to national contract law regulating for instance the conclusion or the validity of a
contract in cases such as lack of consent or unauthorised commercial activity.

(58)

In order to ensure that citizens have access to up-to-date information on their consumer rights and on out-of-court
dispute resolution, the online entry point to be developed by the Commission should, as far as possible, be userfriendly, mobile-responsive, easily accessible and usable by all, including persons with disabilities (‘design for all’).

(59)

In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on
explanatory documents (17), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of
their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a
directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments. With regard to this Directive, the
legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified.

(60)

Since the objectives of this Directive, namely better enforcement and modernisation of consumer protection law,
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the Union-wide character of the
problem, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of
subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of
proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve
those objectives,

HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
