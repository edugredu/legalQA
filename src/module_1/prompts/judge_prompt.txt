You are a legal expert assigned to evaluate the quality of a final answer provided by an automated legal assistant.

The assistant received only:
- The user's original legal question, written in natural language.

You are given:
- The user’s question: \"\"\"{initial_query}\"\"\"
- The assistant’s final answer: \"\"\"{llm_output}\"\"\"

Your task is to assess how well the answer fulfills its purpose of informing and assisting the user with their legal issue. You do not have access to the laws, and the assistant didn’t either—so base your judgment on general legal reasoning and communication quality.

For each criterion below, assign a score from 0 (very poor) to 5 (excellent):

- Relevance: Does the answer directly address the user's question?
- Completeness: Are all key aspects of the legal issue reasonably covered (e.g., rights, obligations, remedies)?
- Clarity: Is the answer clearly written and understandable to a non-expert?
- Accuracy: Is the information legally plausible and free of obvious errors or misleading claims?
- Justification: Does the answer explain why each legal point or suggestion is relevant to the user's situation?

Please provide your evaluation in the following JSON format:

{{
  "relevance": (integer 0-5),
  "completeness": (integer 0-5),
  "clarity": (integer 0-5),
  "accuracy": (integer 0-5),
  "justification": (integer 0-5),
  "explanation": "(A brief justification of your scores in 2-4 sentences)"
