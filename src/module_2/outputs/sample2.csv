THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 26(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that a transfer of personal data to a third country may only take place if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of data protection and the Member States' laws, which comply with the other provisions of the Directive, are respected prior to the transfer.
(2) However, Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC provides that Member States may authorise, subject to certain safeguards, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection. Such safeguards may in particular result from appropriate contractual clauses.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer operation or set of data transfer operations. The Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under that Directive(2) has issued guidelines to aid with the assessment(3).
(4) The standard contractual clauses relate only to data protection. The data exporter and the data importer are free to include any other clauses on business related issues which they consider as being pertinent for the contract as long as they do not contradict the standard contractual clauses.
(5) This Decision should be without prejudice to national authorisations Member States may grant in accordance with national provisions implementing Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC. This Decision only has the effect of requiring the Member States not to refuse to recognise as providing adequate safeguards the contractual clauses set out in it and does not therefore have any effect on other contractual clauses.
(6) The scope of this Decision is limited to establishing that the clauses which it sets out may be used by a data controller established in the Community in order to adduce adequate safeguards within the meaning of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to a processor established in a third country.
(7) This Decision should implement the obligation provided for in Article 17(3) of Directive 95/46/EC and does not prejudice the content of the contracts or legal acts established pursuant to that provision. However, some of the standard contractual clauses, in particular as regards the data exporter's obligations, should be included in order to increase clarity as to the provisions which may be contained in a contract between a controller and a processor.
(8) Supervisory authorities of the Member States play a key role in this contractual mechanism in ensuring that personal data are adequately protected after the transfer. In exceptional cases where data exporters refuse or are unable to instruct the data importer properly, with an imminent risk of grave harm to the data subjects, the standard contractual clauses should allow the supervisory authorities to audit data importers and, where appropriate, take decisions which are binding on data importers. The supervisory authorities should have the power to prohibit or suspend a data transfer or a set of transfers based on the standard contractual clauses in those exceptional cases where it is established that a transfer on contractual basis is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations providing adequate protection for the data subject.
(9) The Commission may also consider in the future whether standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to data processors established in third countries not offering an adequate level of data protection, submitted by business organisations or other interested parties, offer adequate safeguards in accordance with Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC.
(10) A disclosure of personal data to a data processor established outside the Community is an international transfer protected under Chapter IV of Directive 95/46/EC. Consequently, this Decision does not cover the transfer of personal data by controllers established in the Community to controllers established outside the Community who fall within the scope of Commission Decision 2001/497/EC of 15 June 2001 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries, under Directive 95/46/EC(4).
(11) The standard contractual clauses should provide for the technical and organisational security measures ensuring a level of security appropriate to the risks represented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected that a data processor established in a third country not providing adequate protection must apply. Parties should make provision in the contract for those technical and organisational measures which, having regard to applicable data protection law, the state of the art and the cost of their implementation, are necessary in order to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access or any other unlawful forms of processing.
(12) In order to facilitate data flows from the Community, it is desirable that processors providing data processing services to several data controllers in the Community be allowed to apply the same technical and organisational security measures irrespective of the Member State from which the data transfer originates, in particular in those cases where the data importer receives data for further processing from different establishments of the data exporter in the Community, in which case the law of the designated Member State of establishment should apply.
(13) It is appropriate to lay down the minimum information that the parties must specify in the contract dealing with the transfer. Member States should retain the power to particularise the information the parties are required to provide. The operation of this Decision should be reviewed in the light of experience.
(14) The data importer should process the transferred personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in accordance with his instructions and the obligations contained in the clauses. In particular the data importer should not disclose the personal data to a third party unless in accordance with certain conditions. The data exporter should instruct the data importer throughout the duration of the data processing Services to process the data in accordance with his instructions, the applicable data protection laws and the obligations contained in the clauses. The transfer of personal data to processors established outside the Community does not prejudice the fact that the processing activities should be governed in any case by the applicable data protection law.
(15) The standard contractual clauses should be enforceable not only by the organisations which are parties to the contract, but also by the data subjects, in particular where the data subjects suffer damage as a consequence of a breach of the contract.
(16) The data subject should be entitled to take action and, where appropriate, receive compensation from the data exporter who is the data controller of the personal data transferred. Exceptionally, the data subject should also be entitled to take action, and, where appropriate, receive compensation from the data importer in those cases, arising out of a breach by the data importer of any of his obligations referred to in the second paragraph of clause 3, where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent.
(17) In the event of a dispute between a data subject, who invokes the third-party beneficiary clause and the data importer, which is not amicably resolved, the data importer should agree to provide the data subject with the choice between mediation, arbitration or litigation. The extent to which the data subject will have an effective choice should depend on the availability of reliable and recognised systems of mediation and arbitration. Mediation by the data protection supervisory authorities of the Member State in which the data exporter is established should be an option where they provide such a service.
(18) The contract should be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established enabling a third-party beneficiary to enforce a contract. Data subjects should be allowed to be represented by associations or other bodies if they so wish and if authorised by national law.
(19) The Working Party on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered an opinion on the level of protection provided under the standard contractual clauses annexed to this Decision, which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision(5).
(20) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC,",['2300' '2828' '3011' '5334' '5595' '92']

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, (1) and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States’ laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25 thereof.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the European Union’s present international commitments.
(5) The State of Israel’s legal system has no written constitution but constitutional status has been conferred on certain ‘Basic Laws’ by the Supreme Court of the State of Israel. Those ‘Basic Laws’ are complemented by a large body of case law, as the Israeli legal system adheres to a great extent to common law principles. The right to privacy is included in the ‘Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty’ under section 7.
(6) The legal standards for the protection of personal data in the State of Israel are largely based on the standards set out in Directive 95/46/EC and are laid down in the Privacy Protection Act 5741-1981, lastly amended in 2007 in order to establish new processing requirements for personal data and the detailed organization of the supervisory authority.
(7) That data protection legislation is further complemented by governmental decisions on the implementation of the Privacy Protection Act 5741-1981 and on the organisation and functioning of the supervisory authority, largely based upon recommendations formulated in the Report to the Ministry of Justice by the Committee for the Examination of Legislation relating to Databases (Schoffman Report).
(8) Data protection provisions are also contained in a number of legal instruments regulating different sectors, such as financial sector legislation, health regulations and public registries.
(9) The legal data protection standards applicable in the State of Israel cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data in automated databases. Chapter 2 of Privacy Protection Act 5741-1981, which lays down the principles for the processing of personal data, does not apply to the processing of personal data in non-automated databases (manual databases).
(10) The application of the legal data protection standards is guaranteed by administrative and judicial remedies and by independent supervision carried out by the supervisory authority, the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority (ILITA), which is invested with powers of investigation and intervention, and which acts completely independently.
(11) Israeli data protection authorities have provided explanations and assurances as to how the Israeli law is to be interpreted, and have given assurances that the Israeli data protection legislation is implemented in accordance with such interpretation. This Decision takes account of these explanations and assurances, and is therefore conditional upon them.
(12) The State of Israel should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC with regard to automated international transfers of personal data from the European Union to the State of Israel or, where those transfers are not automated, they are subject to further automated processing in the State of Israel. Conversely, international transfers of personal data from the EU to the State of Israel whereby the transfer itself as well as the subsequent data processing is carried out exclusively through non-automated means should not be covered by this Decision.
(13) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(14) The adequacy findings pertaining to this Decision refer to the State of Israel, as defined in accordance with international law. Further onward transfers to a recipient outside the State of Israel, as defined in accordance with international law, should be considered as transfers of personal data to a third country.
(15) The Working Party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered a favourable opinion on the level of adequacy as regards protection of personal data in relation to automated international transfers of personal data from the European Union or, whether they are non-automated they are subject to further automated processing in the State of Israel. In its favourable opinion, the Working Party has encouraged the Israeli authorities to adopt further provisions which extend the application of Israeli legislation to manual databases, which expressly recognise the application of the proportionality principle to personal data processing in the private sector and which interpret the exemptions in international data transfers as in accordance with the criteria set out in its ‘Working document on a common interpretation of Article 26(1) of Directive 95/46/EC’ (2). This opinion has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision (3).
(16) The Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman,",['1518' '2828' '3011' '5181' '5334' '5595' '92']

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network (the interoperability Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation) (2), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Information exchanges between flight data processing systems are established between air traffic control units for the purposes of notification, coordination and transfer of flights and for the purposes of civil-military coordination. These information exchanges should rely upon appropriate and harmonised communication protocols to secure their interoperability.
(2) The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has been given a mandate in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 to develop requirements for a flight message transfer protocol to be used for the purpose of notification, coordination and transfer of flights. This Regulation is based on the resulting mandate report of 31 March 2005.
(3) The Eurocontrol standard for Flight Data Exchange was annexed to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2082/2000 of 6 September 2000 adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Directive 97/15/EC, adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Council Directive 93/65/EEC (3), making its use mandatory within the Community in the event of procurement of new flight data processing systems. As Regulation (EC) No 2082/2000 was repealed with effect from 20 October 2005, it is necessary to update Community legislation, so as to ensure the consistency of relevant regulatory provisions.
(4) It is becoming more and more difficult and costly to maintain Communication equipment and software complying with the Eurocontrol standard for Flight Data Exchange. An appropriate new standard to support the exchange of flight data should therefore be adopted.
(5) The Transmission Control Protocol together with the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is currently considered as the most appropriate basis to meet the communication requirements of flight data exchanges between air traffic control units.
(6) This Regulation should cover the application of a flight message transfer protocol used for the information exchanges in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1032/2006 of 6 July 2006 laying down requirements for automatic systems for the exchange of flight data for the purpose of notification, coordination and transfer of flights between air traffic control units (4).
(7) This Regulation should not cover military operations and training as referred in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004.
(8) In a statement on military issues related to the Single European Sky (5), the Member States committed themselves to cooperate with each other, taking into account national military requirements, in order that the concept of flexible use of airspace is fully and uniformly applied in all Member States by all users of airspace.
(9) The application of the concept of flexible use of airspace, as defined in Article 2(22) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, requires the establishment of systems for the timely exchange of flight data between air traffic service units and controlling military units.
(10) In accordance with Article 3(3)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, implementing rules for interoperability should describe the specific conformity assessment procedures to be used to assess either the conformity or the suitability for use of constituents as well as the verification of systems.
(11) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 552/2004, the date for the application of the essential requirements and transitional arrangements may be specified by the relevant implementing rules for interoperability.
(12) Manufacturers and air navigation service providers should be afforded a period of time to develop new constituents and systems in conformity with the new technical requirements.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee established by Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004,",['172' '2039' '3017' '3645' '4408' '4417' '5334' '616']

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (1), and in particular Article 9(1) and (2) thereof,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Whereas:
(1) On 24 June 2010 the Joint Customs Cooperation Committee, set up pursuant to Article 21 of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Japan on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters (2) adopted Decision No 1/2010 regarding mutual recognition of authorised economic operators programmes in the European Union and in Japan (3), (hereafter, ‘JCCC Decision No 1/2010’).
(2) JCCC Decision No 1/2010 provides in Section IV for an exchange of information between customs authorities as defined in Article 1(c) of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Japan on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters. According to that definition, the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the competent services of the Commission are deemed to be a customs authority.
(3) The information to be exchanged between the Japanese Ministry of Finance and the competent services of the Commission comprises of details on economic operators, which may also contain personal data. The transfer of data of economic operators falls within the tasks of the Commission to be carried out under JCCC Decision No 1/2010.
(4) Personal data to be exchanged are listed in Section IV(4)(a) to (f) of JCCC Decision No 1/2010. The duration of the transfers is for the whole period of time for which the Japanese Ministry of Finance uses the information in order to grant to European economic operators benefits under the terms of JCCC Decision No 1/2010. The Commission will regularly transfer updated and modified data of European economic operators to the Japanese Ministry of Finance. With regard to the exchange of information, Section IV(6) of JCCC Decision No 1/2010 restricts the use of any such data to the purposes of implementing the mutual recognition of authorised economic operator programmes between the European Union and Japan as established by that decision. The Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Japan on cooperation and mutual administrative assistance in customs matters also ensures that any such information, including personal data, is used by the Japanese Ministry of Finance solely for the purposes of their recognition as authorised economic operators in Japan. Authorised economic operator (AEO) data may not be transferred onward by the recipient authority to other authorities or services in or outside Japan because this would amount to a change of purpose not covered by JCCC Decision No 1/2010.
(5) Processing of personal data by Japanese public authorities, such as the Japanese Ministry of Finance, is governed by the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by Administrative Organs. The right of access to and procedures for consulting ‘Administrative Documents’ is laid down by the Japanese Act on Access to Information Held by Administrative Organs. Provisions on confidentiality of data handled by Japanese public authorities and data transfers between the Minister of Finance and foreign customs authorities respectively are included in the National Public Service Law and the Customs Law.
(6) Japanese data protection legislation requires Japanese public authorities, amongst which the Japanese Ministry of Finance, to provide data subjects with fair disclosure of information. Data subjects have a right to access, to initiate rectification and deletion of data relating to them.
(7) Japanese legislation ensures that organisational security measures, appropriate to the risks presented by data processing, are taken by the Japanese Ministry of Finance.
(8) Japanese legislation provides for an investigative mechanism in the form of a Review Board, which undertakes administrative appeals and investigation. This may be regarded as sufficient for the specific data transfer provided for by JCCC Decision No 1/2010 given the limited and non-sensitive nature of the data and the purposes of the data processing.
(9) The above provisions ensure that appropriate enforcement mechanisms are in place in Japan in order to guarantee the protection of the personal data which maybe transferred by the Commission for the purpose of identifying European economic operators with regard to their recognition as authorised economic operators in Japan.
(10) In the light of all the circumstances surrounding the set of the specific data transfer operations to be performed by the Commission in implementing JCCC Decision No 1/2010, the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, the rules of law, both general and sectoral, in force in Japan and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in Japan, the level of protection provided in Japan for the transfer of personal data from the competent services of the Commission to the Japanese Ministry of Finance in implementing JCCC Decision No 1/2010 is considered to be of an adequate level.
(11) This Decision should be limited to the specific situation referred to in JCCC Decision No 1/2010 as the assessment of Japanese data protection legal framework was based on the limited categories of data to be transferred, on the limited purpose for processing and on the limited duration of use of such data. Therefore this Decision is limited to the protection afforded to personal data transferred from the EU to Japan by the European Commission under the abovementioned JCCC Decision in view of the specific purpose and circumstances of their processing in Japan.
(12) This Decision is without prejudice to findings of the Commission in application of Article 25(4) and (6) of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (4),",['1524' '206' '4488' '4502' '5181' '5404' '5545' '5595']

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor (2),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States’ laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25 thereof.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the European Union’s present international commitments.
(5) The Political Constitution of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, passed in 1967, does not expressly recognise the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. However, the catalogue of fundamental rights is not a closed list since Article 72 of the Constitution provides that the listing of rights, obligations and guarantees made by the Constitution does not exclude others that are inherent to the human personality or that derive from the republican form of government. Article 1 of Act No 18.331 on the Protection of Personal Data and ‘Habeas Data’ Action of 11 August 2008 (Ley No 18.331 de Protección de Datos Personales y Acción de ‘Habeas Data’) expressly sets out that ‘the right to the protection of personal data is inherent to the human being and it is therefore included in Article 72 of the Constitution of the Republic’. Article 332 of the Constitution provides that the application of the provisions of this Constitution that acknowledge individuals’ rights as well as those awarding rights and imposing obligations on public authorities, shall not be impaired by of the lack of specific regulation; rather, it shall be based, through recourse to the underlying principles of similar laws, on the general principles of the law and generally accepted doctrines.
(6) The legal standards for the protection of personal data in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are largely based on the standards set out in Directive 95/46/EC and are laid down in Act No 18.331 on the Protection of Personal Data and ‘Habeas Data’ Action (Ley No 18.331 de Protección de Datos Personales y de Acción de ‘Habeas Data’) of 11 August 2008. It covers natural persons and legal persons.
(7) This Act is further complemented by Decree No 414/009 of 31 August 2009, adopted in order to clarify several aspects of the Act and to lay down the detailed regulation of the organisation, powers and functioning of the data protection supervisory authority; The Preamble of the Decree sets out that it is appropriate to adjust the national legal system on this matter to the most accepted comparable legal regime, essentially that established by European countries through Directive 95/46/EC.
(8) Data protection provisions are also contained in a number of special acts that create and regulate databases, namely, acts regulating certain public registries (public deeds, industrial property and trade marks, personal acts, real estate, mining or credit reporting). Act No 18.331 applies additionally to these acts in relation to those issues that are not governed by these specific legal instruments, pursuant to Article 332 of the Constitution.
(9) The legal data protection standards applicable in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, and also provide for exceptions and limitations in order to safeguard important public interests. These legal data protection standards and the exceptions reflect the principles laid down by Directive 95/46/EC.
(10) The application of the legal data protection standards is guaranteed by administrative and judicial remedies, in particular, by the ‘habeas data’ action, which enables a data subject to take a data controller to court in order to enforce his right of access, rectification and deletion, and by independent supervision carried out by the supervisory authority, the Unit for the Regulation and Control of Personal Data (Unidad Reguladora y de Control de Datos Personales (URCDP)), which is invested with powers of investigation, intervention and sanction in line with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC, and which acts completely independently. Moreover, any interested party is entitled to seek judicial redress for compensation for damages suffered as a result of the unlawful processing of his personal data.
(11) Uruguayan data protection authorities have provided explanations and assurances as to how the Uruguayan law is to be interpreted, and have given assurances that the Uruguayan data protection legislation is implemented in accordance with such interpretation. In particular, Uruguayan data protection authorities have explained that, pursuant to Article 332 of the Constitution, Act No 18.331 applies additionally to special acts that create and regulate specific databases in relation to those issues that are not governed by these specific legal instruments. They have also clarified that, regarding the lists referred to in Article 9 C) of Act No 18.331, and which do not require the consent of the data subject for the processing, the Act also applies, namely the principles of proportionality and finality, the rights of data subjects and that they are subject to the supervision by the data protection authority. With regard to the transparency principle, the Uruguayan data protection authorities have informed that the obligation to provide the data subject with the necessary information applies in all cases. Regarding the right of access, the data protection authority has clarified that it is sufficient for a data subject to prove its identity when making a request. The Uruguayan data protection authorities have clarified that the exceptions relating to the principle on international transfers laid down in Article 23(1) of Act No 18.331 cannot be understood as having a broader application than that of Article 26(1) of Directive 95/46/EC.
(12) This Decision takes into account these explanations and assurances and it is based upon them.
(13) The Eastern Republic of Uruguay is also party to the American Convention of Human Rights (‘Pact of San José de Costa Rica) of 22 November 1969, and in force since 18 July 1978 (3). Article 11 of this Convention lays down the right to privacy and Article 30 sets out that restrictions that, pursuant to this Convention, may be placed on the enjoyment or exercise of the rights or freedoms recognised by the Convention may not be applied except in accordance with laws enacted for reasons of general interest and in accordance with the purpose for which such restrictions have been established (Article 30). Moreover the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Furthermore at the 1118th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies of the Council of Europe held on 6 July 2011, the Deputies invited the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to accede the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No 108) and to its Additional Protocol (ETS No 118), after a favourable opinion of the relevant Consultative Committee (4).
(14) The Eastern Republic of Uruguay should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(15) This Decision should concern the adequacy of protection provided in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC. It should not affect other conditions or restrictions implementing other provisions of that Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States.
(16) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(17) The Commission should monitor the functioning of the Decision and report any pertinent findings to the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC. Such monitoring should cover, inter alia, the Eastern Republic of Uruguay’s regime applicable to transfers in the framework of international treaties.
(18) The Working Party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered a favourable opinion on the level of adequacy as regards protection of personal data which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision (5).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States' laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations, and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25(2) thereof. The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data, established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, issued guidance on the making of such assessments(2).
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) As regards Argentina, the legal standards on the protection of personal data have been provided for in general and sector-specific rules. Both of them have binding legal effect.
(6) General rules are laid down in the Constitution, the Personal Data Protection Act No 25.326 and the Regulation approved by Decree No 1558/2001 (hereinafter ""Argentine Law"").
(7) The Argentine Constitution provides for a special judicial remedy for the protection of personal data, known as ""habeas data"". This is a subcategory of the procedure enshrined in the Constitution for the protection of constitutional rights and therefore makes the protection of personal data a fundamental right. According to Article 43.3 of the Constitution any person is entitled, under the ""habeas data"" rule, to know the content and purpose of all the data pertaining to him or her contained in public records or data banks, or in private ones whose purpose is to provide reports. According to that Article in case of falsehood of information or its use for discriminatory purposes, a person will be able to demand the deletion, correction, confidentiality or update of the data contained in the above records. The Article will not affect the secrecy of journalistic information sources. Argentine jurisprudence has recognised ""habeas data"" as a fundamental and directly applicable right.
(8) The Personal Data Protection Act No 25.326 of 4 October 2000 (hereinafter ""the Act"") develops and widens the Constitutional provisions. It contains provisions relating to general data protection principles, the rights of data subjects, the obligations of data controllers and data users, the supervisory authority or controlling body, sanctions, and rules of procedure in seeking ""habeas data"" as a judicial remedy.
(9) The Regulation, approved by Decree No 1558/2001 of 3 December 2001 (hereinafter ""the Regulation""), lays down rules for the enactment of the Act, supplements its provisions, and clarifies points of the Act that may be subject to diverging interpretation.
(10) Argentine Law covers the protection of personal data recorded in data files, registers, data banks or other technical means, which are public; and the protection of personal data recorded in data files, registers, data banks or other technical means which are private, whose purpose is to provide reports. This includes those which go beyond an exclusively personal use, and those which are intended for the assignment or transfer of personal data, irrespective of whether the circulation of the data or information produced is performed for payment or free of charge.
(11) Certain provisions of the Act apply uniformly throughout Argentina. They include general provisions and provisions concerning general data protection principles, rights of the data subjects, obligations of data controllers and users of data files, registers and data banks, criminal sanctions, and the existence and main features of the ""habeas data"" judicial remedy as established in the Constitution.
(12) Other provisions of the Act apply to registers, data files, databases or data banks which are interconnected through networks at inter-jurisdictional (meaning ""interprovincial""), national or international level, and which are considered as falling within federal jurisdiction. They concern the control exercised by the supervisory authority, sanctions imposed by the supervisory authority, and the rules of procedure concerning the ""habeas data"" judicial remedy. Other kinds of registers, data files, databases or data banks should be regarded as falling under provincial jurisdiction. The provinces may issue legal provisions on these matters.
(13) Data protection provisions are also contained in a number of legal instruments regulating different sectors, such as credit card transactions, statistics, banking or health.
(14) Argentine Law covers all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, even if exceptions and limitations are also provided in order to safeguard important public interests. The application of these standards is guaranteed by a special, simplified and quick judicial remedy for the protection of personal data, known as ""habeas data"", along with the general judicial remedies. The Act provides for the establishment of a data protection controlling body charged with taking all actions necessary for compliance with the objectives and provisions of the Act and endowed with powers of investigation and intervention. Pursuant to the Regulation, the National Directorate for the Protection of Personal Data was established as the controlling body. Argentine Law provides for effective dissuasive sanctions, of both an administrative and a criminal nature. Furthermore, the provisions of Argentine law regarding civil liability (both contractual and extra-contractual) apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned.
(15) The Argentine government has provided explanations and assurances as to how the Argentine law is to be interpreted, and has given assurances that the Argentine data protection rules are implemented in accordance with such interpretation. This Decision is based on these explanations and assurances, and is therefore conditional upon them. In particular, this decision relies on the explanations and assurances given by the Argentine authorities as to how the Argentine law is to be interpreted as regards which situations fall within the scope of the Argentine law in data protection.
(16) Argentina should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(17) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(18) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered an opinion on the level of protection of personal data in Argentina(3), which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision.
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC,",['2525' '5181' '5595']

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a), in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 2 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union with Australia for the transfer and use of passenger name record (PNR) data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime.
(2) The Agreement between the European Union and Australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (PNR) data by air carriers to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (the Agreement) has been negotiated. The negotiations were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Agreement.
(3) The Agreement should be signed subject to its conclusion at a later date, and the Declaration attached to the Final Act of the Agreement should be approved.
(4) The Agreement respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter), notably the right to respect for private and family life, recognised in Article 7 of the Charter, the right to the protection of personal data, recognised in Article 8 of the Charter and the right to effective remedy and fair trial recognised in Article 47 of the Charter. The Agreement should be applied in accordance with those rights and principles.
(5) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, those Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(a) and Article 63(3)(b) thereof,
Having regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Spain (1),
Whereas:
(1) In order to combat illegal immigration effectively and to improve border control, it is essential that all Member States introduce provisions laying down obligations on air carriers transporting passengers into the territory of the Member States. In addition, in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, the financial penalties currently provided for by the Member States for cases where carriers fail to meet their obligations should be harmonised to the extent possible, taking into account the differences in legal systems and practices between the Member States.
(2) The European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004 adopted a Declaration on combating terrorism stressing the need to expedite examination of measures in this area and take work forward on the proposed Council Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data with a view to an early conclusion on this measure.
(3) It is important to avoid a vacuum in the Community's action in combating illegal immigration.
(4) As from 1 May 2004 the Council can no longer act on an initiative of a Member State.
(5) The Council has exhausted all possibilities to obtain in time the opinion of the European Parliament.
(6) Under these exceptional circumstances the Directive should be adopted without the opinion of the European Parliament.
(7) The obligations to be imposed on carriers by virtue of this Directive are complementary to those established pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 of the 1990 Schengen Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, as supplemented by Council Directive 2001/51/EC (2), the two types of obligation serving the same objective of curbing migratory flows and combating illegal immigration.
(8) Without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3), the freedom of the Member States to retain or introduce additional obligations for aircarriers or some categories of other carriers, including information or data in relation to return tickets, whether referred to in this Directive or not, should not be affected.
(9) In order to combat illegal immigration more effectively and in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, it is essential that, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, account be taken at the earliest opportunity of any technological innovation, especially with reference to the integration and use of biometric features in the information to be provided by the carriers.
(10) Member States should ensure that in any proceedings brought against carriers which may result in the application of penalties, the rights of defence and the right of appeal against such decisions can be exercised effectively.
(11) These measures take up the control options set out in the Decision of the Executive Committee of Schengen (SCH/Com-ex (94) 17-rev. 4), aimed at enabling border checks to be increased and providing for sufficient time to enable detailed and comprehensive checks to be carried out on all passengers through the transmission of passenger data to the authorities responsible for carrying out such controls.
(12) Directive 95/46/EC applies with regard to the processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States. This means, that whereas it would be legitimate to process the passenger data transmitted for the performance of border checks also for the purposes of allowing their use as evidence in proceedings aiming at the enforcement of the laws and regulations on entry and immigration, including their provisions on the protection of public policy (ordre public) and national security, any further processing in a way incompatible with those purposes would run counter to the principle set out in Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46/EC. Member States should provide for a system of sanctions to be applied in the event of use contrary to the purpose of the present Directive.
(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Directive whether it will implement it in its national law.
(14) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point E, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (5).
(15) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (6).
(16) Ireland is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis

(5) As regards Hungary, the legal standards on the protection of personal data have binding legal effect.
(6) The protection of privacy, particularly with regard to the processing of personal data, is provided for by Article 59 of the Hungarian Constitution. The legal provisions are laid down by Law LXIII of 17 November 1992, which entered into force on 1 May 1993. Various sectoral laws have also incorporated provisions on the protection of personal data in various areas such as statistics, market research, scientific research and health.
(7) With effect from 1 February 1998, Hungary ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention No 108)(3), which aims to reinforce the protection of personal data and to ensure free circulation between the Contracting Parties, subject to any exceptions which these parties may provide for. Without being directly applicable, the Convention lays down the international commitments concerning not only the basic principles of protection which each Contracting Party must implement in its internal law but also the mechanisms of cooperation between the Contracting Parties. In particular, the competent Hungarian authorities must provide the authorities of the other Contracting Parties which so request with any information on the law and administrative practice regarding data protection, and with information on any specific instance of automatic processing of data. They must also assist any person residing abroad in exercising his right to be informed about the existence of processing operations on data concerning him, the right to access his data or to ask for them to be corrected or deleted, and the right of judicial remedy.
(8) The legal standards applicable in Hungary cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, even if exceptions and limitations are also provided for in order to safeguard important public interests. The application of these standards is guaranteed by judicial remedy and by independent supervision carried out by the Commissioner appointed by the Parliament pursuant to Law LXIII of 1992. Furthermore, the compensation of persons who have suffered prejudice as a result of unlawful processing is guaranteed by law.
(9) In the interests of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify in this Decision the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.

After consulting the Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of personal data(2),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States' laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations, and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25(2) thereof.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) The Bailiwick of Guernsey is one of the dependencies of the British Crown (being neither part of the United Kingdom nor a colony) that enjoys full independence, except for international relations and defence which are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. The Bailiwick of Guernsey should therefore be considered as a third country within the meaning of the Directive.
(6) With effect from August 1987, the United Kingdom's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (Convention No 108) was extended to the Bailiwick of Guernsey.
(7) As regards the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the legal standards on the protection of personal data based on the standards set out in Directive 95/46/EC have been provided for in the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2001, which entered into force on 1 August 2002.
(8) Sixteen statutory instruments (orders) have also been adopted in Guernsey in 2002, laying down specific rules concerning issues such as subject access, processing of sensitive data and notification to the data protection authority. These instruments complement the law.
(9) The legal standards applicable in Guernsey cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons. The application of these standards is guaranteed by judicial remedy and by independent supervision carried out by the authorities, such as the Data Protection Commissioner invested with powers of investigation and intervention.
(10) Guernsey should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(11) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC,",['1290' '3011' '362' '5181' '5595' '92']
