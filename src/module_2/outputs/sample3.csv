THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee established by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and on Information Society Services (2), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC (3) (Committee on standards and technical regulations),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Directive 88/378/EEC provides that toys must be placed on the market only if they do not jeopardise the safety and/or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children.
(2) Pursuant to the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, toys are presumed to comply with the essential safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive if they conform to the national standards applicable to them transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(3) According to the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States are required to publish the reference numbers of national standards transposing harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(4) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), under mandate from the Commission, drew up and adopted the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 ‘Safety of toys — Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ on 15 July 1998, the references of which were published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 28 July 1999 (4).
(5) On 19 September 2005, the European Committee for Standardisation adopted the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys — Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ which is a consolidated version of the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 and its 11 amendments.
(6) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 88/378/EEC, the Spanish authorities have raised a formal objection in respect to the requirements on projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area intended for children above the age of three years laid down in the standard EN 71-1:2005. The Spanish authorities claim that the standard does not provide enough protection for projectiles toys intended for children above the age of three years. According to the Spanish authorities, a child older than three years might detach a suction cup from a projectile using a force higher than a force of 60 N laid down in clause 8.4.2.3 ‘test for protective components’.
(7) The standard EN 71-1:2005 lays down different requirements for toys with suction cups depending on the age of the child. Regarding toys with suction cups intended for children under the age of three years, the standard requires that the ‘tension test’ be performed with a tensile force of 50 N (in case the largest accessible dimension is 6 mm or less) or of 90 N (in case the largest accessible dimension is greater than 6 mm). Regarding projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area that are intended for children above the age of three years, the standard requires in clause 4.17.1(b) that resilient materials used as impact surfaces shall not become detached when tested according to clause 8.4.2.3 (tension test, protective components). The tension test for protective components specified in clause 8.4.2.3 is performed with a force of 60 N.
(8) The Commission has been informed of several accidents with projectiles toys with a suction cup as an impact surface intended for children above the age of three years. In 1997, a Swedish child of nine years old suffocated to death after having sucked on a suction cup tip which he accidentally inhaled. Two other fatalities have occurred in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Commission has been informed of eight fatalities registered in the United States. More recently, in August 2005, the Spanish authorities informed the Commission of a fatal accident with a four years old child caused by a bow and arrow toy with a suction cup.
(9) Suction cups affixed to projectile toys are intended for securing the projectile to a surface. Sticking and unsticking the projectiles imply that the suction cup is submitted to repeated stress. Furthermore, children above three years old often bring suction cups to their mouths to moisture the cups before sticking them on a surface. If the suction cup is not properly secured on the toy it is foreseeable that it can be detached during normal and foreseeable use. If the suction cup becomes detached and enters entirely in the mouth, it can block the airway at the back of the mouth and upper throat and cause asphyxiation.
(10) On the basis of these findings, the Member States consider that children above the age of three years should be given the same protection as children under the age of three years. Thus, suction cups used as impact surfaces on toy projectiles intended for children over three years shall not become detached when submitted at least to the relevant tests laid down in clause 5.13.b of EN 71-1:2005, in particular to ‘torque test’ (clause 8.3) and ‘tension test, general’ (clause 8.4.2.1).
(11) Consequently, on the basis of the information submitted by the Spanish authorities, the other national authorities and the Committee on standards and technical regulations the Commission considers that the standard EN 71-1:2005 presents shortcomings regarding the technical requirements for projectiles toys with suction cups as an impact area intended for children above the age of three years.
(12) Pending the revision of the standard, in the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the reference of the standard EN 71-1:2005 should therefore be accompanied by an appropriate notice.
(13) In absence of a standard that covers the abovementioned risks and according to Article 5(2) of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States shall presume that the abovementioned toys satisfy the essential safety requirements only if they have an EC type examination certificate issued by a notified body which conformity with the approved model has been certified by the affixation of the EC marking,",['1391' '3646' '3648' '4036' '5235']

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the application made by the notification on 1 June 1982 by the jewellery manufacturer, Murat SA, Viry-Chatillon, France, for negative clearance or, failing that, exemption of a proposed standard form agreement with the retailers of its products in a number of Community countries,
Having regard to the summary of the application published (2) in accordance with Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
Having heard the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
WHEREAS:
I. THE FACTS
A. The undertaking
(1) Murat is a public limited company with a registered office at Viry-Chatillon, France, whose shares are mainly held by non-corporate investors. Its main business is the manufacture of gold, silver and gold-plated jewellery, the latter chiefly rolled gold with a high gold content which is applied by a process used by Murat since 1847. The company, which owns three factories in France employing about 450, is one of the biggest employers in the French jewellery industry, which despite a tendency towards concentration is still quite widely dispersed. In a secondary capacity Murat also distributes under its brand name jewellery and watches made by others.
(2) Murat sells the biggest part of its products on the French market, which accounts for about 90 % of its annual turnover. Its share of that market varies according to the type of product concerned: 4 % for gold, 14 to 15 % for silver, 30 % for gold-plated (making it the market leader in this class) and 60 % for the rolled gold category of gold-plated. Within the EEC Murat exports mainly to Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, but its market share in these countries is quite small. In a small way it has also quite recently entered the United Kingdom, Irish and Dutch markets, and occasionally sells to Italy and Greece as well. Its exports to non-EEC countries - Switzerland and latterly also Austria, Spain and countries outside Europe - are fairly insignificant.
(3) To promote sales of its brand both inside and outside the common market, Murat has built up a distribution system which operates as follows: the method of supplying retailers varies depending on the country. In France and Germany retailers are supplied by Murat representatives direct.
In the Belgium-Luxembourg area its products are marketed to the retailers by an exclusive distributor bound to Murat by an exclusive distribution agreement, which was notified in 1963 and fulfils the conditions of the block
exemption granted for such agreements by Commission Regulations No 67/67/EEC (1) and (EEC) No 1983/83 (2). Since less than two years there have also been exclusive distributors for the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Netherlands and the non-EEC countries Austria and Spain.
For the other continents Murat has two sales representatives who make annual sales tours to various countries.
(4) The retailing of Murat products is handled by a network of around 7 000 retailers in France, 1 000 in Germany and 650 in Belgium and Luxembourg, and Murat is also planning to expand its network in the countries in which it has entered the market.
B. The notified agreement
(5) The notified draft agreement is intended to serve as the standard form agreement governing relations between Murat and its retailers in all the countries in which it does business. It embodies the requirements currently applied by Murat in authorizing retailers to sell its products.
(6) The requirements are as follows. The dealer must:
- carry on a business as a retail jeweller/watchmaker either from a shop or from a self-contained specialist department,
- possess the necessary professional knowledge, evidence by either the certificate of a jewellery or watchmaking college or by at least four years' experience in the trade in either sales or repair work,
- have premises used exclusively for trade in jewellery, clocks and watches, gold and silver plate, table ornaments and luxury gift articles.
(7) Murat retailers further undertake:
- to order such quantities as both to cover their own requirements and match the quantities usually delivered by Murat, the minimum stocks taken on such occasions to represent at least three months' sales of Murat brand products. This minimum order size is much lower than that customary in the trade. Retailers generally order two or three times a year, i.e. four to six months' supplies at a time,
- to keep stock under good conditions and to display the product to advantage,
- not to mix Murat products with others of similar appearance but different quality,
- to use the promotional aids and advertising material supplied by Murat for displaying Murat products in their shops,
- when asked to repair Murat brand jewellery, either to carry out such repair work themselves or have it done by others whose workmanship they can control or, where the work is such that there is a danger of damaging the article, to return the products to Murat's after-sales service department.
(8) Murat undertakes in return:
- to do its best to fulfil either direct or through its exclusive distributors orders placed by authorized retailers,
- to supply or permit to be supplied only retailers who meet the requirements of the agreement,
- to place its full technical, commercial and promotional expertise at dealers' disposal to help them boost their sales,
- to mount nation-wide advertising campaigns and allow retailers to use this advertising at local level with posters, shields, display stands and small catalogues,
- to honour its warranty and devote the utmost care to any product of its manufacture returned for repair or alteration.
(9) The notified standard form agreement contains no provisions on price fixing. Retailers are free to set their own prices. Some of the annual catalogues which Murat publishes for jewellery retailers to distribute contain recommended prices. Such prices are not in any way binding and quite large differences can in fact be found in the prices charged even by retailers quite close together.
The agreement has a one-year term, which is renewable by tacit agreement. It may be terminated for breaches of the retailer's obligations.
(10) The notified standard form agreement originally contained a clause which Murat has since amended in response to observations made by the Commission. The clause forbade authorized retailers to 'sell Murat products outside the usual distribution channels to unauthorized dealers'. Murat have now limited the prohibition to the sale of Murat products 'outside the usual distribution channels to any dealer not meeting the general requirements covered in the criteria of professional competence', i.e. criteria set out in paragraph 6.
(11) The Commission has received no observations from third parties following publication of the notice required by Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
(12) The notified standard form agreement governing the relations between Murat and its retailers embodies the terms of the selective distribution system set up by Murat at the retail level and is an agreement between undertakings within the meaning of Article 85 of the Treaty.
(13) As has been established in cases before the Court of Justice, agreements concerned with selective distribution systems are not caught by Article 85 (1) of the Treaty when the dealers in question are selected on objective, qualitative criteria related to the capacity of the dealer, his staff and premises and bearing in mind the genuine requirements of distribution of the products, and provided that such criteria are laid down in a uniform manner for all prospective dealers and applied in a non-discriminatory fashion.
(14) In the present case, the requirements Murat has laid down for admission to the authorized retailer network are purely of a general, technical and professional nature. The requirements, concerning the retailer's standard of professional training and technical knowledge and the intended purpose and appearance of his premises (see paragraph 6 above) are such as, in general, to exclude from the distribution system only traders who would be unable to sell articles of jewellery under conditions that were satisfactory for the consumers or who would be unable to supply services ancillary to distribution. Satisfactory conditions for the sale of high-quality gold, silver and high-gold-content gold-plated jewellery are afforded only by specialist shops which have trained staff and adequate storage and display facilities. Retailers must also be capable of undertaking warranty obligations and providing after-sales service, either themselves or through third parties.
These requirements are laid down uniformly for all potential retailers. Furthermore, retailers meeting the requirements are not subject to approval in all cases by Murat before being supplied with its products (see paragraph 10 above) so that the system does not lend itself to a discriminatory application.
(15) Nor are the other obligations imposed on retailers caught by Article 85 (1) of the Treaty. The obligation to use the promotional aids supplied by Murat for displaying its products and not to mix Murat products with others of similar appearance but different quality do not restrict competition, but seek to enhance the presentation and brand image of Murat products and avoid confusion with other brands. They do not prevent Murat retailers from selling competing products. The obligation, to take at least three months' supplies each time the authorized retailer orders, is not in this case significantly restrictive from a competition point of view since this quantity is less than that customary in the trade (see first indent of paragraph 7 above).
(16) The obligations undertaken by Murat, in particular to supply or permit to be supplied only retailers who meet the specified requirements, represent a normal consideration for the commitments accepted by retailers and are in accordance with the Community competition rules.
(17) Since the notified standard form agreement does not contain any obligation having as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market or liable to affect trade between the Member States, there are no grounds, on the basis of the facts in the Commission's possession, for action on its part under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty. The Commission can therefore give the agreement negative clearance under Article 2 of Regulation No 17,",['3218' '3897' '478' '5']

Having regard to the publication of a summary of the application and notification (2) pursuant to Article 19 (3) of the said Regulation No 17 and of the Commission's intention to take a favourable decision,
After consultation with the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas
I. THE FACTS
The parties
(1) IBM Europe SA is a subsidiary of IBM World Trade Europe/Middle East/Africa Corporation, itself ultimately a subsidiary of the International Business Machines Corporation of the State of New York in the USA. It made the said application and notification on behalf of:
- IBM UK International Products Ltd, and of:
- IBM Belgium Distribution Company SA,
- IBM Danmark Produkt Distribution Selskab A/S,
- IBM Deutschland Produktvertrieb GmbH,
- IBM EMEA Product Distribution Corporation,
- IBM France Diffusion SA,
- IBM Ireland Product Distribution Ltd,
- IBM Italia Distribuzione Prodotti Srl,
- IBM Nederland Distributie BV, and
- IBM UK Product Sales Ltd.
The IBM group is the largest manufacturer or provider of information-handling systems, equipment and services in the world. IBM UK International Products Ltd supplies the IBM personal computers to the other companies listed, which are the IBM subsidiaries that sell this computer to dealers (and also to end users) within their Member State (apart from IBM Belgium Distribution Company SA which also sells to dealers in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg). IBM UK International Products Ltd also supplies IBM subsidiaries outside the Community, and any independent distributor appointed by IBM.
The product and market
(2) The goods affected by the arrangements are the IBM personal computers and related peripheral and software products. These are now the smallest systems in the IBM range of products. They are based on a micro-processor. They are in competition with other micro-computers. These are sold mainly for private use in the home, for individual use in business or education, for personal professional use or for small firms. The IBM personal computers are at the more expensive end of the range of micro-computers.
(3) Most mainframe and mini-computer manufacturers sell direct to the end user. IBM continues to do this for most of its product range. Micro-computers, however, have mostly been sold through independent retail outlets or software houses. IBM intends to offer its personal computer systems direct to end users from those of its own offices equipped to do so, but also to sell through both wholesalers and retailers.
(4) When micro-computers first became widely available, they were often sold through non-specialized outlets such as the retailers of consumer electronics, bookshops or mail-order houses. Some micro-computers (more particularly the smaller ones aimed more at home use) are still sold through such outlets. However, some manufacturers (IBM among them) of larger micro-computers, more often bought for business or professional use, believe that some users inexpert in such use of data processing have bought from such outlets inappropriate systems they were unable to use satisfactorily, and that this has harmed the reputation of their products. It is for this reason and to ensure that users receive proper after-sales service that IBM wish to create a selective distribution system. It is based on objective criteria, and IBM will appoint as an authorized dealer or distributor, as the case may be, every applicant satisfying the criteria. Their object is to make the IBM personal computer hardware and software available to users through as many outlets capable of offering skilled pre- and after-sales service as possible.
(5) The markets in which the arrangements have their effects, therefore, are the retailing of micro-computer hardware and software for business or professional use and the supplying of retailers and wholesalers of such micro-computers.
The selective distribution system
(6) The criteria for appointment as an authorized dealer are:
1. Sales staff experienced in business use of micro-computers, trained, or ready to be trained (one week), in the IBM personal computers;
2. Appropriate space for demonstration and display of the computers and willingness to keep at least one available for demonstration purposes;
3. Ability to provide customers with technical support and training;
4. Service facilities and experienced staff trained (three days) in servicing the IBM personal computers;
5. Ability to run a micro-computer sales business;
6. Favourable banker's reference and credit rating;
7. Prospective dealer has no contractual obligation preventing him becoming a dealer;
8. Acceptance of IBM terms and conditions;
9. Compliance with the law and IBM's code of professional conduct; this code forbids the dealer to make false claims for IBM's products or false or disparaging statements about competitors' products.
(7) A chain of dealers with its own distribution system asked IBM whether IBM would grant it an extra discount if the chain bought in bulk from IBM's factory and provided its dealers with the delivery and back-up after-sales service normally supplied to dealers by IBM's national distribution companies. IBM agreed, and is offering to appoint any other chain of outlets or independent wholesaler as a distributor on the same terms. The selection criteria for distributors are similar to those for dealers.
(8) IBM sells to distributors fob Greenock at its published distributor prices, which are expressed in ÂŁ sterling. IBM sells to dealers from its personal-computer product sales subsidiaries or branches at their published dealer prices expressed in local currency, and to end users from its own sales force and retail outlets at their published retail prices again expressed in local currency. Distributors are free to fix their own selling prices and to buy from or sell to any other authorized distributor or dealer in any Western European country, which includes all Member States. Dealers are also free to fix their own selling prices and to buy from any other authorized dealer or distributor and to sell to any end-user or any other authorized dealer or distributor, in any Western European country.
(9) IBM has a standard contract for distributors, expressed in English, and a standard contract for dealers expressed in the language or languages appropriate for each Member State (save that the Greek dealer contract is expressed in English). The various dealer's contracts are identical apart from language and some minor differences necessary to adapt them to the different systems of law of each Member State.
(10) After amendments, following discussion with the Commission, aimed at ensuring that the selection criteria be objectively applied without discrimination and that the contracts offer no opportunity of abuse, the following are among the terms of the dealer contracts:
1. A dealer is appointed for three years, renewable; a dealer may terminate the agreement without reason at any time; IBM may terminate only if IBM decides to cease completely distribution through dealers (this at one year's notice to all dealers) or for breach of contract by the dealer, duly reasoned and notified;
2. The dealer is specifically free to fix its own prices without any reference to or influence from IBM;
3. IBM may only refuse a dealer's order if out of stock;
4. A dealer must submit its advertisements (but not including any advertised prices or conditions) for IBM approval;
5. A dealer must maintain a record of customers' names and addresses, serial numbers of purchases and dates of delivery, for the purposes of repairs under warranty, and make the record available to IBM in the event of any necessary safety changes;
6. Within the warranty period, a dealer must provide service under warranty for any machine whether originally supplied by it or by IBM or any other authorized dealer within Western Europe (which includes the whole of the Community); IBM pays dealers for warranty services performed;
7. A dealer is free to sell competing products, and has an obligation to describe IBM and competing products to prospective customers fairly;
8. A dealer may nominate other prospective dealers; IBM undertake to process such nominations within two months (the time they take to process direct applications and train applicants' staff) and appoint if the prospective dealer is qualified.
The distributor's contract contains similar terms. The main differences are: the duration is one year instead of three; IBM undertakes to appoint distributor's nominees for dealerships by default if their applications are not processed within two months; the distributor agrees to buy in bulk ex factory and service the dealers it supplies.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
(11) Article 85 (1) prohibits as incompatible with the common market all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings, and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.
(12) As the Court of Justice of the European Communities held in the AEG-Telefunken case: 'Agreements that create a selective distribution system necessarily affect competition within the common market' (Case 107/82 Allgemeine Elektricitaets-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken AG, 33rd ground, judgment of 25 October 1983, not yet reported).
(13) On the other hand, the Court has also recognized that the nature of some goods and services is such that they cannot usefully be offered to the public other than by specialized outlets - for example, other than by someone capable of providing expert advice, or in the absence of expert servicing (see ibidem or Case 31/80 L'Oreal v. De Nieuwe AMCK (1980) ECR 3775 at paragraphs 15 and 16). (14) Computers are not simple products. Moreover, apart from the simplest computer bought for use as it were as a toy at home, they are not even single products, but rather a range of different products used together, as are the amplifier, the turntable and loudspeakers in a hi-fi system. The capabilities and price of the IBM personal computer make the business or professional user the most likely customer. In order first to choose and then operate a computer for business or professional purposes, the buyer must have, or be able to obtain information or advice on a number of different topics:
1. The nature of the business or professional operations capable of being performed by computers;
2. How to program computers to perform such operations and (and increasingly) the capabilities of available ready-made programs (i.e. software);
3. How to choose appropriate different products capable of working together in a system, and how to make them so work; and
4. The costs and capabilities of alternative systems (i.e. different combination of products) and their relation to the potential advantages or cost savings they make possible in the particular business or professional circumstances.
It is reasonable that a manufacturer should insist that its dealers are able to give such information or advice about the manufacturer's computers. In addition, most users will wish to try out different systems before purchasing, and rely on the availability of expert post-sales advice and repair and maintenance service. There are no national rules governing admission to or conditions of sale in the trade. Computer products such as the IBM personal computers do, therefore, at present justify a selective distribution system.
(15) This conclusion is based on the present situation in this market in which new highly technical products are being sold mainly to inexperienced users who have not enjoyed the education in computers that is now being offered in many schools and colleges.
(16) The criteria outlined at paragraph 6 above are of an objective nature and relate to the qualifications of the distributor or dealer or of his staff and the suitability of his premises. Moreover the conditions of contract have been drafted or modified so as to remove the possibility of abuse, and IBM have stated that it is their intention to appoint any candidate satisfying their criteria, and their object to appoint as many qualified distributors or dealers as possible.
(17) The criteria for the selection of dealers set out in paragraph 6 go no further than may reasonably be thought necessary for the distribution of the products in question and do not, therefore, fall under Article 85 (1). For this reason, and in the circumstances of this case, in particular because the evidence is that there will be no effort to maintain resale prices, the terms of the agreements summarized at paragraph 10 do not fall under Article 85 (1) either. The Commission therefore has adequate grounds for granting IBM a negative clearance for their selective distribution system,",['2157' '478' '75']

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys (1), and in particular Article 46(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure a high level of protection of children against risks caused by chemical substances in toys, Directive 2009/48/EC establishes certain requirements with regard to chemical substances such as those classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR) under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), allergenic fragrances and certain elements. In addition, Directive 2009/48/EC empowers the Commission to adopt specific limit values for chemicals used in toys which are intended for children under 36 months and in other toys intended to be placed in the mouth in order to ensure adequate protection in the case of toys involving a high degree of exposure. The adoption of such limit values takes the form of an inclusion in Appendix C to Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC.
(2) For a number of chemicals, currently applicable limit values are either too high in the light of available scientific evidence or do not exist. Specific limit values should therefore be adopted for them, taking into account the packaging requirements for food as well as the differences between toys and food contact materials.
(3) In order to advise the European Commission in the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives in the area of toy safety, the Commission established the Expert Group on Toys Safety. The mission of its subgroup ‘Chemicals’ is to provide such advice with regard to chemical substances which may be used in toys.
(4) Formamide (CAS number 75-12-7) is used, among others, in the plastics and polymers industry, particularly as a solvent, plasticiser or as a substance associated with a blowing agent used in the production of foam (3). In 2010, several Member States identified formamide in a range of foam toys, such as puzzle mats, which gave rise to concerns for the health of children through inhalation. Some Member States took or were considering taking regulatory action.
(5) In its deliberations about formamide the subgroup ‘Chemicals’ took the opinion of the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) as a basis. The opinion recommended that emission into the air of formamide from puzzle mats be limited, so that it does not exceed 20 μg/m3 measured 28 days after unpacking and confinement in an outgassing chamber of new mats before their sale, following a test method (4) in accordance with the ISO 16000-6 and 16000-9 standards and under suitable conditions for sampling within products and batches of products.
(6) The subgroup ‘Chemicals’ further considered a nursery (room volume 30 m3) with a large puzzle mat (1,2 m2, 720 g) and several other foam toys (thus adding up to 1 kg of foam toy materials exposed to the air). The air in that nursery (air exchange rate 0,5 h– 1) would contain 20 μg/m3 formamide after 28 days if the formamide content in the foam toy materials were at approximately 200 mg/kg and were completely emitted.
(7) Formamide is classified under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as toxic to reproduction category 1B. According to point 4 of Part III of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC, substances toxic to reproduction of category 1B such as formamide may be present in toys in concentrations equal to or smaller than the relevant concentration established for the classification of mixtures containing it, namely 0,5 %, which equals 5 000 mg/kg (content limit), before 1 June 2015, and 0,3 %, which equals 3 000 mg/kg (content limit) thereafter. Directive 2009/48/EC does not currently provide for an emission limit for formamide.
(8) In the light of the above, the subgroup ‘Chemicals’ recommended, at its meeting of 28 November 2013, that emissions of formamide from foam toy materials be limited in Appendix C to Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC to 20 μg/m3 after a maximum of 28 days from commencement of the emission testing. The subgroup further recommended, at its meeting of 18 February 2015, that emission testing is not necessary when the formamide content is 200 mg/kg or less (cut-off value derived in a worst-case exposure scenario).
(9) There are no known uses of formamide in food contact materials to be considered.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 47 of Directive 2009/48/EC,",['1391' '2420' '2739' '3135' '3646' '4036' '4211' '4307' '5234' '5235']

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee established by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and on Information Society Services (2), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC (Committee on standards and technical regulations),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Directive 88/378/EEC provides that toys must be placed on the market only if they do not jeopardise the safety and/or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children.
(2) Pursuant to the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, toys are presumed to comply with the essential safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive if they conform to the national standards applicable to them transposing the harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(3) In accordance with the Article 5(1) second subparagraph of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States are required to publish the reference numbers of national standards transposing harmonised standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(4) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), under mandate from the Commission, drew up and adopted the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 ‘Safety of toys — Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ on 15 July 1998, the references numbers of which were published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Communities of 28 July 1999 (3).
(5) On 16 September 2004, the European Committee for Standardisation adopted amendment 10 to the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 ‘Safety of toys — Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’. The references numbers of this amendment were published for the first time in the Official Journal of the European Union of 2 August 2005 (4).
(6) On 19 September 2005, the European Committee for Standardisation adopted the standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys — Part 1: mechanical and physical properties’ which is a consolidated version of the harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 and its 11 amendments. Amendment 10 is incorporated in the standard EN 71-1:2005.
(7) Amendment 10 aims to address the risks of suffocation presented by cup-shaped, bowl-shaped or one half of an egg-shaped toys having a nearly round, oval or elliptical opening which young children could place in front of their face when playing, therefore forming an airtight seal. The amendment excludes from its scope toys intended for drinking, such as tea sets cups.
(8) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 88/378/EEC, the French authorities have raised a formal objection in respect to the requirements on hemispheric toys, in particular, the exclusion of toys intended for drinking laid down in the standard EN 71-1:2005.
(9) The French authorities claim that the aim of the technical requirements provided for in the harmonised standard on hemispherical toys is to address the suffocation risks presented by certain toy shapes that can be placed over a child’s nose and mouth forming an airtight seal. Among these products are toys intended for drinking. These are toys which children are most likely to place over their mouths when playing and pretending to drink. Consequently, the French authorities claim that toys intended for drinking should be covered by the requirements on hemispheric toys of the harmonised standard EN 71-1:2005.
(10) According to the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) the standardisation on hemispheric toys was justified by incidents with infants playing with such toys in self-service restaurants. The work was based on a comprehensive investigation carried out in order to find the critical size and shapes of items to be addressed by the standardisation in relation to the children to be protected. As regards objects intended for drinking, e.g. tea set cups, CEN concluded that no incidents with these toys nor with real drinking cups have been registered. On the basis of these investigations CEN decided that there were no grounds to extend the standardisation work to this particular type of toys.
(11) At the request of the Commission, the Member States experts on the safety of toys informed the Commission of incidents caused by similar toys. The incidents are mentioned in a report published in the magazine ‘Pediatrics’, vol. 111, No 1, January 2003. In accordance with this report a total of 17 incidents were identified. In all cases investigated, children were found with the semi rigid object strongly adhering to their faces. Of the 17 incidents involved, 13 involved toys. These incidents concerned children between the ages of 4 and 36 months.
(12) Furthermore, the Commission was also informed of one non-fatal incident in USA, registered on the US Consumer Product Safety Commission on 27 October 2000. A two and a half year old child was found with a hard plastic toy cup stuck in her mouth and nose. This toy was included in a toy tea set.
(13) On the basis of the information submitted by the French authorities, the other national authorities and the Committee on standards and technical regulations it is founded that toys intended for drinking may present a risk of suffocation. Taking into account that these toys are excluded from the scope of the above mentioned standard, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Directive 88/378/EEC, Member States shall presume that the abovementioned toys satisfy the essential safety requirements only if they have an EC type examination certificate issued by a notified body,",['1391' '3646' '3648' '4036' '5235']

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Having consulted the Member States,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2001/95/EC and Council Directive 88/378/EEC of 3 May 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning the safety of toys (2), as amended by Council Directive 93/68/EEC (3), producers are obliged to place only safe toys on the market.
(2) Directive 88/378/EEC lays down the essential safety requirements that toys must meet to ensure the safety objectives of the Directive. In addition, the Directive provides that, in order to facilitate the proof of conformity with the essential safety requirements, European standards concerning the design and composition of toys should be drawn up by the standardisation bodies. Currently the risk posed by magnets is covered by the general safety requirement of Directive 88/378/EEC, but the Directive does not lay down particular safety requirements dealing with the risk posed by magnets.
(3) The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) issued European standard EN 71-1:2005 ‘Safety of toys — Part I: mechanical and physical properties’ which is a consolidated version of harmonised standard EN 71-1:1998 and its 11 amendments. Toys complying with the standard are presumed to be in conformity with the essential requirements of Directive 88/378/EEC, as far as the specific requirements covered by the standard are concerned. The standard does not currently contain technical requirements for magnetic toys. In accordance with Article 8(2)(a) of Directive 88/378/EEC, producers must have recourse to EC type-examination when a harmonised standard does not cover all the risks that a toy may present.
(4) In order to address the specific risks of magnetic toys, on 25 May 2007 the Commission gave a mandate to CEN (4), in accordance with Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (5), to revise the European standard EN 71-1:2005 within 24 months. Pending the drawing up and entry into force of the revised standard, it is necessary to address immediately the risks posed by magnetic toys in order to minimise further accidents to children caused by these toys by improving the knowledge of the risks.
(5) In addition to Directive 88/378/EEC, the safety of toys is covered by Directive 2001/95/EC which sets out the market surveillance framework for consumer products. According to Article 13 of Directive 2001/95/EC, if the European Commission becomes aware that certain products present a serious risk to the health and safety of consumers, it may, under certain conditions, adopt a decision requiring Member States to take temporary measures intended in particular to restrict or make subject to specific conditions the placing and making available on the market of such products.
(6) Such a decision may be adopted if (a) Member States differ significantly on the approach adopted or to be adopted to deal with the risk concerned; (b) the risk cannot, in view of the nature of the safety issue, be dealt with in a manner compatible with the degree of urgency of the case under other procedures laid down by the specific Community legislation applicable to the product concerned; and (c) the risk can be eliminated effectively only by adopting appropriate measures applicable at Community level, in order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of the health and safety of consumers and the proper functioning of the internal market.
(7) A serious risk has recently emerged concerning magnets in toys. Even though magnets have been used in toys for a long time, in the last few years they have become increasingly powerful and they can become detached more easily if attached using the same techniques as those employed in the past. Moreover, given their increased strength, loose magnets or magnetic parts used in toys now pose a higher risk of serious accidents than in the past.
(8) This serious risk has been established by a number of accidents that were reported worldwide in the course of 2006 and 2007 where children had swallowed magnets detached from toys or small parts of toys containing magnets. When more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other and may cause intestinal perforation, infection or blockage, which can be fatal. Inhalation of those magnets has also caused serious injuries, and aspiration into the lungs requires immediate surgery.
(9) Besides one fatal accident reported in the United States, several occurrences of children swallowing at least two magnets or a magnet and a metal object, and requiring major surgery, have been reported worldwide since 2006. These incidents have involved children aged between 10 months and 12 years.
(10) In 2006 and 2007, several toy producers launched major recalls of magnetic toys. In particular, over 18 million magnetic toys were recalled worldwide during the summer of 2007, and a significant proportion of these toys were on the European market. As a result of the accidents and the recent recalls, many producers have realised the risk and modified the design of the toys concerned, encapsulating or collaring the magnets in the parts containing them.
(11) Some countries have already adopted measures to deal with the risk. In particular, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) released, on 19 April 2007, a warning to parents concerning the health and safety risks posed by magnetic toys. The CPSC has also participated in the revision of ASTM F963-2007 ‘Standard Consumer Safety Specification on Toy Safety’ created under the auspices of the standardisation body, ASTM International, to deal with magnets in toys. In Europe, both France and Germany have informed the Commission of national measures.
(12) In its resolution of 26 September 2007 on the safety of products and particularly toys (6), the European Parliament urged the Commission to use its powers to take restrictive measures, including bans, if consumer goods placed on the Community market are found to be unsafe.
(13) Consultation of the Member States in the Committee set up by Article 15 of Directive 2001/95/EC has established that Member States differ significantly on the approach to deal with the risk posed by magnetic toys.
(14) In the absence of Community rules, some Member States have adopted or are about to adopt divergent national measures to manage the risk posed by magnetic toys. The introduction of such national measures will inevitably result in an uneven level of protection and in intra-Community barriers to trade in magnetic toys. Several Member States have called for a Community measure.
(15) There is Community legislation on small parts in toys meant for small children (7), but that legislation does not deal specifically and sufficiently with risks from magnetic toys to children who are over three years of age. In view of the nature of the hazard, the risk posed by magnetic toys cannot be dealt with effectively under other procedures laid down in specific rules of Community law in a manner compatible with the degree of urgency of the case. It is therefore necessary to have recourse to a temporary decision under Article 13 of Directive 2001/95/EC until the revised European standard EN 71-1:2005 provides a comprehensive solution to the problem identified. The targeted measure introduced by this Decision offers only a partial, temporary, short-term solution. The Commission has already clearly recognised the need for constructional requirements to deal adequately with the risks posed by magnetic toys when issuing the standardisation mandate to CEN to revise EN 71-1:2005.
(16) In view of the serious risk from magnetic toys, and in order to ensure a consistent and high level of consumer health and safety protection throughout the EU as well as to avoid barriers to trade, it is urgent that a temporary decision pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2001/95/EC be adopted. Such a decision should rapidly make the placing and making available on the market of magnetic toys subject to the condition that they are marked with an adequate warning of the risks linked to the presence of magnets or magnetic components of ingestible shape and size that are accessible to children. Such a decision should contribute to the prevention of further deaths and injuries.
(17) In the light of the accident and hazard data and the pending permanent measure in the form of the revision of standard EN 71-1:2005, the scope of this Decision should cover magnetic toys.
(18) This Decision is without prejudice to Articles 3(4) and 6 to 8 of Directive 2001/95/EC, and thus does not bar Member States from taking appropriate measures where there is evidence that a magnetic toy is dangerous, regardless of the conformity with the requirements in this Decision and other criteria designed to ensure the general safety requirement. Member States must carry out market surveillance and enforcement activities to prevent risks posed by unsafe products to the health and safety of consumers.
(19) On the basis of the progress made with the revision of the European standard EN 71-1:2005 and with regard to the completeness of the revised standard and its adequacy to address fully the risks posed by magnetic toys, the Commission will decide whether to extend the validity of this Decision for additional periods and whether the Decision should be amended. In particular, the Commission will decide whether to introduce constructional requirements to supplement the warning required in this Decision.
(20) A short transition period is necessary in the interests of both the Member States who must ensure that the Decision will be applied efficiently and also of the producers and distributors of magnetic toys who are subject to the obligation to place or make available on the market only magnetic toys that bear the appropriate warning. In this case, the shortest possible transition period should be laid down, consistent with the need to prevent further accidents and to ensure proportionality, taking into account that the measure consists of a marking only and does not require changes to the product design itself. Therefore, the requirement for a warning to be affixed to magnetic toys should apply shortly after the adoption of this Decision by the Commission.
(21) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 15 of Directive 2001/95/EC,",['1391' '1425' '2081' '2836' '3865' '4036']

Having regard to Directive 2009/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the safety of toys (1), and in particular Article 46(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure a high level of protection of children against risks caused by chemical substances in toys, Directive 2009/48/EC establishes certain requirements with regard to chemical substances such as those classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR) under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), allergenic fragrances and certain elements. In addition, Directive 2009/48/EC empowers the Commission to adopt specific limit values for chemicals used in toys which are intended for children under 36 months and in other toys intended to be placed in the mouth in order to ensure adequate protection in the case of toys involving a high degree of exposure. The adoption of such limit values takes the form of an inclusion in Appendix C to Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC.
(2) For a number of chemicals, currently applicable limit values are either too high in the light of available scientific evidence or do not exist. Specific limit values should therefore be adopted for them, taking into account the packaging requirements for food as well as the differences between toys and food contact materials.
(3) In order to advise the European Commission in the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives in the area of toy safety, the Commission established the Expert Group on Toys Safety. The mission of its subgroup ‘Chemicals’ is to provide such advice with regard to chemical substances which may be used in toys.
(4) 1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one, BIT, CAS number 2634-33-5) is used as a preservative in water-based toys (3) including hobby paints and finger paints (4), as shown by the results of a market survey involving economic operators and their trade associations, consumer representatives and allergy centres as well as through internet searches and shop visits (5).
(5) In its deliberations about BIT the subgroup ‘Chemicals’ took as a basis the related opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) noting that BIT is a well-documented contact allergen (6). Although the opinion considers BIT as only a moderate sensitiser with a lower potency than other marketed cosmetic preservatives (7), it concludes that isothiazolinones are important contact allergens for the consumer in Europe (8). The use of BIT in cosmetics is not allowed (9).
(6) BIT is classified under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 as a skin sensitiser. Directive 2009/48/EC has currently no specific limit value for BIT, nor a general limit value for sensitisers.
(7) In the light of the above, the subgroup ‘Chemicals’ considered that BIT should not be used in toys. In accordance with European Standard EN 71-9:2005+A1:2007, substances not to be used should be limited to the limit of quantification (LOQ) of an appropriate test method (10). Accordingly the subgroup ‘Chemicals’ recommended, at its meeting of 26 March 2014, that BIT in toys be limited to its LOQ, namely to a maximum concentration of 5 mg/kg. The use of BIT is not regulated for food contact materials.
(8) In view of the above, Appendix C of Annex II to Directive 2009/48/EC should be amended to include a content limit for BIT in toys.
(9) The content limit laid down by this Directive should be reviewed at the latest five years after the date on which Member States are to apply this Directive.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 47 of Directive 2009/48/EC,",['1391' '2739' '3646' '3730' '4036' '4308' '5234' '5235' '758']

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 85 thereof;
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 (1) of 6 February 1962, and in particular Article 2 thereof;
Having regard to the notification submitted as a precaution only on 31 January 1963 pursuant to Regulation No 17 by ""Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH"", a company established under German law at Frankfurt-on-Main (Germany), in respect of standard contracts for the sale of photographic products which it applied on the German domestic market;
Having regard to the publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities No C 122 of 24 November 1972 of the Summary of the notification pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17;
Having regard to the Opinion delivered on 27 March 1973 by the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Monopolies pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation No 17;
I
Whereas the notification submitted as a precaution only by Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH in 1963 concerned contracts regularly awarded by that company since 1958 in Germany to specialized dealers, both wholesale and retail, wishing to sell one or more categories of the products it then manufactured (photographic films, paper and equipment ; photochemical products ; sensitive products for radiography ; accessories, etc);
Whereas under the terms of those standard contracts, concluded for a year with tacit renewal, German dealers undertook to observe strictly Adox's general conditions of sale for the category of products concerned, on pain of their deliveries being stopped, their annual rebates being withheld or financial penalties being imposed ; whereas in particular they expressly agreed to respect the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer and to ensure that these were respected by others ; whereas Adox, for its part, undertook to apply without exception its system of fixed prices, as provided for in the German law;
Whereas Adox's general conditions of sale, as they stood in 1963, included in particular:    (a) the requirement that both wholesalers and retailers should strictly apply the resale prices fixed by the manufacturer for each group of purchasers, irrespective of the origin of the products, and that they should not grant any discount whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly;
(b) the requirement that wholesalers should only supply retailers in Germany able to provide service to the branch's usual customers and who in turn should undertake to comply with the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer;
(c) the requirement that retailers should deliver only to consumers, to the exclusion of any other dealer, and that they should not sell abroad without the manufacturer's permission;
Whereas in November 1969 the applicant company - which had meanwhile become Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH - discontinued of its own accord the fixed price system which it had been using on the German market and amended its general conditions of sale, in particular by abolishing the export ban imposed on its German dealers ; whereas in February 1971, following an intervention by the Commission, it also abolished the bans on wholesalers reselling to other wholesalers and on retailers reselling to other retailers;  (1)OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62 ; OJ Special edition 1959-62, November 1972, p. 87.
Whereas these general conditions of sale, thus amended, are being applied for products supplied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH which, in July 1971, took over Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH ; whereas cameras are no longer included in those products as the latter company ceased to manufacture them in 1965;
Whereas the Commission has not received any comments from third parties in response to the publication of the summary of the notification;
II
Whereas, under Article 2 of Regulation No 17, a negative clearance may be granted if the Commission finds, on the basis of facts in its possession, that there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty for action on its part in respect of the standard contracts and general conditions of sale in question;
Whereas those standard distribution contracts, as well as the general conditions of sale, which are of course subject to agreement between the supplier and each of its purchasers, are agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article 85;
Whereas the standard distribution contracts which were concluded between specialized dealers and Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH, Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH or Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH no longer contain any obligation apart from the undertaking entered into by dealers to observe the manufacturer's general conditions of sale;
Whereas the present wording of ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Photochemical Products"" and ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Equipment and Spare Parts"" applied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH both contain similar clauses relating, inter alia, to the placing of orders, the way of quoting prices, consignments, retention of ownership, conditions of payment, complaints, place of jurisdiction, etc.;
Whereas the conditions of sale for photochemical products contain the additional requirement that dealers should provide customers with the usual service of the branch and supply articles only in their original packaging ; whereas the conditions of sale for equipment and spare parts also stipulate that the warranty against manufacturing defects shall in all cases extend over a period of six months;
Whereas none of the aforementioned clauses is a direct or indirect restriction against competition among either distributors or consumers within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty ; whereas in particular, dealers, whether wholesale or retail, may deliver their goods to any purchasers, including purchasers outside German territory, at prices which they themselves have freely determined;
Whereas, consequently, the facts in the possession of the Commission do not show that the standard contracts and conditions of sale in question have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the Common Market within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty ; whereas, since one of the conditions for applying that paragraph is not satisfied, negative clearance may be granted;
III
Whereas the standard contracts and conditions of sale as worded prior to February 1971 fell within the provisions of Article 85 (1) because they contained clauses which restricted competition and which might affect trade between Member States, in particular:    (a) a ban on exporting by wholesalers and retailers without the manufacturer's permission;
(b) a ban on resales at the same level of distribution, as regards exports within the EEC;
(c) a requirement to respect prices fixed by the manufacturer, as regards goods re-imported into Germany from other Member States of the EEC;
Whereas such clauses, which were the only ones prohibited under Article 85 (1) and were unlikely to be exempted under the provisions of Article 85 (3), were finally all eliminated in February 1971;
Whereas the agreements in question consequently satisfy the requirements of Article 7 (1) of Regulation No 17 ; whereas, in fact, those agreements, which were in existence when the said Regulation No 17 (13 March 1962) entered into force and which were notified within the time limits fixed in Article 5 (1) of that Regulation, do not satisfy the requirements of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty, but whereas Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH has amended the said agreements so that they no longer fall within the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) ; whereas, as far as the versions of the contracts prior to modifications are concerned, the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) applies only to the period fixed by the Commission;
Whereas in this respect account should be taken of the fact that the abovementioned company abolished of its own accord two of the three restricitive clauses mentioned above and abolished the third clause as soon as the Commission so requested ; whereas these circumstances are sufficient to justify the non-application of the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) for the entire period preceding the amendments;",['1318' '1416' '3821' '4663' '478']

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) thereof,
After consulting the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/95/EC obliges producers to place only safe products on the market.
(2) Under the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, a product shall be presumed safe, as far as the risks and risk categories covered by the relevant national standards are concerned, when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards, the references of which have been published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union, in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Directive.
(3) Pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Directive, European standards are established by European standardisation bodies under mandates drawn up by the Commission.
(4) Pursuant to Article 4(2), the Commission is to publish the references of such standards.
(5) In June 2008, the Commission issued Mandate M/425 to CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) to draft a European safety standard to address the fire risk of cigarettes.
(6) CEN adopted standard EN 16156:2010 ‘Cigarettes — Assessment of the ignition propensity — Safety requirement’ in response to the Commission’s mandate. That standard refers to standard EN ISO 12863:2010 ‘Standard test method for assessing the ignition propensity of cigarettes’. Therefore, reference should also be made to the EN ISO standard when publishing the reference to EN 16156:2010.
(7) EN ISO 12863:2010 was amended by a technical corrigendum (3). The corrigendum was endorsed by CEN without any modification (4) and thus included in standard EN 16156:2010.
(8) Standards EN 16156:2010 and EN ISO 12863:2010 fulfil Mandate M/425 and comply with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC. Their references should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(9) In order to ensure a successful introduction of the standards, industry should be given sufficient time to adapt their production to the safety level provided for in the standards. The publication of the references of the standards in the Official Journal of the European Union 12 months after the standards were made available on 17 November 2010 by CEN is intended to ensure that thereafter in all Member States the presumption of fire safety would be based on common criteria. In order to ensure clarity and legal certainty on the internal market, market surveillance authorities in all Member States should take into account the European standards mentioned in recital 8 when assessing the fire safety of cigarettes, including at the stage of cigarette sales to consumers.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Directive 2001/95/EC,",['1395' '3646' '3648' '4036' '4076' '5234']
