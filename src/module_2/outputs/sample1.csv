DIRECTIVE 98/84/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 20 November 1998
on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 57(2), 66 and 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),
(1) Whereas the objectives of the Community as laid down in the Treaty include creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe and ensuring economic and social progress, by eliminating the barriers which divide them;
(2) Whereas the cross-border provision of broadcasting and information society services may contribute, from the individual point of view, to the full effectiveness of freedom of expression as a fundamental right and, from the collective point of view, to the achievement of the objectives laid down in the Treaty;
(3) Whereas the Treaty provides for the free movement of all services which are normally provided for remuneration; whereas this right, as applied to broadcasting and information society services, is also a specific manifestation in Community law of a more general principle, namely freedom of expression as enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; whereas that Article explicitly recognizes the right of citizens to receive and impart information regardless of frontiers and whereas any restriction of that right must be based on due consideration of other legitimate interests deserving of legal protection;
(4) Whereas the Commission undertook a wide-ranging consultation based on the Green Paper ‘Legal Protection of Encrypted Services in the Internal Market’; whereas the results of that consultation confirmed the need for a Community legal instrument ensuring the legal protection of all those services whose remuneration relies on conditional access;
(5) Whereas the European Parliament, in its Resolution of 13 May 1997 on the Green Paper (4), called on the Commission to present a proposal for a Directive covering all encoded services in respect of which encoding is used to ensure payment of a fee, and agreed that this should include information society services provided at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a service receiver, as well as broadcasting services;
(6) Whereas the opportunities offered by digital technologies provide the potential for increasing consumer choice and contributing to cultural pluralism, by developing an even wider range of services within the meaning of Articles 59 and 60 of the Treaty; whereas the viability of those services will often depend on the use of conditional access in order to obtain the remuneration of the service provider; whereas, accordingly, the legal protection of service providers against illicit devices which allow access to these services free of charge seems necessary in order to ensure the economic viability of the services;
(7) Whereas the importance of this issue was recognized by the Commission Communication on ‘A European Initiative in Electronic Commerce’;
(8) Whereas, in accordance with Article 7a of the Treaty, the internal market is to comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of services and goods is ensured; whereas Article 128(4) of the Treaty requires the Community to take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty; whereas by virtue of Article 130(3) of the Treaty, the Community must, through the policies and activities it pursues, contribute to creating the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of its industry;
(9) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to possible future Community or national provisions meant to ensure that a number of broadcasting services, recognized as being of public interest, are not based on conditional access;
(10) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the cultural aspects of any further Community action concerning new services;
(11) Whereas the disparity between national rules concerning the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access is liable to create obstacles to the free movement of services and goods;
(12) Whereas the application of the Treaty is not sufficient to remove these internal market obstacles; whereas those obstacles should therefore be removed by providing for an equivalent level of protection between Member States; whereas this implies an approximation of the national rules relating to the commercial activities which concern illicit devices;
(13) Whereas it seems necessary to ensure that Member States provide appropriate legal protection against the placing on the market, for direct or indirect financial gain, of an illicit device which enables or facilitates without authority the circumvention of any technological measures designed to protect the remuneration of a legally provided service;
(14) Whereas those commercial activities which concern illicit devices include commercial communications covering all forms of advertising, direct marketing, sponsorship, sales promotion and public relations promoting such products and services;
(15) Whereas those commercial activities are detrimental to consumers who are misled about the origin of illicit devices; whereas a high level of consumer protection is needed in order to fight against this kind of consumer fraud; whereas Article 129a(l) of the Treaty provides that the Community should contribute to the achievement of a high level of consumer protection by the measures it adopts pursuant to Article 100a thereof;
(16) Whereas, therefore, the legal framework for the creation of a single audiovisual area laid down in Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (5) should be supplemented with reference to conditional access techniques as laid down in this Directive, in order, not least, to ensure equal treatment of the suppliers of cross-border broadcasts, regardless of their place of establishment;
(17) Whereas, in accordance with the Council Resolution of 29 June 1995 on the effective uniform application of Community law and on the penalties applicable for breaches of Community law in the internal market (6), Member States are required to take action to ensure that Community law is duly applied with the same effectiveness and thoroughness as national law;
(18) Whereas, in accordance with Article 5 of the Treaty, Member States are required to take all appropriate measures to guarantee the application and effectiveness of Community law, in particular by ensuring that the sanctions chosen are effective, dissuasive and proportionate and the remedies appropriate;
(19) Whereas the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States should be limited to what is needed in order to achieve the objectives of the internal market, in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in the third paragraph of Article 3b of the Treaty;
(20) Whereas the distribution of illicit devices includes transfer by any means and putting such devices on the market for circulation inside or outside the Community;
(21) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the application of any national provisions which may prohibit the private possession of illicit devices, to the application of Community competition rules and to the application of Community rules concerning intellectual property rights;
(22) Whereas national law concerning sanctions and remedies for infringing commercial activities may provide that the activities have to be carried out in the knowledge or with reasonable grounds for knowing that the devices in question were illicit;
(23) Whereas the sanctions and remedies provided for under this Directive are without prejudice to any other sanction or remedy for which provision may be made under national law, such as preventive measures in general or seizure of illicit devices; whereas Member States are not obliged to provide criminal sanctions for infringing activities covered by this Directive; whereas Member States' provisions for actions for damages are to be be in conformity with their national legislative and judicial systems;
(24) Whereas this Directive is without prejudice to the application of national rules which do not fall within the field herein coordinated, such as those adopted for the protection of minors, including those in compliance with Directive 89/552/EEC, or national provisions concerned with public policy or public security,",['3021' '3646' '453' '516' '5235']

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), first subparagraph, in conjunction with Article 218(5) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 16 July 1999, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate within the Council of Europe, on behalf of the European Community, a convention concerning the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access.
(2) The European Convention on the legal protection of services based on, or consisting of, conditional access (‘the Convention’) was adopted by the Council of Europe on 24 January 2001.
(3) The Convention establishes a regulatory framework which is almost identical to that set out in Directive 98/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1).
(4) The Convention entered into force on 1 July 2003 and is open for signature by the Union.
(5) The signing of the Convention could help to extend the application of provisions similar to those in Directive 98/84/EC beyond the borders of the Union, and establish a law on services based on conditional access which would be applicable throughout the European continent.
(6) The Convention should be signed on behalf of the Union subject to its conclusion at a later date,",['1366' '3021' '3347' '3466' '3472' '4131' '5192']

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 30 October 2014
on the equivalence of the regulatory framework of Australia for central counterparties to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories
(2014/755/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The procedure for recognition of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) established in third countries set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 aims to allow CCPs established and authorised in third countries whose regulatory standards are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the Union. That recognition procedure and the equivalence decision provided for therein thus contribute to the achievement of the overarching aim of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 to reduce systemic risk by extending the use of safe and sound CCPs to clear over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts, including where those CCPs are established and authorised in a third country.
(2) In order for a third country legal regime to be considered equivalent to the legal regime of the Union in respect of CCPs, the substantial outcome of the applicable legal and supervisory arrangements should be equivalent to Union requirements in respect of the regulatory objectives they achieve. The purpose of this equivalence assessment is therefore to verify that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs established and authorised therein do not expose clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to a higher level of risk than the latter could be exposed to by CCPs authorised in the Union and, consequently, do not pose unacceptable levels of systemic risk in the Union.
(3) On 1 September 2013, the Commission received the technical advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) on the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia. The technical advice concludes that all of the provisions in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are replicated by corresponding legally binding requirements which are applicable, at a jurisdictional level, to CCPs authorised in Australia.
(4) In accordance with Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, three conditions need to be fulfilled in order to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country regarding CCPs authorised therein are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation.
(5) According to the first condition, CCPs authorised in a third country must comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(6) The legally binding requirements of Australia for CCPs authorised therein consist of the Corporations Act 2001 (‘Corporations Act’), which together with the Corporations Regulations 2001 (‘Corporations Regulations’), establish the legal framework for clearing and settlement facilities (‘CS facilities’). Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act provides that before granting a licence to carry out the activities of clearing or settlement, the Minister must be satisfied, among other things, that the CCP concerned has adequate operating rules and procedures which conform to the applicable laws and regulations to ensure, as far as it is reasonably practicable, that systemic risk is reduced and that the CCP is operated in a fair and effective manner. The CCP must also have adequate arrangements for handling conflicts of interest and for enforcing its internal rules and procedures. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (‘RBA’) advise the Minister regarding the granting of CS facilities' licences and changes of their internal rules and procedures, and are in charge of assessing, and in the case of ASIC of enforcing, CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act.
(7) ASIC provides regulatory guidance to regulated entities to explain specific issues already covered by legislation. In particular, ASIC revised its regulatory guidance on licensing and oversight of CS facilities' licences in December 2012 under the updated Regulatory Guide 211 ‘Clearing and settlement facilities: Australian and overseas operators’ (‘RG 211’). ASIC's RG 211 implements the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (‘PFMIs’) issued in April 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2) (‘CPSS’) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (‘IOSCO’), which are relevant for the obligations set out in the Corporations Act, and provides guidance to CCPs on how to comply with their obligations under the Corporations Act. Therefore, failure to comply with the Corporations Act as explained in RG 211 could entail enforcement action and sanctioning measures.
(8) RBA has the power, under the Corporations Act, to determine financial stability standards for the purpose of ensuring that CCPs operate in a way that causes or promotes the overall stability of the Australian financial system. In particular, in November 2012, RBA's Payments System Board approved the determination of new financial stability standards, the Financial Stability Standards for Central Counterparties (‘FSS’), which comprise 21 standards for CCPs, with accompanying sub-standards and guidance. Other than certain sub-standards, which came into effect on 31 March 2014, the FSS became effective in March 2013. The FSS are to be complied with by all licensed CCPs.
(9) The core principles for CS facilities set out in Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under ASIC's RG 211, and the FSS determined by RBA (together ‘the primary rules’), set out the high-level standards with which CCPs must comply in order to obtain authorisation to provide clearing services in Australia. Those primary rules comprise the first tier of the legally binding requirements in Australia. In order to comply with the primary rules, CCPs adopt, in addition, their internal rules and procedures which must conform with the specific requirements set out in the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under RG 211, and the FSS, which are submitted to the Minister prior to authorisation as a CS facility. Changes to the internal rules and procedures of CCPs must be notified to the Minister. The Minister can disallow changes in the internal rules and procedures of CCPs. The internal rules and procedures of CCPs have the effect of a contract and are legally binding on CCPs and their respective participants.
(10) The legally binding requirements set out in the primary rules applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia deliver substantial results equivalent to those of the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs authorised therein comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(12) According to the second condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein must provide for effective supervision and enforcement of those CCPs on an ongoing basis.
(13) CCPs authorised in Australia are subject to on-going supervision and oversight by ASIC and RBA. ASIC is responsible for enforcing CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act and in this respect, it conducts periodic assessments of compliance by CCPs with their licence obligations, other than their obligations relating to FSS and systemic risk reduction, and in particular with their duty to operate in a fair and effective manner to the extent it is reasonable to do so, and submits a report to the Minister, which is published. RBA monitors compliance by CCPs with their obligations under their respective licences and relating to financial stability and reduction of systemic risk, conducts periodic assessments of compliance by each CCP with the FSS and submits a report to the Minister, which is also published. CCPs authorised in Australia may receive written directions from the Minister and from ASIC. If a CCP fails to comply with a written direction, ASIC may apply to the courts which may order the CCP to comply with the written direction.
(14) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein provide for effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis.
(15) According to the third condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia must include an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CCPs authorised under third country legal regimes (‘third country CCPs’).
(16) Third country CCPs may apply for an ‘overseas clearing and settlement facility licence’ (‘an overseas CCP licence’) enabling them to provide in Australia some or all of the clearing services they are authorised to provide in their home country.
(17) The criteria applied to third country CCPs applying for an overseas CCP licence in Australia are comparable to those provided for third country CCPs applying for recognition under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. As a prerequisite for recognition, the regulatory regime of the third country in which the CCP is authorised must be deemed ‘sufficiently equivalent’, in relation to the degree of protection from systemic risk and level of effectiveness and fairness of services it achieves, to the Australian regulatory regime for comparable domestic CCPs. The assessment of ‘sufficient equivalence’ involves similar considerations as those assessed under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The establishment of cooperation arrangements between the Australian authorities and the relevant foreign supervisory authorities is also required to grant an overseas CCP licence.
(18) It should therefore be considered that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia provide for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of third country CCPs.
(19) The conditions laid down in Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 can therefore be considered to be met by the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia regarding CCPs authorised therein and those legal and supervisory arrangements should be considered to be equivalent to the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The Commission, informed by ESMA, should continue monitoring the evolution of the Australian legal and supervisory framework for CCPs and the fulfilment of the conditions on the basis of which this decision has been taken.
(20) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,",['1459' '171' '189' '3246' '4160' '4347' '4491']

of 5 April 1993
on unfair terms in consumer contracts
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 A thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas it is necessary to adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market before 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which goods, persons, services and capital move freely;
Whereas the laws of Member States relating to the terms of contract between the seller of goods or supplier of services, on the one hand, and the consumer of them, on the other hand, show many disparities, with the result that the national markets for the sale of goods and services to consumers differ from each other and that distortions of competition may arise amongst the sellers and suppliers, notably when they sell and supply in other Member States;
Whereas, in particular, the laws of Member States relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts show marked divergences;
Whereas it is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that contracts concluded with consumers do not contain unfair terms;
Whereas, generally speaking, consumers do not know the rules of law which, in Member States other than their own, govern contracts for the sale of goods or services; whereas this lack of awareness may deter them from direct transactions for the purchase of goods or services in another Member State;
Whereas, in order to facilitate the establishment of the internal market and to safeguard the citizen in his role as consumer when acquiring goods and services under contracts which are governed by the laws of Member States other than his own, it is essential to remove unfair terms from those contracts;
Whereas sellers of goods and suppliers of services will thereby be helped in their task of selling goods and supplying services, both at home and throughout the internal market; whereas competition will thus be stimulated, so contributing to increased choice for Community citizens as consumers;
Whereas the two Community programmes for a consumer protection and information policy (4) underlined the importance of safeguarding consumers in the matter of unfair terms of contract; whereas this protection ought to be provided by laws and regulations which are either harmonized at Community level or adopted directly at that level;
Whereas in accordance with the principle laid down under the heading ‘Protection of the economic interests of the consumers’, as stated in those programmes: ‘acquirers of goods and services should be protected against the abuse of power by the seller or supplier, in particular against one-sided standard contracts and the unfair exclusion of essential rights in contracts’;
Whereas more effective protection of the consumer can be achieved by adopting uniform rules of law in the matter of unfair terms; whereas those rules should apply to all contracts concluded between sellers or suppliers and consumers; whereas as a result inter alia contracts relating to employment, contracts relating to succession rights, contracts relating to rights under family law and contracts relating to the incorporation and organization of companies or partnership agreements must be excluded from this Directive;
Whereas the consumer must receive equal protection under contracts concluded by word of mouth and written contracts regardless, in the latter case, of whether the terms of the contract are contained in one or more documents;
Whereas, however, as they now stand, national laws allow only partial harmonization to be envisaged; whereas, in particular, only contractual terms which have not been individually negotiated are covered by this Directive; whereas Member States should have the option, with due regard for the Treaty, to afford consumers a higher level of protection through national provisions that are more stringent than those of this Directive;
Whereas the statutory or regulatory provisions of the Member States which directly or indirectly determine the terms of consumer contracts are presumed not to contain unfair terms; whereas, therefore, it does not appear to be necessary to subject the terms which reflect mandatory statutory or regulatory provisions and the principles or provisions of international conventions to which the Member States or the Community are party; whereas in that respect the wording ‘mandatory statutory or regulatory provisions’ in Article 1 (2) also covers rules which, according to the law, shall apply between the contracting parties provided that no other arrangements have been established;
Whereas Member States must however ensure that unfair terms are not included, particularly because this Directive also applies to trades, business or professions of a public nature;
Whereas it is necessary to fix in a general way the criteria for assessing the unfair character of contract terms;
Whereas the assessment, according to the general criteria chosen, of the unfair character of terms, in particular in sale or supply activities of a public nature providing collective services which take account of solidarity among users, must be supplemented by a means of making an overall evaluation of the different interests involved; whereas this constitutes the requirement of good faith; whereas, in making an assessment of good faith, particular regard shall be had to the strength of the bargaining positions of the parties, whether the consumer had an inducement to agree to the term and whether the goods or services were sold or supplied to the special order of the consumer; whereas the requirement of good faith may be satisfied by the seller or supplier where he deals fairly and equitably with the other party whose legitimate interests he has to take into account;
Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, the annexed list of terms can be of indicative value only and, because of the cause of the minimal character of the Directive, the scope of these terms may be the subject of amplification or more restrictive editing by the Member States in their national laws;
Whereas the nature of goods or services should have an influence on assessing the unfairness of contractual terms;
Whereas, for the purposes of this Directive, assessment of unfair character shall not be made of terms which describe the main subject matter of the contract nor the quality/price ratio of the goods or services supplied; whereas the main subject matter of the contract and the price/quality ratio may nevertheless be taken into account in assessing the fairness of other terms; whereas it follows, inter alia, that in insurance contracts, the terms which clearly define or circumscribe the insured risk and the insurer's liability shall not be subject to such assessment since these restrictions are taken into account in calculating the premium paid by the consumer;
Whereas contracts should be drafted in plain, intelligible language, the consumer should actually be given an opportunity to examine all the terms and, if in doubt, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail;
Whereas Member States should ensure that unfair terms are not used in contracts concluded with consumers by a seller or supplier and that if, nevertheless, such terms are so used, they will not bind the consumer, and the contract will continue to bind the parties upon those terms if it is capable of continuing in existence without the unfair provisions;
Whereas there is a risk that, in certain cases, the consumer may be deprived of protection under this Directive by designating the law of a non-Member country as the law applicable to the contract; whereas provisions should therefore be included in this Directive designed to avert this risk;
Whereas persons or organizations, if regarded under the law of a Member State as having a legitimate interest in the matter, must have facilities for initiating proceedings concerning terms of contract drawn up for general use in contracts concluded with consumers, and in particular unfair terms, either before a court or before an administrative authority competent to decide upon complaints or to initiate appropriate legal proceedings; whereas this possibility does not, however, entail prior verification of the general conditions obtaining in individual economic sectors;
Whereas the courts or administrative authorities of the Member States must have at their disposal adequate and effective means of preventing the continued application of unfair terms in consumer contracts,",['2836' '2897' '3193' '3299' '5492']

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005 on Community statistics concerning balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment.
(2) Due to the economic and technical developments in the area of balance of payments, it is necessary to regularly update the data requirements and to adapt the level of the breakdown laid down in Regulation (EC) No 184/2005.
(3) The adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 on the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector (2) has resulted in a need for additional balance of payments statistics.
(4) In order to improve the accuracy of aggregates for income and current account at the Community level, to ensure consistency between the aggregation method for Portfolio Investment Income (current account) and Portfolio Investment flows (financial account), and to ensure consistency between calculations of the European Commission (Eurostat) and those of the European Central Bank (ECB), it is necessary to introduce certain amendments of the data requirements in Table 1 ‘Balance of payments euro indicators’ and Table 2 ‘Balance of payments quarterly statistics’ of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005.
(5) The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union and the adoption of the euro by Slovenia, Cyprus, Malta and Slovakia require corresponding changes to be made in Table 6 ‘Geographical breakdown levels’ of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005.

DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
of 29 July 2010
on access to and use of certain TARGET2 data
(ECB/2010/9)
(2010/451/EU)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular to the first and fourth indents of Article 127(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular the first and fourth indents of Article 3.1, and Article 22 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Guideline ECB/2007/2 of 26 April 2007 on a Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system (TARGET2) (1) established TARGET2.
(2) TARGET2 functions on the basis of a single technical platform called the Single Shared Platform (SSP), operated by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banque de France and the Banca d’Italia (hereinafter the SSP-providing CBs). It is legally structured as a multiplicity of real-time gross settlement systems, each of which is a TARGET2 component operated by a Eurosystem central bank (CB). Guideline ECB/2007/2 harmonises the rules for the TARGET2 components to the greatest extent possible.
(3) The Eurosystem oversees TARGET2, with the ECB taking the lead.
(4) Article 38(1) of Annex II to Guideline ECB/2007/2 — the Harmonised Conditions for participation in TARGET2 (hereinafter the Harmonised Conditions) obliges each CB to keep confidential all sensitive or secret payment information belonging to participants holding TARGET2 accounts with that CB, unless the participant has given its written consent to disclosure or such disclosure is permitted or required under national law.
(5) Article 38(2) of the Harmonised Conditions nevertheless provides that participants agree that, provided such disclosure does not conflict with the applicable law, each CB may disclose payment information regarding the participant obtained in the course of the operation of the relevant TARGET2 component to: (i) other CBs or third parties that are involved in the operation of TARGET2, to the extent that this is necessary for the efficient functioning of TARGET2; or (ii) supervisory and oversight authorities of Member States and the Union, to the extent that this is necessary for the performance of their public tasks.
(6) Only when the use of aggregate TARGET2 payment data is not sufficient for the CBs to ensure the effective functioning of TARGET2, is it necessary for all CBs to have access to transaction-level data extracted from the SSP of the participants in all TARGET2 components, including indirect participants and addressable BIC holders. Access by all CBs to such transaction-level data also becomes necessary for the performance of the public tasks of the Eurosystem as overseer of TARGET2 when the use of aggregate TARGET2 payment data does not suffice.
(7) Such CB access to transaction-level data of all TARGET2 participants should be limited to what is necessary to enable the CBs, as operators and as overseers of TARGET2, to conduct quantitative analyses of transaction flows between TARGET2 participants or to make numerical simulations of the settlement process of TARGET2. Such CB access should exclude all information on the participants’ customers except where such customers are indirect participants or addressable BIC holders.
(8) When conducted by CBs in their capacity as operators of TARGET2, these quantitative analyses and numerical simulations should serve in particular the purposes of ensuring the efficiency of the design of TARGET2, monitoring the effects of its pricing mechanisms, and making cost-benefit analyses of additional features and services. When conducted by CBs in their capacity as overseers of TARGET2, they should serve in particular the purposes of analysing operational failures in TARGET2, analysing changes in payment patterns and timing, quantifying liquidity levels and settlement outcomes with decreased liquidity, making statistical and structural analyses of transaction flows, and supporting regular and ad-hoc oversight assessments against applicable standards.
(9) It is of the utmost importance to preserve the confidentiality of transaction-level data. For this purpose, access to and use of transaction-level data should be limited to a small group of designated staff members from the CBs. In addition to the rules on professional conduct and confidentiality applicable to CB staff members, the Payments and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC) of the European System of Central Banks should establish specific rules for access to and use of transaction-level data. CBs should ensure compliance with these rules by their designated staff members and the PSSC should monitor such compliance.
(10) The PSSC should have the option to publish information derived from the use of transaction-level data, provided that this information does not make it possible to identify participants or participants’ customers, whether directly or indirectly.
(11) In order to allow quantitative analyses and numerical simulations to be made using transaction-level data, the Eurosystem should establish a specific device, the TARGET2 Simulator.
(12) In addition to Article 38(2) of the Harmonised Conditions which covers transaction-level data, Article 38(3) of the Harmonised Conditions states more broadly that, provided it does not make it possible, whether directly or indirectly, to identify the participant or the participant’s customers, a CB may use, disclose or publish payment information regarding the participant or the participant’s customers for statistical, historical, scientific or other purposes in the exercise of the public functions of the CB or of functions of other public entities to whom the information is disclosed. Without prejudice to the ability of the CBs to use, disclose or publish such information under this Article, the PSSC should coordinate the actions of the CBs.
(13) Article 5 of Guideline ECB/2007/2 specifies the governance levels of TARGET2, including that the Governing Council is responsible for the direction, management and control of TARGET2 and that the PSSC assists the Governing Council as an advisory body in all matters related to TARGET2. Article 5 of Guideline ECB/2007/2 establishes further that the PSSC conducts the execution of the tasks assigned to the CBs in Guideline ECB/2007/2 within the general framework defined by the Governing Council. In this latter capacity, the PSSC is to conduct certain tasks under this Decision. A voting rule for the PSSC and the possibility for the Governing Council to review the PSSC’s decisions are necessary.
(14) The provisions of this Decision will be extended to apply to non-Eurosystem TARGET2-connected central banks by means of an agreement between these central banks and the Eurosystem,",['2220' '2510' '4763' '5315' '6151']

of 16 February 1998
on consumer protection in the indication of the prices of products offered to consumers
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 129a(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December 1997,
(1) Whereas transparent operation of the market and correct information is of benefit to consumer protection and healthy competition between enterprises and products;
(2) Whereas consumers must be guaranteed a high level of protection; whereas the Community should contribute thereto by specific action which supports and supplements the policy pursued by the Member States regarding precise, transparent and unambiguous information for consumers on the prices of products offered to them;
(3) Whereas the Council Resolution of 14 April 1975 on a preliminary programme of the European Economic Community for a consumer protection and information policy (4) and the Council Resolution of 19 May 1981 on a second programme of the European Economic Community for a consumer protection and information policy (5) provide for the establishment of common principles for indicating prices;
(4) Whereas these principles have been established by Directive 79/581/EEC concerning the indication of prices of certain foodstuffs (6) and Directive 88/314/EEC concerning the indication of prices of non-food products (7);
(5) Whereas the link between indication of the unit price of products and their pre-packaging in pre-established quantities or capacities corresponding to the values of the ranges adopted at Community level has proved overly complex to apply, whereas it is thus necessary to abandon this link in favour of a new simplified mechanism and in the interest of the consumer, without prejudice to the rules governing packaging standardisation;
(6) Whereas the obligation to indicate the selling price and the unit price contributes substantially to improving consumer information, as this is the easiest way to enable consumers to evaluate and compare the price of products in an optimum manner and hence to make informed choices on the basis of simple comparisons;
(7) Whereas, therefore, there should be a general obligation to indicate both the selling price and the unit price for all products except for products sold in bulk, where the selling price cannot be determined until the consumer indicates how much of the product is required;
(8) Whereas it is necessary to take into account the fact that certain products are customarily sold in quantities different from one kilogramme, one litre, one metre, one square metre or one cubic metre; whereas it is thus appropriate to allow Member States to authorise that the unit price refer to a different single unit of quantity, taking into account the nature of the product and the quantities in which it is customarily sold in the Member State concerned;
(9) Whereas the obligation to indicate the unit price may entail an excessive burden for certain small retail businesses under certain circumstances; whereas Member States should therefore be allowed to refrain from applying this obligation during an appropriate transitional period;
(10) Whereas Member States should also remain free to waive the obligation to indicate the unit price in the case of products for which such price indication would not be useful or would be liable to cause confusion for instance when indication of the quantity is not relevant for price comparison purposes, or when different products are marketed in the same packaging;
(11) Whereas in the case of non-food products, Member States, with a view to facilitating application of the mechanism implemented, are free to draw up a list of products or categories of products for which the obligation to indicate the unit price remains applicable;
(12) Whereas Community-level rules can ensure homogenous and transparent information that will benefit all consumers in the context of the internal market; whereas the new, simplified approach is both necessary and sufficient to achieve this objective;
(13) Whereas Member States must make sure that the system is effective; whereas the transparency of the system should also be maintained when the euro is introduced; whereas, to that end, the maximum number of prices to be indicated should be limited;
(14) Whereas particular attention should be paid to small retail businesses; whereas, to this end, the Commission should, in its report on the application of this Directive to be presented no later than three years after the date referred to in Article 11(1), take particular account of the experience gleaned in the application of the Directive by small retail businesses, inter alia, regarding technological developments and the introduction of the single currency, whereas this report, having regard to the transitional period referred to in Article 6, should be accompanied by a proposal,",['1425' '233' '2664' '3123' '3268' '5739']

","Commission Directive 2002/77/EC
of 16 September 2002
on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 86(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 90/388/EEC of 28 June 1990 on competition in the markets for telecommunications services(1), as last amended by Directive 1999/64/EC(2), has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interest of clarity.
(2) Article 86 of the Treaty entrusts the Commission with the task of ensuring that, in the case of public undertakings and undertakings enjoying special or exclusive rights, Member States comply with their obligations under Community law. Pursuant to Article 86(3), the Commission can specify and clarify the obligations arising from that Article and, in that framework, set out the conditions which are necessary to allow the Commission to perform effectively the duty of surveillance imposed upon it by that paragraph.
(3) Directive 90/388/EEC required Member States to abolish special and exclusive rights for the provision of telecommunications services, initially for other services than voice telephony, satellite services and mobile radiocommunications, and then it gradually established full competition in the telecommunications market.
(4) A number of other Directives in this field have also been adopted under Article 95 of the Treaty by the European Parliament and the Council aiming, principally, at the establishment of an internal market for telecommunications services through the implementation of open network provision and the provision of a universal service in an environment of open and competitive markets. Those Directives should be repealed with effect from 25 July 2003 when the new regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services is applied.
(5) The new electronic communications regulatory framework consists of one general Directive, Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)(3) and four specific Directives: Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)(4), Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)(5), Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)(6), and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) sector(7).
(6) In the light of the developments which have marked the liberalisation process and the gradual opening of the telecommunications markets in Europe since 1990, certain definitions used in Directive 90/388/EEC and its amending acts should be adjusted in order to reflect the latest technological developments in the telecommunications field, or replaced in order to take account of the convergence phenomenon which has shaped the information technology, media and telecommunications industries over recent years. The wording of certain provisions should, where possible, be clarified in order to facilitate their application, taking into account, where appropriate, the relevant Directives adopted under Article 95 of the Treaty, and the experience acquired through the implementation of Directive 90/388/EEC as amended.
(7) This Directive makes reference to ""electronic communications services"" and ""electronic communications networks"" rather than the previously used terms ""telecommunications services"" and ""telecommunications networks"". These new definitions are indispensable in order to take account of the convergence phenomenon by bringing together under one single definition all electronic communications services and/or networks which are concerned with the conveyance of signals by wire, radio, optical or other electromagnetic means (i.e. fixed, wireless, cable television, satellite networks). Thus, the transmission and broadcasting of radio and television programmes should be recognised as an electronic communication service and networks used for such transmission and broadcasting should likewise be recognised as electronic communications networks. Furthermore, it should be made clear that the new definition of electronic communications networks also covers fibre networks which enable third parties, using their own switching or routing equipment, to convey signals.
(8) In this context, it should be made clear that Member States must remove (if they have not already done so) exclusive and special rights for the provision of all electronic communications networks, not just those for the provision of electronic communications services and should ensure that undertakings are entitled to provide such services without prejudice to the provisions of Directives 2002/19/EC, 2002/20/EC, 2002/21/EC and 2002/22/EC. The definition of electronic communications networks should also mean that Member States are not permitted to restrict the right of an operator to establish, extend and/or provide a cable network on the ground that such network could also be used for the transmission of radio and television programming. In particular, special or exclusive rights which amount to restricting the use of electronic communications networks for the transmission and distribution of television signals are contrary to Article 86(1), read in conjunction with Article 43 (right of establishment) and/or Article 82(b) of the EC Treaty insofar as they have the effect of permitting a dominant undertaking to limit ""production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers"". This is, however, without prejudice to the specific rules adopted by the Member States in accordance with Community law, and, in particular, in accordance with Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989(8), on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(9), governing the distribution of audiovisual programmes intended for the general public.
(9) Pursuant to the principle of proportionality, Member States should no longer make the provision of electronic communications services and the establishment and provision of electronic communications networks subject to a licensing regime but to a general authorisation regime. This is also required by Directive 2002/20/EC, according to which electronic communications services or networks should be provided on the basis of a general authorisation and not on the basis of a license. An aggrieved party should have the right to challenge a decision preventing him from providing electronic communications services or networks before an independent body and, ultimately, before a court or a tribunal. It is a fundamental principle of Community law that an individual is entitled to effective judicial protection whenever a State measure violates rights conferred upon him by the provisions of a Directive.
(10) Public authorities may exercise a dominant influence on the behaviour of public undertakings, as a result either of the rules governing the undertaking or of the manner in which the shareholdings are distributed. Therefore, where Member States control vertically integrated network operators which operate networks which have been established under special or exclusive rights, those Member States should ensure that, in order to avoid potential breaches of the Treaty competition rules, such operators, when they enjoy a dominant position in the relevant market, do not discriminate in favour of their own activities. It follows that Member States should take all measures necessary to prevent any discrimination between such vertically integrated operators and their competitors.
(11) This Directive should also clarify the principle derived from Commission Directive 96/2/EC of 16 January 1996 amending Directive 90/388/EC with regard to mobile and personal communications(10), by providing that Member States should not grant exclusive or special rights of use of radio frequencies and that the rights of use of those frequencies should be assigned according to objective, non-discriminatory and transparent procedures. This should be without prejudice to specific criteria and procedures adopted by Member States to grant such rights to providers of radio or television broadcast content services with a view to pursuing general interest objectives in conformity with Community law.
(12) Any national scheme pursuant to Directive 2002/22/EC, serving to share the net cost of the provision of universal service obligations shall be based on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria and shall be consistent with the principles of proportionality and of least market distortion. Least market distortion means that contributions should be recovered in a way that as far as possible minimises the impact of the financial burden falling on end-users, for example by spreading contributions as widely as possible.
(13) Where rights and obligations arising from international conventions setting up international satellite organisations are not compatible with the competition rules of the Treaty, Member States should take, in accordance with Article 307 of the EC Treaty, all appropriate steps to eliminate such incompatibilities. This Directive should clarify this obligation because Article 3 of Directive 94/46/EC(11), merely required Member States to ""communicate to the Commission"" the information they possessed on such incompatibilities. Article 11 of this Directive should clarify the obligation on Member States to remove any restrictions which could still be in force because of those international conventions.
(14) This Directive should maintain the obligation imposed on Member States by Directive 1999/64/EC, so as to ensure that dominant providers of electronic communications networks and publicly available telephone services operate their public electronic communication network and cable television network as separate legal entities.
(15) This Directive should be without prejudice to obligations of the Member States concerning the time limits set out in Annex I, Part B, within which the Member States are to comply with the preceding Directives.
(16) Member States should supply to the Commission any information which is necessary to demonstrate that existing national implementing legislation reflects the clarifications provided for in this Directive as compared with Directives 90/388/EC, 94/46/EC, 95/51/EC(12), 96/2/EC, 96/19/EC(13) and 1999/64/EC.
(17) In the light of the above, Directive 90/388/EC should be repealed,",['2602' '30' '3010' '3017' '4361' '4424' '4428' '539' '6088' '6139']

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 (3) lays down the conditions under which the competent authorities in the Member States designated as responsible for the enforcement of the laws that protect consumers’ interests are to cooperate with each other and with the Commission in order to ensure compliance with those laws and the smooth functioning of the internal market, and in order to enhance the protection of consumers’ economic interests.
(2) Point (a) of Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 defines ‘the laws that protect consumers’ interests’ as the Directives, as transposed into the internal legal order of Member States, and the Regulations listed in the Annex to that Regulation (‘the Annex’).
(3) Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004, several of the legislative acts listed in the Annex have been repealed, and new legislation has been adopted.
(4) Directive 84/450/EEC (4) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/114/EC (5). The reference to Directive 84/450/EEC should therefore be removed from the Annex and replaced by a reference to the specific Articles of Directive 2006/114/EC which aim at protecting consumers’ interests.
(5) Whilst Directive 87/102/EEC (6) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/48/EC (7), Directive 2008/48/EC does not expressly state that references to the repealed Directive 87/102/EEC are to be construed as references to Directive 2008/48/EC. For reasons of legal certainty, the reference to Directive 87/102/EEC in the Annex should therefore be replaced by a reference to Directive 2008/48/EC.
(6) Directive 89/552/EEC (8) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2010/13/EU (9). Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 34 of Directive 2010/13/EU, references to Directive 89/552/EEC are to be construed as references to Directive 2010/13/EU. However, for the sake of clarity, the reference to Directive 89/552/EEC in the Annex should be replaced by a reference to the relevant Articles of Directive 2010/13/EU.
(7) Directive 93/13/EEC (10) was not amended by Decision 2002/995/EC (11). Therefore, the reference to that Decision should be removed from the Annex.
(8) Directive 94/47/EC (12) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/122/EC (13). Pursuant to the second paragraph of Article 18 of Directive 2008/122/EC, references to Directive 94/47/EC are to be construed as references to Directive 2008/122/EC. However, for the sake of clarity, the reference to Directive 94/47/EC in the Annex should be replaced by a reference to Directive 2008/122/EC.
(9) Directive 97/55/EC (14) is an amending Directive to the repealed Directive 84/450/EEC. Therefore, the reference to Directive 97/55/EC should be removed from the Annex.
(10) The Annex should be amended accordingly.
(11) It is necessary to assess the effectiveness and operational mechanisms of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and thoroughly examine the possible inclusion in the Annex of additional laws that protect consumers’ interests, with a view to a possible revision of that Regulation aimed at providing public enforcement authorities with improved means to effectively detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of infringements harming the collective interests of consumers in cross-border situations. To that end, the Commission should submit as soon as possible, and in any event by the end of 2014, a report to the European Parliament and to the Council, accompanied, where appropriate, by a legislative proposal,",['206' '2247' '226' '2836']
