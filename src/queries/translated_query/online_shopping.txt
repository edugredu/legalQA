A consumer, acting in the capacity of a natural person for purposes outside their trade, business, or profession, entered into a distance contract with an online commercial entity for the purchase of footwear. 
Payment was executed via credit card, and the seller issued an electronic confirmation stipulating a delivery period of five days. 
Despite the lapse of more than fourteen days since the transaction, the goods have not been delivered. 
Repeated attempts by the consumer to establish contact with the seller through electronic correspondence and digital communication platforms have been unsuccessful, resulting in a lack of response from the seller.

The consumer seeks a comprehensive legal assessment regarding:

    - The rights and remedies available under applicable consumer protection legislation governing distance contracts and e-commerce transactions, particularly in cases of non-delivery of goods.
    - The procedural mechanisms for obtaining reimbursement of the purchase price, including but not limited to chargeback processes through the payment service provider.
    - The appropriate administrative or judicial avenues for lodging complaints against non-compliant traders, including recourse to national consumer protection authorities or cross-border dispute resolution bodies.
    - The obligations imposed on the seller concerning delivery, communication, and redress under relevant statutory and regulatory frameworks.

The query requests a detailed exposition of the legal provisions and procedural steps that should be undertaken when an online trader fails to fulfill contractual delivery obligations and does not respond to consumer inquiries.
