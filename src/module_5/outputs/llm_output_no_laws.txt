Okay, I need to answer the user's question about the essential legal duties and compliance measures under GDPR for SMEs acting as data controllers or processors. Let me start by recalling what the GDPR requires. SMEs might find it tough to handle all the obligations, so breaking it down into manageable parts is key. 

First, I should explain that GDPR applies to any business handling EU residents' data, regardless of size. But the user specifically asked about SMEs, so maybe mention that some exemptions or scaled requirements exist. Wait, the GDPR does have some provisions that might differ based on company size. Let me check—Article 30 talks about record-keeping, but SMEs with fewer than 250 employees might not need to maintain records unless processing is regular, involves sensitive data, or affects individuals.

Next, the key obligations. The data controller is responsible for ensuring compliance, which includes lawfulness, transparency, and purpose limitation. Need to mention the legal basis for processing, like consent or legitimate interest. Consent must be explicit and easy to withdraw—especially important for SMEs. Then data minimization, storage limitation, security measures. Maybe encryption and pseudonymization? Also, appointing a Data Protection Officer if certain conditions apply, but SMEs might not have to if processing is occasional.

Breach notification is important. If there's a breach affecting individuals, they must report it within 72 hours. Then, individual rights: access, rectification, erasure, portability, objection. For SMEs, responding to access requests might be a big task, so they need a process. Also, Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) if processing poses high risks.

Compliance measures: data processing agreements with third parties, international transfers might require safeguards. Maybe explain the fines for non-compliance, but SMEs could have lower fines based on turnover. Also, the role of the lead supervisory authority if operating in multiple EU countries.

Now, structuring the answer logically. Start with applicability, then obligations as controllers and processors, specific compliance measures, handling breaches, individual rights, DPIAs, DPO requirements, record-keeping exemptions, fines, and international transfers. Use bullet points for clarity. Avoid jargon where possible, but some terms like "data minimization" or "DPIA" might be necessary, so explain them in simple terms.

Wait, the user mentioned both data controllers and processors. So the answer should address the duties for both roles. For example, processors have their own obligations like maintaining records and ensuring security. Also, SMEs might have to comply with the same rules but with some exceptions, as per their size. Need to clarify that.

I should also mention the six lawful bases for processing, like consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, and legitimate interests. For SMEs, legitimate interests could be relevant. Also, the accountability principle—controllers must be able to demonstrate compliance, which might be challenging for SMEs.

Consumer rights: access data, correct inaccuracies, right to be forgotten (if applicable), data portability, object to processing, and complain to authorities. SMEs need to respond within a month and free of charge.

Possible remedies if non-compliant: fines up to 4% of global turnover or €20 million, so that's a big deal. Steps for SMEs would be assessing data practices, appointing a DPO if needed, employee training, etc.

Wait, the user's task also mentions "other parties" obligations. Hmm, but the question is about SMEs as controllers or processors. The other parties might refer to data subjects (consumers) and perhaps data processors if they're outsourcing. Need to make sure that's covered.

Maybe start with applicability, then obligations for controllers, then processors, then compliance measures including DPA, breach notification, individual rights, record-keeping, DPO, DPIA, international transfers, and penalties. That structure flows logically.

Also, need to explain terms like data processor vs controller. Controller determines why and how data is processed, processor acts on their behalf. SMEs might be both depending on their role.

Let me make sure all points are covered without getting too technical. Prioritize clarity for a non-expert. Use examples where possible. For instance, when talking about data minimization, an SME should collect only necessary data, like a store only keeping customer email instead of their entire history unless needed.

Check if there's a checklist or something. The answer should be comprehensive but not overwhelming. Use sections with headings maybe, but since bullets are allowed, that's okay.

Potential pitfalls: confusing data controllers and processors, missing specific SME exceptions, or not explaining the consumer rights clearly. Also, ensuring that the possible remedies are addressed, like steps to take if they're non-compliant or if a breach happens.

Okay, time to structure the answer. Start with an introduction, then break down into key obligations for controllers and processors, compliance steps, breach handling, rights, and penalties. Highlight the SME-specific aspects like record-keeping exemptions. Make sure to use accessible language and bullet points where appropriate.

### Essential Legal Duties and Compliance Measures Under the GDPR for SMEs  

The **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** applies to all businesses handling the personal data of **European Union (EU) residents**, regardless of size. Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) must comply with its requirements unless specific exemptions apply. Below is a breakdown of key obligations and practical steps for SMEs acting as **data controllers** (those who decide why and how data is processed) or **data processors** (those who process data on behalf of controllers):  

---

#### **1. Key Obligations Under the GDPR**  
SMEs must adhere to core GDPR principles:  

- **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**:  
  - Process data only for *explicit, legitimate purposes* and ensure individuals are informed (e.g., via a clear privacy policy).  
  - For example, collect email addresses for order delivery only—not for marketing without consent.  

- **Purpose Limitation**:  
  - Do not use data for reasons not communicated to individuals initially.  

- **Data Minimisation**:  
  - Collect and retain only the data *strictly necessary* for your purpose.  
  - Example: A small online store needs an address and payment details but not a customer’s medical history.  

- **Storage Limitation**:  
  - Delete data once its purpose is fulfilled, unless legally required to retain it (e.g., tax records).  

- **Integrity and Confidentiality**:  
  - Implement *appropriate security measures* to protect data from breaches or loss. This could include encryption, access controls, or secure cloud storage.  

---

#### **2. Legal Bases for Processing Data**  
You must have at least **one valid reason** to process data:  
1. **Consent**: Explicit, freely given, and easy to withdraw (e.g., newsletter sign-ups).  
2. **Contract**: Necessary for fulfilling a service requested by the individual (e.g., shipping an order).  
3. **Legal Obligation**: Required by law (e.g., tax reporting).  
4. **Legitimate Interest**: Your business or a third party’s interests outweigh the individual’s privacy concerns (must document a “legitimate interest assessment”).  
   - Common for SMEs in areas like marketing or fraud prevention.  
5. **Vital Interest**: Protecting someone’s life (rare for most SMEs).  
6. **Public Task**: For public authorities (not typically applicable to SMEs).  

---

#### **3. Data Controller Responsibilities**  
As a data controller, your SME must:  
- Ensure all **data processors** (e.g., outsourced IT vendors) comply with GDPR.  
- Maintain records of processing activities **unless your business has fewer than 250 employees AND**:  
  - Processing rarely occurs,  
  - Does not involve sensitive data (e.g., health records or racial origin),  
  - Does not pose a risk to individuals.  
- Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** **if**:  
  - You process large amounts of sensitive data or conduct systematic monitoring (e.g., behavior tracking for ads),  
  - Your SME is a public authority.  
  - *Otherwise, no need for a DPO unless your main business involves high-risk data.*  

---

#### **4. Data Processor Responsibilities**  
If your SME processes data on behalf of others (e.g., managing a client’s customer database):  
- Only act on the controller’s documented instructions.  
- Keep detailed **processing records** (same exemption rules as above for ≤250 employees).  
- Ensure sub-contractors (e.g., cloud storage providers) are GDPR-compliant.  

---

#### **5. Responding to Individual Rights**  
All SMEs must respect **six fundamental rights** of data subjects:  
- **Access**: Individuals can request a copy of their data.  
- **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate or incomplete data.  
- **Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten)**: Delete data if there’s no compelling reason to retain it (e.g., when a customer closes an account).  
- **Restriction**: Pause processing in some cases (e.g., while resolving a dispute).  
- **Portability**: Allow individuals to receive their data in a usable format or transfer it to another provider.  
- **Objection**: Stop processing based on legitimate interests unless overriding grounds exist (e.g., for direct marketing).  

**Practical Tip**: Create templates for responding to requests quickly. Responses must be provided **within one month** and free of charge (unless requests are excessive).  

---

#### **6. Data Breach Management**  
- Notify your local Data Protection Authority (DPA) **within 72 hours** if a breach risks individuals’ rights (e.g., leaked credit card details).  
- Inform affected individuals **if the risk is severe** (e.g., identity theft).  

---

#### **7. Accountability and Record-Keeping**  
- Document how and why data is used. Larger SMEs must keep formal records, but smaller ones (≤250 employees) can focus on high-risk processing.  
- Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** for high-risk activities (e.g., profiling, large-scale processing, biometric data).  

---

#### **8. International Data Transfers**  
- Do not transfer data outside the EU unless:  
  - The destination has an “adequacy decision” from the EU Commission (e.g., Canada in limited cases),  
  - Contractual safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place.  

---

#### **9. Penalties for Non-Compliance**  
- Fines up to **€20 million** or **4% of annual global turnover**, whichever is higher. However, DPAs typically impose lower fines on SMEs if they show cooperation and mitigation efforts.  

---

#### **Steps to GDPR Compliance**  
1. **Audit Data Flows**: Map what data you collect, where it’s stored, and who handles it.  
2. **Update Privacy Policies**: Use plain language to explain data use.  
3. **Train Staff**: Ensure employees understand basic GDPR principles.  
4. **Prepare for Breaches**: Establish a response plan (e.g., IT protocols, contact with your DPA).  
5. **Review Contracts**: If using processors, ensure GDPR-compliant agreements are in place.

By adhering to these duties, SMEs can avoid costly fines while building trust with customers who value their privacy. If unsure, consult a legal expert to tailor compliance to your business needs.
