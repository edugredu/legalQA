The **European Union Toy Safety Directive (2009/48/EC)** imposes several key legal and regulatory obligations on businesses selling toys within the EU. Based on the summarized provisions provided, the requirements include:

---

### **1. Applicable Safety Standards (Chemical Requirements):**  
Businesses must ensure toys comply with the chemical safety limits specified in **Annex II (Appendix C)** of the Directive, particularly:  
- **Flame retardants (TCEP, TCPP, TDCP):**  
  - Maximum concentration limit of **5 mg/kg** for toys intended for children under 36 months or placed in the mouth.  
  - Effective from **Commission Directive 2014/79/EU** (applied by January 2016).  
- **Formamide:**  
  - **Emission limit of 20 μg/m³** (after 28 days of testing) for foam toys exceeding a **content cut-off of 200 mg/kg**.  
  - Added via **Commission Directive (EU) 2015/2115** (applied by May 2017).  
- **1,2-Benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one (Benzisothiazolinone):**  
  - Content limit of **5 mg/kg** in aqueous toy materials (e.g., slime), per testing methods in **EN 71-10:2005** and **EN 71-11:2005**.  
  - Added by **Commission Directive (EU) 2015/2116** (applied by May 2017).  

These rules cover toxic, carcinogenic, or environmentally hazardous substances in toys and apply specifically to products for children under 3 years or toys meant to be placed in the mouth.

### **2. Conformity Assessment Procedures:**  
While the summarized provisions do not detail broader conformity assessment processes, the Directive requires manufacturers to **test and document compliance** for chemical content and emissions. This involves:  
- Conducting tests in line with the **methods referenced in Appendix C** (e.g., EN 71 standards).  
- Maintaining technical documentation to demonstrate compliance with legal limits.  
- Applying a **CE marking** to confirm toys meet all applicable requirements, including these chemical restrictions.  

---

### **3. Labeling and CE Marking Obligations:**  
- The Directive mandates **clear labeling** of toys (e.g., age-range suitability, warnings) and affixing a **CE mark** before sale.  
- Although specific labeling rules are not detailed in the summarized amendments, the overall Directive requires warnings if a toy has risks (e.g., small parts for young children) and compliance with safety standards.  

---

### **4. Regulatory Enforcement and Deadlines:**  
- Member States were required to transpose the amendments to domestic law by the deadlines listed (e.g., May 2017 for formamide and benzisothiazolinone).  
- Manufacturers must ensure their products meet these limits from the “application dates” (e.g., December 2015 for 2014/79/EU, May 2017 for 2015 directives).  
- Authorities in Member States enforce compliance by checking adherence to these and other Directive requirements.  

---

### **5. Limitations of the Summarized Provisions:**  
The extracts provided focus **exclusively on chemical amendments** to the Toy Safety Directive and do not cover:  
- **Broader safety categories**: Physical/mechanical safety, flammability, electrical safety, or hygiene standards.  
- **Full conformity assessment details**: Such as involvement of notified bodies, required documentation, or recall obligations.  
- **Labeling specifics**: Including age-grading symbols or language requirements for EU countries.  

Businesses must refer to the **full 2009/48/EC Directive** (including EN 71 and EN 62115 standards) to ensure compliance with all safety categories, not just chemicals.  

---

### **Next Steps for Businesses:**  
1. **Test toys** for restricted chemical substances using accredited laboratories.  
2. **Update technical documentation** and ensure alignment with the latest Annex II amendments.  
3. **Revise labeling and CE marking practices** by the deadlines specified for each amendment.  
4. **Monitor ongoing updates** to the Directive, particularly regarding chemical limits (e.g., BPA, phthalates not mentioned here).  

Failure to comply may result in products being withdrawn from the EU market or legal penalties under Member State laws. If EU legislation changes, businesses should track these shifts through the European Commission’s official publications.
