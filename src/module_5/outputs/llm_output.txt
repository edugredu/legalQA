The legal provisions you’ve provided do **not directly address the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** or its requirements for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These documents relate to topics such as the electronic publication of official journals, professional qualifications, safety standards for equipment, and digital libraries, but none cover data protection obligations for SMEs under GDPR. 

However, based on general knowledge of GDPR (which applies to all businesses, including SMEs, processing personal data of EU residents), here is a summary of essential legal duties and compliance measures that SMEs must follow as **data controllers or processors**:

### **Key GDPR Duties for SMEs**
1. **Lawful Processing**  
   - SMEs must process personal data only if they have a valid legal basis (e.g., consent, contract, legal obligation, or legitimate interest).  
   - They must clearly inform individuals about the purpose of data collection and how their data will be used.

2. **Transparency and Privacy Notices**  
   - Provide simple, clear information to individuals about:  
     - What data is collected,  
     - Why it’s collected,  
     - Who it’s shared with,  
     - How long it’s stored,  
     - Their rights (e.g., to access, correct, or delete their data).

3. **Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation**  
   - Collect only the data strictly necessary for the stated purpose.  
   - Do not use data for unrelated purposes without additional consent.

4. **Data Security**  
   - Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect data from breaches, loss, or unauthorized access (e.g., encryption, access controls, staff training).

5. **Data Subject Rights**  
   - Allow individuals to exercise their rights, such as:  
     - Accessing their data,  
     - Correcting inaccuracies,  
     - Requesting deletion (right to be forgotten),  
     - Objecting to processing, and  
     - Obtaining data in a portable format.

6. **Breach Notification**  
   - Report data breaches to the relevant **Data Protection Authority (DPA)** within 72 hours of becoming aware of them.  
   - Notify affected individuals if the breach poses a high risk to their rights and freedoms.

7. **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**  
   - SMEs **must appoint a DPO** only if their core activities involve large-scale processing of sensitive data (e.g., health, race) or monitoring individuals systematically.  
   - If not required, they still need to ensure compliance through internal measures.

8. **Record-Keeping and Documentation**  
   - Maintain records of processing activities, especially if they process large volumes of data or sensitive information.  
   - Document data processing agreements with third-party processors.

### **Compliance Measures for SMEs**
- **Conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** for high-risk processing (e.g., using new technologies or processing large datasets).  
- **Perform regular audits** to ensure compliance with GDPR principles.  
- **Train employees** on data protection practices.  
- **Ensure third-party compliance** by using contracts that bind processors to GDPR standards.

### **Limitations of the Provided Laws**
The summarized laws above do not address GDPR or data protection obligations. They pertain to unrelated areas (e.g., certification processes, professional qualifications, safety standards). For specific GDPR guidance, SMEs should refer to the **GDPR text itself** (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) or national data protection laws (e.g., the UK’s DPA 2018, Germany’s BDSG). 

### **Next Steps for SMEs**
If your business processes EU residents’ data, you should:  
- Assess your data processing activities.  
- Update privacy policies and procedures.  
- Consult a legal expert to tailor compliance to your operations.  
- Report breaches promptly and handle data subject requests efficiently.  

Failure to comply with GDPR can result in **fines up to 4% of global revenue or €20 million**, depending on the violation. For detailed advice, refer to official resources like the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) or your national DPA.
