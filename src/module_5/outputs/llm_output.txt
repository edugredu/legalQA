**Answer to the User's GDPR Compliance Question for SMEs**  

The laws provided in your question (e.g., Regulation 32019R0980 on prospectuses, 32019R1122 on emissions trading systems, etc.) **do not address GDPR requirements**. They focus on financial market disclosures, climate change regulations, aviation safety, and other technical areas. Since GDPR is not among them, the following **general GDPR obligations applicable to SMEs** are based on standard GDPR text and principles, not the summarized laws supplied:

### **Key GDPR Legal Duties and Compliance Measures for SMEs**  

1. **Lawful Basis for Data Processing**  
   SMEs must have a **valid reason** to collect or use personal data (e.g., consent, contractual necessity, legal obligation, legitimate interest). For example:  
   - If using customer data to send marketing emails, you must obtain consent or rely on legitimate interest (with a balancing test).  
   - If processing employee data, legal compliance (e.g., payroll taxes) may be the lawful basis.  

2. **Transparency and Notice Requirements**  
   SMEs must provide individuals with **clear, concise information** about how their data is used, including:  
   - The purpose of processing (e.g., order fulfillment, newsletter subscription).  
   - How long data will be retained.  
   - Whether data will be shared with third parties or transferred internationally.  
   **Example**: A website must display a privacy notice (or link to one) at the point of data collection.  

3. **Data Subject Rights**  
   SMEs must enable individuals to exercise their rights, such as:  
   - **Access**: Respond to requests for copies of their data.  
   - **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate personal information.  
   - **Erasure (“Right to be Forgotten”)**: Delete data when it’s no longer needed or if they object to its use.  
   - **Data Portability**: Provide data in a machine-readable format upon request.  
   SMEs should have processes to **timely respond** to such requests (usually within 30–90 days).  

4. **Data Security**  
   Even small businesses must implement appropriate **technical and organizational safeguards** to protect data from unauthorized access, loss, or breach. Examples:  
   - Encrypting sensitive data.  
   - Using secure servers and passwords.  
   - Training employees on data protection.  

5. **Breach Notification**  
   If a data breach occurs (e.g., unauthorized exposure of customer email addresses), SMEs must:  
   - Notify the relevant **Data Protection Authority (DPA)** within 72 hours (if the breach poses a risk to individuals).  
   - Inform affected individuals directly **if the breach is high-risk** (e.g., theft of financial data).  

6. **Record-Keeping (When Required)**  
   SMEs **with fewer than 250 employees** generally don’t need to maintain documents of processing activities unless:  
   - Their processing impacts individuals’ rights (e.g., health data).  
   - They engage in regular monitoring of individuals (e.g., employee surveillance).  
   **If applicable**, records should detail data categories, recipients, and retention periods.  

7. **International Transfers (if applicable)**  
   SMEs transferring personal data outside the EU must ensure adequate protections (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses or transfers to countries with EU-recognized adequacy decisions).  

8. **Special Categories of Data**  
   If SMEs process sensitive data (e.g., health information, political opinions), they must meet stricter conditions, such as explicit consent or legal necessity.

### **Obligations Specific to SMEs**  

- **Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: SMEs are **exempt** unless their core activities involve large-scale processing of sensitive data or systematic monitoring.  
- **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)**: Required only if processing poses a high risk (e.g., facial recognition, automated decision-making).  
- **Fines and Penalties**: SMEs face GDPR fines (up to €10 million/2% of global turnover for lesser violations), but penalties may be **scaled based on size and context** compared to large corporations.

### **Next Steps for GDPR Compliance**  

To comply with GDPR, SMEs should:  
- **Audit Data Practices**: Identify what data they collect, how it’s stored, and who has access.  
- **Create Privacy Policies**: Update website privacy notices and internal data protocols.  
- **Train Employees**: Ensure staff understand data handling rules and breach response.  
- **Pseudonymize Data**: Where possible, reduce risks by not storing identifiable details unnecessarily.  
- **Document Breach Procedures**: Establish a plan to report breaches to DPAs and affected individuals.

### **Limitations of This Response**  
The **summarized laws provided** do not reference GDPR or data protection obligations. If your SME operates in sectors covered by the listed laws (e.g., energy emissions trading under 32019R1122), these regulations may impose **sector-specific data rules** (e.g., logging allowance transfers). However, for GDPR-specific guidance, refer to the full text of **Regulation (EU) 2016/679** or the [European Data Protection Board’s SME resources](https://edpb.eu).  

**Recommendation**: Consult an expert for tailored advice, especially if you process sensitive data, operate internationally, or engage in complex data activities.
