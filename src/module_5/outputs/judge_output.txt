  "explanation": "The final answer addresses the user's question about returning a defective product by citing relevant statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and warranty rules, making it highly relevant. It includes key remedies like rejection, refund, repair, and replacement, but lacks explicit details on proof of purchase or partial refunds in certain scenarios. The language is simple, clear, and well-structured for non-experts. Accuracy is excellent, as the provisions align with the summarized laws. While some legal justification is provided (e.g., timeliness affecting remedies), a deeper explanation of why warranties coexist with statutory rights could strengthen the response."
