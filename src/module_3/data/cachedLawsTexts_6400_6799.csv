","COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2093/93 of 28 July 1993 fixing the buying-in prices, aids and certain other amounts applicable for the 1993/94 wine year to intervention measures in the wine sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 257 (1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1566/93 (2), and in particular Articles 35 (8), 36 (6), 38 (5), 41 (10), 44, 45 (9) and 46  (5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 provides for a reduction in prices fixed in ecus at the commencement of the marketing year following a monetary realignment; whereas, in order to apply that reduction, which is equal to 25 % of the  percentage change in the correcting factor referred to in Article 1 (c) of that Regulation, the reducing coefficient provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 537/93 (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1331/93 (5), should be applied;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1569/93 (6) fixes the guide prices for wine for the 1993/94, wine year; whereas the prices, aids and other amounts for the various intervention measures to be adopted for that wine year should accordingly be fixed on  that basis;
Whereas this Regulation applies to Portugal; whereas, however, since wine-growing zones have not been delimited in that country, the oenological practices authorized in accordance with the rules laid down under Title II of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87  should be defined;
Whereas, since enrichment is an exceptional practice, the same reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and laid down in Annex VIII should be applied as in wine-growing zone C; whereas, in  accordance with Article 341 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal the derogations in force for 'vinho verde' should be extended;
Whereas the aid for the use in wine-making of concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must as provided for in Article 45 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 must be fixed taking into account the difference between the cost of enrichment  achieved using concentrated grape must and using sucrose; whereas, in the light of the data available to the Commission, the amount of the aid should be varied with the product used for enrichment;
Whereas distillers may, in accordance with Articles 35 (6) and 36 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, either receive aid for the product to be distilled or deliver the product obtained from distillation to the intervention agency; whereas the amount of  the aid must be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89 (7), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1567/93 (8);
Whereas the price of wine to be distilled under Articles 38 and 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 does not normally allow the marketing at market prices of products obtained from distillation; whereas provision must thereofre be made for aid, the amount  of which is to be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89, account also being taken of the present uncertainty of prices on the market for distillation products;
Whereas some wine delivered for one of the distillation operations may be processed into wine fortified of distillation; whereas the amounts applicable to distillation in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89  should be adjusted accordingly;
Whereas experience gained in sales by invitation to tender of alcohol held by intervention agencies shows that the difference between prices which may be obtained for neutral spirits and raw alcohol does not justify the takeover of the former; whereas,  moreover, quantities of neutral spirits currently available are sufficient to satisfy, at least for one wine year, any demand for that product; whereas under these circumstances the possibility provided for in Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Regulation (EEC)  No 822/87 should be used by producing for the buying-in of all alcohol at the price for raw alcohol;
Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88 (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3186/92 (10), laying down detailed rules for the application of cumpulsory distillation as provided for in Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EEC) No  822/87 sets a standard natural alcohol strength by volume to be applied in the various wine-growing zones for the purpose of determining the volume of alcohol to be delivered for distillation under Article 35 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87; whereas it  has not been possible to fix this standard natural alcoholic strength in Portugual because the wine-growing zones in that country have not yet been delimited; whereas, therefore, a provisional standard natural alcohol strength should be fixed;
Whereas Article 46 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 lays down criteria for fixing the aid provided for in that Article; whereas, as regards the aid for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must for the manufacture of grape juice,  paragraph 4 of that Article stipulates that a part of the aid should be set aside for the organization of campaigns to promote the consumption of grape juice and whereas the aid may be increased to that end; whereas, having regard to the criteria laid  down and ot the need to finance those campaigns, the aid shoud be fixed at a level permitting sufficient quantities to be obtained for the effective promotion of the product;
Whereas the reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 depends on the average increase in the natural alcoholic strength in each wine-growing zone; whereas experience shows that that increase  corresponds on average to half the maximum increase authorized; whereas the reduction in the buying-in price must accordingly correspond to the added alcoholic strength as a percentage of the alcoholic strength of wine delivered for distillation;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3800/81 of 16 December 1981 determing the classification of vine varieties (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3369/91 (12), establishes the list of vine varieties recommended and authorized in Portugal;  whereas, in assessing the production of wine in Portugal, reference should be made to those vine varieties;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 (2) lays down the application rules of Regulation (CEE) No 3730/87 for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community by charitable organisations designated by the Member States.
(2) In order to ensure more standardised implementation in the Member States participating in this scheme, the concepts of ‘beneficiaries’ and ‘final recipients’ of the measure need to be clarified. In order to facilitate the management and control of the implementation of the annual plan as laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 3149/92, the charitable organisations designated by the competent national authorities can be deemed final recipients if they are actually engaged in the local distribution of the foodstuffs (in various forms) where the most deprived persons live.
(3) Implementation of the plan in each participating Member State must be programmed, phased and regular both as regards withdrawals of the products from intervention stocks and the performance of the later phases until distribution to the beneficiaries or final recipients, in order to satisfy both the aim of the Community measure and the requirement to manage intervention stocks well. To this end, most withdrawals from intervention stocks should occur before 1 July of the year in which the plan is implemented. In the case of milk products, the characteristics of this sensitive market and in particular the impact of re-introducing products onto the market require provision to be made for limiting withdrawals of these products from public storage as part of the measure concerned, during periods when buying-in by intervention agencies is possible and, with effect from the implementation of the 2006 plan, even during the weeks preceding these buying-in periods. Appropriate measures must be implemented by the Member States, to include sanctions in line with the length of the delay in taking over the products.
(4) The most appropriate types of check of the implementation of the annual plan should be specified and in particular the rate of checks to be made by the competent authorities. The annual reports of plan implementation should include information allowing both the outcome of the checks and the plan’s implementation to be assessed. The checks must be carried out with due regard to the application of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (3).
(5) Regulation (EEC) No 3149/1992 should be amended accordingly. These amendments should apply from the start of the 2005 annual plan period.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Whereas the present situation and expected development of transport in the Community makes it necessary to manage the Community's transport resources to optimum effect in accordance with environmental protection requirements; whereas this means  encouraging the use of combined transport, as stated by the Council in its resolution of 30 October 1990 on setting up a European combined transport network (1);
Whereas the establishment of a combined transport network should be supplemented by measures concerning the organization of intermodal transport chains;
Whereas, since such measures constitute a new field, it is necessary to acquire the essential know-how in order to be able to explore the usefulness of a common policy in this sphere; whereas, therefore, pilot projects should be launched with the aim of  gathering information on the feasibility of measures to organize intermodal transport chains;
Whereas, in accordance with the principle of the free choice of transport mode, these pilot projects must include financial support measures which will help develop good quality services through effective cooperation which observes the rules of  competition between operators;
Whereas this financial support, which is intended to promote measures to organize the chain of the relevant modes of transport, must focus on a wide range of qualitative measures, excluding the financing of physical infrastructure or technological  research projects, either in the form of studies, in particular feasibility studies, or of a financial contribution to innovative schemes aimed at improving the quality of the service;
Whereas the financial support must be provided for a limited period and act as a special incentive to encourage operators to develop services of this kind,","{'title': '93/45/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 December 1992 concerning the granting of financial support for pilot schemes to promote combined transport', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 7 December 2009
authorising the Republic of Latvia to extend the application of a measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax
(2009/1008/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 3 March 2009, the Republic of Latvia (hereinafter Latvia) requested an authorisation to continue to apply a measure derogating from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC governing the person liable for the payment of the VAT to the tax authorities.
(2) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Latvia in a letter dated 22 September 2009. By a letter dated 24 September 2009, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the information that it deemed necessary to consider the request.
(3) The timber market in Latvia is dominated by small local companies and individual suppliers. The nature of the market and the businesses involved have generated tax fraud which the tax authorities have found difficult to control. Therefore, a special provision was included in Latvia’s law on VAT, laying down that, as regards timber transactions, the person liable to pay tax is the taxable person for whom the taxable supply of goods or services is carried out.
(4) The measure derogates from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, stipulating that, under the internal system, the taxable person supplying goods or service is normally liable for the payment of the tax.
(5) The measure has previously been authorised in the 2003 Act of Accession (2), in particular in Chapter 7, point 1(b) of Annex VIII thereto, and by Decision 2006/42/EC of 24 January 2006 (3) under the then applicable Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (4).
(6) The Commission understands that the legal and factual situation which justified the current application of the derogating measure in question has not changed and continues to exist. Latvia should therefore be authorised to apply the measure during a further limited period.
(7) The derogation will not adversely affect the Union’s own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '24.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 347/30', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 7 December 2009\nauthorising the Republic of Latvia to extend the application of a measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2009/1008/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 3 March 2009, the Republic of Latvia (hereinafter Latvia) requested an authorisation to continue to apply a measure derogating from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC governing the person liable for the payment of the VAT to the tax authorities.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Latvia in a letter dated 22 September 2009.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Article 66 thereof,
Having regard to Decision No 24/54 of 6 May 1954 laying down in implementation of Article 66 (1) of the Treaty a Regulation on what constitutes control of an undertaking (1),
Having regard to the application made on 4 February 1981 by Petrofina SA, Brussels, and Krupp Handel GmbH, Düsseldorf, for authorization of the joint formation of Eurocoal SA, Brussels, by Etmofina SA, Brussels, and Krupp Handel GmbH, Düsseldorf,
Having obtained the comments of the Governments of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany,
Whereas:
I  1. Eurocoal is intended to handle in combination the coal trade interests of Krupp Handel and Etmofina in the common market, with the exception of the Federal Republic of Germany, and in a number of non-member countries.
It is further intended that Eurocoal will commence operations in the Federal Republic of Germany at an opportune moment.
The joint subsidiary is to trade in solid fuels, no express distinction having been made between supplies obtained from the Community and those obtained from non-member countries. It is estimated that its turnover will reach between one and two million tonnes after five years.
The founder undertakings will each have a 50 % stake in Eurocoal.
2. Etmofina is a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrofina and is combined with it. Petrofina is a multinational group engaged mainly in all spheres of the oil industry (discovery, extraction, transportation and refining of crude oil petrochemicals and the marketing of finished products). In 1979, the group achieved a turnover of some Bfrs 273 000 million (about 6 800 million ECU). Taking these circumstances into account, Etmofina is not an undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty.
3. Krupp Handel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fried. Krupp GmbH (Krupp Group). The Krupp Group, with which Krupp Handel is combined, is engaged in steel production, shipbuilding, industrial plant production, mechanical engineering, distribution and services (involving, amongst other things, coal). In 1979, the group's turnover amounted to some DM 13 000 million (about 5 150 million ECU). Krupp Handel is an undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty.
4. Both groups are convinced that the changes which have occurred on the world energy market since 1973, together with the ever-decreasing capacity of hydrocarbons to meet energy requirements, will lead to a continuing increase in solid fuel consumption.
In their view, this will involve not only the emergence of new requirements, but also requirements stemming from the changeover from fuel oil to solid fuel consumption.
II
The two groups' trade in solid fuels in the territory covered by the agreement will in future be carried out by the joint subsidiary alone. While Krupp Handel will withdraw from such activity, Petrofina will refrain from becoming active in this market. For the purposes of their joint activity in the field of solid fuels distribution, both groups possess tangible and intangible  (1) Official Journal of the ECSC, 11.5.1954, p. 345.  resources which are mutually complementary. These resources include the two parent companies' existing marketing networks and also their existing and potential customers and supply contracts. While Krupp Handel's customers are in some cases consumers of solid fuels and in others of mineral oil products, Petrofina, which trades in mineral oil products has customers who are potential converts from mineral oil products to coal or already use coal to cover part of their energy needs and who thus represent an ideal element of goodwill for Eurocoal as regards trade in coal. Wherever they can be of use, these resources will be transferred or made available to the joint subsidiary.
Under these conditions, the formation of Eurocoal does not constitute an agreement between the parent companies on the coordination of their market operations, but the creation of an autonomous business entity. The proposed transaction will therefore lead to a concentration within the meaning of Article 66 (1) of the Treaty in the form of group control. The agreements on the equal participation in Eurocoal and on its management will prevent either parent company from exercising individual control over the company. It will be controlled jointly by the parent companies, the latter acting as a group in the pursuit of their common business interests. The joint undertaking will therefore be merged with Petrofina and Fried. Krupp GmbH and with the undertakings controlled by them, without the two groups being merged with each other.
Such concentrations may be approved if it can be shown that certain restraints of competition are not involved. This condition is met for the following reasons:
The proposed transaction is of only limited significance in the territory of the common market. In 1980, consumption of solid fuels - excluding supplies to State railways and the steel industry, which are generally reserved for mining undertakings - amounted to some 225 million tonnes.
This amount is distributed partly by the producers, which in some cases fulfil a distributive function, and partly by a large number of wholesale coal distributors. The latter include several which each year sell more than two million tonnes of solid fuels.
Under the given circumstances, Eurocoal's planned turnover, even when increased to include Krupp Handel's supplies in the Federal Republic of Germany, is not likely to achieve a market share of more than some 2 % in solid fuels within the common market. Even in the future, there will thus be sufficient competition on this market. Even though it must be remembered that, through its stake in Eurocoal, Petrofina will cease to be a potential competitor in the marketing of solid fuels, it is clear that the parent companies will not be able, through Eurocoal, to determine prices, to control or restrict production or distribution or to hinder effective competition in a substantial part of the market in solid fuels. Nor will the proposed transaction enable them to evade the rules of competition, in particular by establishing an artificially privileged position involving a substantial advantage in access to supplies or markets.
A group effect between Fried. Krupp GmbH and Petrofina will not be created, since the latter has hitherto not been involved in the production or distribution of solid fuels.
Accordingly, the proposed transaction satisfies the conditions for authorization set out in Article 66 and may therefore be authorized,","{'title': '81/789/ECSC: Commission Decision of 14 September 1981 on the joint formation of Eurocoal Sa, Brussels, by Etmofina SA, Brussels, and Krupp Handel GmbH, Düsseldorf (Only the Dutch text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe joint formation of the firm Eurocoal, Brussels, by Etmofina SA, Brussels, and Krupp Handel GmbH, Düsseldorf, is hereby authorized.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to Petrofina SA, Brussels, and Krupp Handel GmbH, Düsseldorf.\n\nDone at Brussels, 14 September 1981.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 on information on the payer accompanying transfers of funds (1), and in particular Article 17 thereof,
Having regard to the application from the United Kingdom,
Whereas:
(1) On 15 December 2006, the United Kingdom requested a derogation under Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 for the transfers of funds between the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom.
(2) In accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006, transfers of funds between the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, the Isle of Man respectively and the United Kingdom have been provisionally treated as transfers of funds within the United Kingdom from 1 January 2007.
(3) Member States were informed at the meeting of the Committee for the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing of 18 April 2008 that the Commission considered that it had received the information necessary for appraising the request made by the United Kingdom.
(4) The Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey, and the Isle of Man do not form part of the territory of the Community as determined in accordance with Article 299 of the EC Treaty but form part of the currency area of the United Kingdom and therefore comply with the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006.
(5) Payment services providers in the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man participate directly in payment and settlement systems in the United Kingdom, and will participate in the future ‘faster payments’ system. They therefore comply with the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006.
(6) The Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man respectively have incorporated into their legal orders provisions corresponding to those of Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 in particular through the ‘Community provisions (wire transfers) (Jersey) Regulations 2007’, the ‘Transfers of funds ordinances for Guernsey, Sark and Alderney (Bailiwick of Guernsey)’, the ‘Isle of Man’s European Communities (Wire Transfers Regulation) (application) Order 2007’ and the ‘Isle of Man’s EC Wire Transfer Regulations 2007’.
(7) The Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008 supplemented by the Handbook for the prevention and detection of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, the Bailiwick of Guernsey’s Criminal Justice (Proceeds of Crime) Regulations 2007 supplemented by the Handbook for financial services businesses on countering financial crime and terrorist financing, and the Isle of Man’s Criminal Justice (Money Laundering) Code 2007 supplemented by the Anti-money laundering guidance notes handbook, respectively contribute to the building of a sound anti-money laundering regime in these three jurisdictions.
(8) The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Channel Islands) Order 2001 (SI 2001 No 3363) and The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) (Isle of Man) Order 2001 (SI 2001 No 3364) as well as the Al-Qa’ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) (Channel Islands) Order 2002 (SI 2002 No 258) and Al-Qa’ida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) (Isle of Man) Order 2002 (SI 2002 No 259), in combination with the use of a consolidated list of asset freeze targets issued by the United Kingdom which covers the financial sanctions targets listed by the United Nations, the European Union and the United Kingdom, ensure that appropriate measures are in place in the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man to impose financial penalties vis-à-vis entities or persons listed by the United Nations or the European Union.
(9) Therefore, the Bailiwick of Jersey, the Bailiwick of Guernsey and the Isle of Man have adopted the same rules as those established under Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006 and require their respective payment services providers to apply them, thus fulfilling the criterion set out in Article 17(1)(c) of that Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) (1), and in particular Article 14(2) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the committee established pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 2010/13/EU,
Whereas:
(1) By letter of 19 August 2014, Poland notified to the Commission certain measures to be taken, pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU.
(2) The Commission verified, within a period of 3 months from this notification, the compatibility of those measures with Union law, in particular with regard to the proportionality of the measures and the transparency of the national consultation procedure.
(3) In examining the measures, the Commission took into consideration the available data on the Polish audiovisual market, in particular as regards the impact on the television market.
(4) The list of events of major importance for society was drawn up by Poland in a clear and transparent manner, following a wide consultation.
(5) On the basis of detailed evidence and viewing figures provided by the Polish authorities, the Commission services verified that the list of designated events drawn up in accordance with Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU met at least two of the following criteria considered to be reliable indicators of the importance of events for society: (i) a special general resonance within the Member State, and not simply a significance to those who ordinarily follow the sport or activity concerned; (ii) a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the population in the Member State, in particular as a catalyst of cultural identity; (iii) involvement of the national team in the event concerned in the context of a competition or tournament of international importance; and (iv) the fact that the event has traditionally been broadcast on free television and has commanded large television audiences.
(6) The notified list of events of major importance for society contains both the events which are already on the statutory list foreseen by Article 20b of the Broadcasting Act of 29 December 1992, as modified by Act of 31 March 2000, and other events which are part of the draft regulation of the Broadcasting Council of the list of major events. A number of the designated events are generally considered as events of major importance for society such as the summer and winter Olympic Games, the final and semi-finals of the Football World Cup and the European Football Championship. The list also includes other football matches within those events involving the Polish national team, including qualifying games. As demonstrated by the Polish authorities, these events commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. In addition they have a special general resonance in Poland, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events. Moreover, some matches within the Football World Cup and the European Football Championship including qualifying games, involve the Polish national team.
(7) These other football matches in official tournaments and the Champions League and UEFA Cup where the Polish national team or Polish club participate, command large television audiences and traditionally have been broadcast on free-to-air television and have special general resonance in Poland.
(8) The matches of world and European men's and women's volleyball championships where the Polish national team participates, including the qualifying tournaments and the men's volleyball World League, commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. Additionally, they generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve a national team in an international tournament of major importance. This interest is reinforced by the fact that Polish participants have earned significant achievements in these tournaments.
(9) The semi-finals and finals of world and European men's handball championships, apart from commanding large television audiences and being traditionally broadcast on free-to air television, generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. Other competitions during semi-finals and finals of world and European men's handball championships where the Polish national team was involved also commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to air television. In addition, they generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve a national team in an international tournament of major importance where Polish participants have earned significant achievements.
(10) The Nordic Ski World Championships, Ski Jumping World Cup events and women's Cross-Country Ski World Cup events, apart from commanding large television audiences and being traditionally broadcast on free-to-air television, generate a particular and widespread interest in Poland even for audiences that do not usually follow this discipline. They also involve the Polish national team in an international tournament of major importance where the Polish participants have earned significant achievements.
(11) The World Championship in Athletics commanded large television audiences and have traditionally been broadcast on free-to-air television. Moreover, they have special and wide-spread resonance in Poland, even for audiences that do not usually follow the disciplines represented at this event. Polish competitors have earned significant achievements in pole vault, shot-put and discus throw.
(12) Taking into account the modalities according to which those events of major importance for society will be broadcast, the definition of a ‘qualifying broadcaster’, the role of the Broadcasting Council in the resolution of disputes mechanism in case of disputes in the course of the implementation of the measures, and the date foreseen for the entry into force of the final Polish measures (12 months after the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union), the designated measures do not go beyond what is necessary for the achievement of the aim pursued, namely the protection of the right to information and the wide access of the public to television coverage of national or non-national events of major importance for society. Therefore, it may be concluded that the effects on the right of property, as provided for in Article 17 of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, do not go beyond those which are intrinsically linked to the inclusion of the events in the list provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU.
(13) For the same reasons, the Polish measures appear to be proportionate to justify, by the overriding reason of public interest in ensuring wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society, the derogation from the fundamental freedom to provide services laid down in Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In addition, the Polish measures do not constitute any discrimination or market foreclosure against other Member States' broadcasters, right holders or other economic operators.
(14) The designated measures are also compatible with Union competition rules in so far as the definition of the qualifying broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria, which allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of designated events is not disproportionate to an extent that would distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets. Therefore, it may be considered that the effects on the freedom of competition do not go beyond those which are intrinsically linked to the inclusion of the events in the list provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU.
(15) The Commission communicated the measures to be taken by Poland to the other Member States and presented the results of its verification to the committee established pursuant to Article 29 of Directive 2010/13/EU.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1728/74 (2) of 27 June 1974 on the coordination of agricultural research provides for the coordination at Community level of national agricultural research activities in order to further the attainment of the aims of the common agricultural policy;
Whereas Article 5 of the above Regulation provides that the Council shall decide on specific measures for the coordination of research activities designed to allow rational organization of means employed, efficient use of results and the orientation of such work towards the aims of the common agricultural policy and shall also decide on the implementation of joint projects designed to second or supplement work undertaken in the Member States in fields which are of particular importance to the Community;
Whereas progress in research on epizootics makes a direct contribution to the improvement of farm productivity and eliminates major obstacles to the harmonization of legislation and to trade in animals and animal products both inside the Community and with non-member countries ; whereas the lack of a differential diagnosis and of knowledge regarding the resistance process in the case of avian leucosis and Marek's disease represents a serious danger for poultry farms ; whereas the lack of a reliable method of diagnosis for bovine leucosis constitutes an impediment to the free movement of live cattle;
Whereas the trend towards the specialization and intensification of animal production has given rise to large and intensive livestock units very often without pasturage ; whereas the dumping of waste from these units presents serious problems as regards the pollution of the environment, particularly when, as frequently happens, these enterprises are near centres of population ; whereas, moreover, these livestock effluents can be very valuable manure ; whereas for this purpose farmers generally use mineral fertilizers which are expensive and the long-term availability of which is not guaranteed ; whereas the intensive usage of mineral fertilizers also presents a pollution risk;
Whereas the income for a large proportion of farms in the Community depends on the results of beef production ; whereas, independently of structural problems, the profitability of intensive beef production is inadequate ; whereas the necessary increase in productivity cannot be obtained by increasing prices ; whereas progress as regards breeding methods, meat quality and meat yield per animal are therefore necessary ; whereas progress in research is usually slower and harder to apply directly in the field of beef production;
Whereas the Community is confronted by a serious deficit in the supply of protein for animal feed ; whereas, at the same time, the cost of protein products is of increasing importance in the cost price of animal products ; whereas, it consequently appears essential to increase protein production in the Community ; whereas an important contribution can be made by improving the protein yield per unit of crops already grown in the Community ; whereas, at the same time the introduction of new species and varieties rich in protein should be studied ; whereas, at the same time, research is necessary on the use of proteins in animal feed;

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 (2), sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs.
(2) According to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001, the Commission shall review the provisions as regards ochratoxin A (OTA) in dried vine fruit and with a view to including a maximum level for OTA in green and roasted coffee and coffee products, wine, beer, grape juice, cocoa and cocoa products and spices taking into account the investigations undertaken and the prevention measures applied to reduce the presence of OTA in these products.
(3) The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) concluded in its opinion on OTA, expressed on 17 September 1998, that OTA is a mycotoxin which possesses carcinogenic, nephrotoxic, teratogenic, immunotoxic and possibly neurotoxic properties. The Committee mentioned also that further studies are ongoing to elucidate the mechanisms involved in OTA carcinogenicity. It is anticipated that the European research project on the mechanisms of OTA induced carcinogenicity will be finished by the end of 2004. Once the comprehensive research results are available, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) will be requested by the Commission to update the scientific opinion from SCF in the light of these new research results.
(4) An assessment of the dietary intake of OTA by the population of the Community has been performed in the framework of Council Directive 1993/5/EEC of 25 February 1993 on assistance to the Commission and cooperation by the Member States in the scientific examination of questions relating to food (3) (SCOOP). The main contributor to the OTA exposure is cereal and cereal products. Wine, coffee and beer were identified as significant contributors to the human OTA exposure. Dried vine fruit and grape juice contributed to a significant extent to the OTA-exposure for specific groups of vulnerable groups of consumers such as children.
(5) A maximum level for OTA has been established for cereal and cereal products and dried vine fruit by Regulation (EC) 466/2001. The level of OTA in beer is indirectly controlled as the OTA in beer originates from the presence of OTA in malt, for which a maximum level has been established. The setting of a maximum level for OTA in beer is therefore not immediately necessary to protect public health, but should be considered in the frame of the foreseen review.
(6) Given the significant contribution of wine and roasted coffee together with soluble coffee to the OTA human exposure and the significant contribution of grape juice to the OTA exposure of children, it is appropriate to set already at this stage for these foodstuffs maximum levels to protect public health by preventing the distribution of unacceptably highly contaminated foodstuffs.
(7) OTA has also been observed in dried fruit other than dried vine fruit, cocoa and cocoa products, spices and liquorice. The appropriateness of setting a maximum level for OTA in these foodstuffs, including green coffee, as well a review of the existing maximum levels will be considered after the availability of the EFSA assessment of the research results on OTA toxicology.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

","COUNCIL  DECISION

authorizing extension or tacit renewal of certain trade agreements concluded between the Member States and third countries
(86/18/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 69/494/EEC of 16 December 1969 on the progressive standardization of agreements concerning commercial relations between Member States and third countries and on the negotiation of Community agreements (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas extension or tacit renewal beyond the end of the transitional period was last authorized in the case of the Agreements and Protocols listed in the Annex by Council Decision 84/558/EEC (2);
Whereas the Member States concerned have, with a view to avoiding disruption of their commercial relations with the third countries concerned based on agreement, requested authorization to extend or renew the abovementioned Agreements;
Whereas, however, most of the areas covered by these national agreements are henceforth the subject of Community agreements; whereas in this situation there should be authorization for the maintenance of national agreements only for those areas not covered by Community agreements; whereas, in addition, such authorization should not therefore adversely affect the obligation incumbent upon the Member States to avoid and, where appropriate, to eliminate any incompatibility between such agreements and the provisions of Community law;
Whereas the provisions of the instruments to be either extended or tacitly renewed should not, furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas the Member States concerned have declared that the extension or tacit renewal of these agreements would neither constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community negotiations with the third countries concerned and the transfer of the commercial substance thereof to Community agreements nor, during the period under consideration, hinder the adoption of the measures necessary to complete the standardization of the import arrangements applied by the Member States;
Whereas at the conclusion of the consultations provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC it was established, as the aforesaid declarations by the Member States concerned confirm, that the provisions of the agreements to be extended or tacitly renewed would not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas, in these circumstances, the agreements concerned may be either extended or tacitly renewed for a limited period,","{'title': '86/18/EEC: Council Decision of 27 January 1986 authorizing

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

(2) This import quota relates to a maximum annual quantity of 2981600 tonnes, including 572000 tonnes for imports originating in the United States and 38000 tonnes for imports originating in Canada.
(3) The opening of this quota means that Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 has to be adapted. In order to enable the quota to be opened on 1 January 2003, provision should be made to derogate from Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 during a transitional period expiring on the date of entry into force of the amendment to that Regulation, but until 30 June 2003 at the latest.
(4) To ensure that imports of the common wheat covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences are to be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject where appropriate to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.
(5) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in applications and licences should be specified.
(6) To take account of supply conditions, a derogation should be made concerning the period of validity of the licences.
(7) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(8), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.
(8) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(10).
(9) Rapid two-way communication should be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(1), as last amended by Council Decision 2001/572/EC of 23 July 2001(2) and, in particular, Article 19 and Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The protection of human health against diseases and infections directly or indirectly transmissible from animals to man (zoonoses) is of paramount importance.
(2) The Community is currently in the process of reviewing its policy on the control and prevention of zoonoses.
(3) In this framework, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health was requested to express an opinion on the basis of zoonoses control policies, where special attention should be paid to the assessment of risks related to zoonotic diseases causing major concern to public health.
(4) In its conclusions of the opinion of 12 April 2000, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health identified campylobacter as one of the most important food-borne zoonoses currently, if referring to the number of reported human cases. It recognised that a number of gaps exist in the knowledge of the epidemiology of campylobacter as a food-borne zoonosis. It indicated in particular that the efficiency of establishing strict hygiene barriers at poultry farm level should be documented, and that the efficiency of procedures to lower the prevalence of Campylobacter at farm level needs further scrutiny.
(5) The Swedish authorities presented on 31 May 2000, with a view to obtain financial support from the Community, a multi-annual national surveillance programme of campylobacter in broilers, and a revised programme on 13 October 2000, to estimate the baseline prevalence both in primary production and in the food chain, and to progressively reinforce implementation of hygienic measures in farms with a view to lower the prevalence at farm level and subsequently along the food chain. The programme started from 1 July 2001.
(6) In the light of the importance of campylobacter as a zoonosis, it is useful to provide financial assistance for an appropriate period of time within a maximum of four years, to cover certain costs incurred by Sweden and to collect valuable technical and scientific information. For budgetary reasons, Community assistance is decided each year. By Commission Decisions 2001/29/EC(3) of 27 December 2000 and 2001/866/EC(4) of 3 December 2001, the Community provided financial assistance respectively for the second semester of the year 2001 and for the year 2002.
(7) The Swedish authorities have provided the necessary information on the implementation of the programme during the years 2001 and 2002 that shows its effective implementation.
(8) The Swedish authorities presented on 31 May 2002 a programme for Community financial assistance during 2003, and a revised programme on 2 September 2002. On this basis, it appears appropriate to fix the financial assistance provided by the Community for the period 1 January 2003 up to 31 December 2003 up to a maximum of EUR 160000.
(9) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, veterinary and plant health measures undertaken in accordance with Community rules shall be financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund; for financial control purposes, Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 apply.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2), and in particular Article 5(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1630/2003(4), provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies is to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) Luxembourg still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/2004 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the Luxembourg intervention agency available on the internal market, which had earlier been destined for export under Regulation (EC) No 1735/98(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1241/2000(6), and to repeal that Regulation.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender; in addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.
(6) When the Luxembourg intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.

of 7 May 1990
amending Regulation (EEC) N° 1035/72 on the common organization of the  market in fruit and vegetables
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas provision should be made for a simpler procedure for drawing up the list of products which  are to be the subject of common quality standards;
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) N° 1035/72 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N°  1119/89 (5), lays down provisions regarding producers' organizations;
Whereas, with a view to making up for the shortcomings of the market for citrus fruit observed in  certain regions of production in the Community, further conditions on the recognition of citrus  producers' organizations should be laid down; whereas those conditions are likely to ensure  that
such organizations contribute, in particular by improving
their efficiency, towards  re-establishing balance between production and demand on the market; whereas, to
that end, those  conditions must include in particular
total concentration of supply and adequate regulation of  production and of placing on the market and the necessary provisions to ensure that such  organizations provide proof
of sufficient economic activity; whereas, with a view to
that  objective, such organizations must be required to incorporate in their rules of association precise  clauses guaranteeing producers control of decisions and the operation of the organization and  clauses penalizing infringements of the rules laid down; whereas recognized producers'  organizations should be given a period to adapt to the new provisions; whereas it should therefore  be specified that the Member States should verify compliance of the producers' organizations with  the overall provisions applicable to them;
Whereas experience has shown that citrus fruit withdrawn from the market is normally not disposed  of in accordance with the facilities provided for in Article 21 of Regulation
(EEC) No  1035/72; whereas the citrus fruit harvest is staggered over the marketing year; whereas provision  should be made for a structure to enable producers' organizations to plan, rationalize and check  withdrawal operations where the production and market situations so require and to improve the  conditions under which recourse is had to the possibilities of free disposal;
Whereas Article 15a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 provides that preventive withdrawals of  apples and pears may be authorized under certain conditions; whereas paragraphs 3 and 4 of that  Article provide that those arrangements are to apply until 30 June 1990; whereas the Commission  will forward to the Council before that date a report on the way those arrangements function;  whereas such a report has been drawn up; whereas it shows that the arrangements have beneficial  effects on the marketing years for the products concerned; whereas those arrangements should  therefore be made permanent;
Whereas, pursuant to Articles 16 (4), 18 (1) and 19 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, the prices  at which products are bought in under Articles 19 and 19a and the financial compensation paid under  Article 18 of that Regulation are to be calculated on the basis of the buying-in price multiplied  by conversion factors;
Whereas producers must be encouraged to deliver their surplus products for processing;
Whereas the differences in upgrading of the product as a result of the application of the  conversion factors were established for the needs of the market for products consumed fresh and are  not relevant for processing;
Whereas there should no longer be varying withdrawal prices for lemons according to size or form of  packaging and provision should be made for the withdrawal price of such products to be that of  products of mixed sizings, in bulk in a means of transport;
Whereas withdrawals of citrus fruit in certain regions and in particular of mandarins and lemons  have already attained a very high percentage of the marketable production of the members of certain  producers' organizations; whereas the withdrawal system is only an exceptional instrument for  monitoring the market and does not in itself constitute a method of disposal; whereas the financial  compensation paid in respect of such withdrawals should be limited where it appears that a  producers' organization has not fulfilled its basic objective of marketing the production of its  members; whereas such a measure should be applied progressively in order to permit producers'  organizations experiencing operating problems to adapt to it;
Whereas Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) N° 1035/72 provides that certain classes of blood oranges,  withdrawn from the market under Articles 15b and 18 thereof or bought in in accordance with  Articles 19 and 19a thereof, may be disposed of to the processing industry under certain  conditions; whereas that possibility has not been made use of since the 1979/80 marketing year;  whereas the provisions of Regulation (EEC) N° 2601/69 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N°  1123/89 (2), are better suited to encouraging the processing of such blood oranges; whereas the  former provision should be amended;
Whereas, in order to improve the conditions under which recourse is had to possibilities of free  disposal provided for in Article 21 of Regulation (EEC) N° 1035/72, on the one hand provision  should be made for the possibility of the Community's defraying the costs of sorting and packaging  the products in question and on the other hand
the Member States should be encouraged to organize  contacts between producers' organizations and establishments or charitable organizations; whereas  in view of the characteristics of the harvest and of marketing and of the level of withdrawals of  apples and citrus fruit, those provisions should apply only to those products,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1193/90 of 7 May 1990 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 on the Common Organization of the market in fruit and vegetables', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nTitle I of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

fixing the export refunds on beef and veal
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 33(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
(3) The second subparagraph of Article 33(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products should also comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3), and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 of 20 July 1982 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals (5), the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 36/2008 (6) should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'header': '18.4.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 108/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 343/2008\nof 17 April 2008\nfixing the export refunds on beef and veal', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 33(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.\n\n((3)) The second subparagraph of Article 33(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.\n\n((4)) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin(2).

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Hving regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
Whereas operational and accidental pollution by sea-going oil tankers is still occurring and the transport of oil by tankers of conventional oil tank design poses a continuous threat to the marine environment;
Whereas internationally agreed rules for the design and operation of environmentally-friendly oil tankers were established under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO);
Whereas the operation of environmentally-friendly oil tankers benefits both coastal States and the industry;
Whereas international conventions contain requirements for the certification of oil tankers; whereas the method of measuring the tonnage of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers has been developed further by the IMO;
Whereas all but one of the Member States have ratified and implemented the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and the Protocol of 1978 related thereto (Marpol 73/78); whereas all Member States have ratified and  implemented the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969;
Whereas Resolution A.722(17) adopted by the Assembly of IMO on 6 November 1991 and its successor, Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurement of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers, adopted by the Assembly of IMO on 4 November  1993, express a general desire to encourage the design of environmentally-friendly tankers and the use of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers;
Whereas in Resolution A.747(18) the IMO Assembly (i) invited Governments to advise the port and harbour authorities to apply its recommendation of deducting the tonnage of the segregated ballast tanks when assessing fees based on the gross tonnage for  all tankers with segregated ballast capacity in accordance with Regulation 13 of Annex I of Marpol 73/78 and (ii) invited Governments also to advise pilotage authorities to take action in accordance with the recommendation;
Whereas the Council recognized the need for intensified action, as appropriate, at Community or national level to ensure an adequate response to the requirements of maritime safety and the prevention of marine pollution; whereas it is desirable to  promote the use of double hull oil tankers or oil tankers of an alternative design fulfilling the requirements of Regulation 13F of Annex I of Marpol 73/78 as amended on 6 March 1992, as well as segregated ballast oil tankers;
Whereas double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design should be treated for the purpose of this Regulation as if their segregated ballast tanks complied with Regulation 13 of Annex I of Marpol 73/78;
Whereas it is inappropriate to penalize shipowners and operators for using oil tankers which are environmentally-friendly in design and operation;
Whereas, in particular, the charging of dues on the tonnage of segregated ballast tanks of oil tankers, where those tanks are not used for the carriage of cargo, constitutes a financial disadvantage for those who have taken an important step towards a  cleaner environment;
Whereas, for economic reasons, individual harbour authorities are reluctant to be placed at a disadvantage by being the only ones to implement the IMO Resolution;
Whereas IMO Resolutions A.722(17) and A.747(18) have been agreed, but not implemented by all Member States;
Whereas for the purpose of protecting the marine environment from pollution by oil tankers of a conventional design, there should be unified implementaion in the Community of internationally agreed rules concerning the charging of levies on oil tankers  by port and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities;
Whereas, in order to avoid distortion of competition within the Community and to reach efficient and cost-effective solutions, concerted action for unified implementation of the internationally agreed rules, in accordance with the principle of  subsidiarity, can best be established by means of a Regulation;
Whereas the flag State or other bodies issuing the International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate and the International Tonnage Certificate (1969), as well as the shipowners and persons who charge levies on oil tankers must work togehter in  implementing IMO Resolution A.747(18) in order to enhance protection of the marine environment;
Whereas systems have already been established in some Member States for reducing levies on environmentally-friendly vessels on a basis other than IMO Resolution A.747(18); whereas in accordance with the spirit of that Resolution, an alternative scheme  for tonnage-based fees should be provided for consisting in a percentage differential from the normal tariff, so that the average difference will be at least the same as that which is envisaged by the Resolution; whereas it should furthermore be ensured  that segregated ballast oil tankers are always given no less favourable treatment even where fees are not caculated on the basis of tonnage,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2978/94 of 21 November 1994 on the implementation of IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurement of ballast spaces in segregated ballast oil tankers', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPort and harbour authorities and pilotage authorities within the Community shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation:\n\n(a) implement within the Community IMO Resolution A.747(18) on the application of tonnage measurements of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers, adopted by the Assembly of the Intenational Maritime Organization (IMO) on 4 November 1993, whose Annex is  contained in Annex I to this Regulation, in order to encourage the use of oil tankers with segregated ballast tanks, including double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design; or\n\n(b) apply reduction schemes for levies charged on segregated ballast oil tankers different from, but in the spirit of, IMO Resolution A.747(18).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall apply to oil tankers which:\n\n- can carry segregated ballast in specially appointed tanks,\n\n- are designed, built adapted, equipped and operated as segregated ballast oil tankers including double hull oil tankers and oil tankers of an alternative design,\n\n- meet the requirements of the International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships 1969, and\n\n- hold the International Tonnage Certificate, (1969).'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2697/2000(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 70/524/EEC provides that new additives and new uses of additives may be authorised following the review of an application made in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive.
(2) Article 9e(1) of the Directive provides that provisional authorisation of a new additive or new use of an additive may be given if the conditions of Article 3a(b) to (e) are satisfied and if it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that when used in animal nutrition it has one of the effects referred to in Article 2(a). Such provisional authorisation may be given for a period up to four years in the case of additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to the Directive.
(3) The assessment of the dossiers submitted in respect of the new uses of the enzyme and micro-organism preparations described in Annexes I and II shows that they satisfy the abovementioned conditions and may therefore be authorised on a provisional basis for a four-year period.
(4) New data were submitted to extend the authorisation of an enzyme preparation provisionally listed under No 11 to a new physical form. The assessment of the dossier submitted shows that the new physical form may be provisionally authorised.
(5) On 1 October 2000, the authorisation of the micro-organism preparation No 1 Bacillus cereus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40 112) was provisionally renewed for a limited period, in order to provide sufficient time for the safety reassessment of the strain with regard to production of toxins, as requested in the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) on the safety of use of bacillus species in animal nutrition adopted on 17 February 2000.
(6) According to the SCAN opinion on Bacillus cereus var. toyoi (NCIMB 40 112) adopted on 21 March 2001, the assessment of the dossiers submitted shows that the product may be considered safe as regard toxin production. The provisional authorisation of the product may therefore be resumed.
(7) Article 2(aaa) of Directive 70/524/EEC requires authorisations for coccidiostats to be linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation.
(8) Article 9b of Directive 70/524/EEC provides that the authorisations of such substances shall be given for a period of 10 years from the date on which final authorisation takes effect, if all conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC are met.
(9) The assessment of the dossier submitted shows that the coccidiostat described in Annex IV satisfies all the requirements of Article 3a, when used in the animal category and under the conditions described in the said Annex.
(10) The assessment of the dossier shows that certain procedures may be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives. Such protection should however be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(3).
(11) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety of the enzyme and micro-organism preparations and of the coccidiostat, and with regard to the favourable effect on animal production of the latter, under the conditions described in the said Annex.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (1), in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) established, inter alia, maximum levels for the contaminant benzo(a)pyrene.
(2) The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted an opinion on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Food on 9 June 2008 (3). The EFSA concluded that benzo(a)pyrene is not a suitable marker for the occurrence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in food and that a system of four specific substances or eight specific substances would be the most suitable markers of PAH in food. The EFSA also concluded that a system of eight substances would not provide much added value compared to a system of four substances.
(3) As a consequence Commission Regulation (EU) No 835/2011 (4) amended Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 in order to set maximum levels for the sum of four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and chrysene).
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 (5) lays down analytical performance criteria only for benzo(a)pyrene. It is therefore necessary to lay down analytical performance criteria for the other three substances for which maximum levels are now set out in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006.
(5) The European Union Reference Laboratory for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (EU-RL PAH) in collaboration with the national reference laboratories carried out a survey among official control laboratories to assess which analytical performance criteria would be achievable for benzo(a)pyrene, benz(a)anthracene, benzo(b)fluoranthene and chrysene in relevant food matrices. The outcome of this survey was summarised by the EU-RL PAH in the Report on ‘Performance characteristics of analysis methods for the determination of 4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in food’ (6). The results of the survey show that the analytical performance criteria currently applicable to benzo(a)pyrene are also suitable for the other three substances.
(6) Experience acquired while implementing Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 revealed that in some cases the current sampling provisions may be impracticable or may lead to unacceptable economic damage to the sampled lot. For such cases, departure from the sampling procedures should be allowed, provided that sampling remains sufficiently representative of the sampled lot or sublot and that the procedure used is fully documented. For sampling at the retail stage, flexibility to depart from the sampling procedures existed already. The provisions for sampling at retail stage should be aligned with the general sampling procedures.
(7) More detailed provisions are needed as regards the material of sampling containers when samples are taken for PAH analysis. Plastic containers are widely used by enforcement authorities, but they are not suitable when sampling is carried out for PAH analysis, as the PAH content of the sample can be altered by these materials.
(8) Clarification is needed for some aspects of the specific requirements for analytical methods, in particular the requirements regarding the use of the performance criteria and the ‘fitness-for-purpose’ approach. Furthermore, the presentation of the tables with the performance criteria should be modified to appear more uniform across all analytes.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly. Since Regulation (EU) No 835/2011 and this Regulation are inter-linked, both Regulations should become applicable on the same date.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '20.8.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 215/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 836/2011\nof 19 August 2011\namending Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 laying down the methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, inorganic tin, 3-MCPD and benzo(a)pyrene in foodstuffs\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2)established, inter alia, maximum levels for the contaminant benzo(a)pyrene.\n\n((2)) The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted an opinion on Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Food on 9 June 2008(3).

Taking into account that the weight of the lot is not always an exact multiple of the weight of the sublots, the weight of the sublot may exceed the mentioned weight by a maximum of 20\xa0%.\nB.2.2.\nNumber of incremental samples\nThe aggregate sample shall be at least 1\xa0kg or 1 litre except where it is not possible, e.g. when the sample consists of 1 package or unit.\nThe minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot or sublot shall be as given in Table 3.\nIn the case of bulk liquid products the lot or sublot shall be thoroughly mixed in so far as possible and in so far it does not affect the quality of the product, by either manual or mechanical means immediately prior to sampling. In this case, a homogeneous distribution of contaminants is assumed within a given lot or sublot. It is therefore sufficient to take three incremental samples from a lot or sublot to form the aggregate sample.\nThe incremental samples shall be of similar weight/volume.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2874/77 of 19 December 1977 laying down special measures in respect of castor seeds (1), and in particular Article 2 (4) and Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 2 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2874/77 requires the adoption of general rules for granting aid, detailed rules for checking entitlement to the aid and the necessary conditions which seed processing undertakings must meet in order to be entitled to aid; whereas Article 3 thereof requires that the criteria for determining the world market price be laid down;
Whereas the world market price must be determined on the basis of the most favourable purchasing possibilities on that market;
Whereas the relevant figures should be those recorded during the marketing period for Community seed for offers on the world market and prices quoted on the major international exchanges; whereas, however, those offers which cannot be considered representative of the true trend of the market should be disregarded;
Whereas, if there are no representative offers or prices for castor seed, the world market price for castor seed should be determined on the basis of the value of the products resulting from its processing; whereas if the offers and prices for castor seed on the world market might jeopardize the sale of Community-produced castor seed, the world market price should be determined on the basis of the value of the average quantities of oil and oil-cake derived from the processing of castor seed less the processing costs; whereas, if there are no offers and no prices for castor seed, oil and oilcake, the world market price for castor seed should be determined at the same level as the guide price;
Whereas, to ensure the proper operation of the aid system, the world market price must be recorded for a Community frontier crossing point; whereas in fixing this point account should be taken of the extent to which it is representative for imports of such seed and therefore the port of Rotterdam should be chosen; whereas offers and prices will have to be adjusted if they relate to a different frontier crossing point;
Whereas such adjustments should also be made to the offers and prices adopted in order to compensate for any variation from the presentation and quality criteria used when fixing the guide price;
Whereas, with an eye to the proper operation of the aid system, it should be specified that aid shall be granted for the exact quantity of castor seed harvested and processed in the Community and to undertakings whose stock accounts allow the quantity of Community processed seed to be verified if the contract between such undertakings and producers has been lodged with the competent agency in the Member State in which the seed is produced;
Whereas the right to aid is acquired at the time of processing of the seed; whereas, however, it should be specified that the aid may be advanced to the interested parties before the products are processed; whereas in order to prevent fraud it is necessary to specify that a guarantee must be given to ensure the processing of the products for which the aid is paid;
Whereas the producer Member States and the Member States in which the seed will be processed should be required to set up the control arrangements necessary to ensure the proper operation of the aid system; whereas the control arrangements should be in particular allow checks to be made upon the observance of the minimum price referred to in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2874/77 and unjustified applications for aid to be prevented; whereas for the purposes of control Member States shall assist each other;
Whereas special provision should be made for checks upon seed which is processed in a Member State other than that in which it is produced,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1853/78 of 25 July 1978 adopting general rules in connection with special measures for castor seeds', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Article 2 of Directive 76/893/EEC provides that materials and articles must not transfer their constituents to foodstuffs in quantities which could endanger human health;
Whereas Article 3 of the same Directive provides that the Council, under the procedure provided for in Article 100 of the Treaty, shall adopt by means of Directives special provisions applicable to certain groups of materials and articles (specific Directives);
Whereas in most of the Member States ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs are subject to mandatory provisions for protecting human health which lay down limits for the extractable quantities of lead and cadmium;
Whereas these provisions vary from one Member State to another, thus creating obstacles to the establishment and functioning of the common market;
Whereas these obstacles may be eliminated if the placing of ceramic articles on the Community market is made subject to uniform rules; whereas it is therefore necessary to harmonize the limit values and the test and analysis methods for such articles;
Whereas the appropriate instrument for attaining this objective is a specific Directive within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive 76/893/EEC the general provisions of which also become applicable in this particular case;
Whereas the adaptation to technical progress of certain checking and analysis measures provided for in the Directive is an implementing measure the adoption of which should be entrusted to the Commission in order to simplify and expedite the procedure;
Whereas, in all cases where the Council grants the Commission powers to implement provisions concerning materials and articles intended to come into
contact with foodstuffs, a procedure should be established to ensure close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs set up by the Council Decision of 13 November 1969,","{'title': 'Council Directive 84/500/EEC of 15 October 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/71/EC(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Directive 2002/71/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/64/EC(5), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The existing active substance metsulfuron methyl, was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 2000/49/EC(6), for use as herbicides, but without specifying particular conditions having an impact on crops which may be treated with plant protection products containing this active substance.
(2) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to this use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(3) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing this active substance may be authorised.
(4) With respect to the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substance concerned, the related technical and scientific evaluations were finalised in the form of Commission review report. The report was finalised on 16 June 2000. The report fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for metsulfuron methyl at 0,22 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(7) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(8) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs being exceeded. No acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an Acute Reference Dose were noted during the evaluation and discussion preceding the inclusion of metsulfuron methyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional MRLs at the lower limit of analytical determination for all such products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC.
(6) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for metsulfuron methyl in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.
(7) The Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The Commission notified this Directive in draft form to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received have been considered in finalising the Directive. The possibility of fixing import tolerance MRLs for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the acceptable data submitted.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2439/1999(2), and in particular Article 9h(3)(b) and Article 9i(3)(b), thereof,
Whereas:
(1) because of the risk for human and animal health posed by the circulation in the Community of poor copies of zootechnical additives, Directive 70/524/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 96/51/EC(3), provides for the linking of the authorisation of certain classes of additives to the person responsible for putting them into circulation;
(2) in particular Article 9h of Directive 70/524/EEC provides for the replacement of the provisional authorisations of additives included in Annex I after 31 December 1987 and belonging to the group of antibiotics and transferred to Chapter II of Annex B, by authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation for a period of ten years;
(3) in particular Article 9i of Directive 70/524/EEC provides for the replacement of the provisional authorisations of additives included in Annex II before 1 April 1998 and belonging to the group of antibiotics and transferred to Chapter III of Annex B by provisional authorisations linked to the person responsable for putting them into circulation;
(4) the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were the subject of new applications for authorisation by the person responsible for the dossier on the basis of which the former authorisations were given or by their successors. The applications relating to those additives were accompanied by the required monographs and identification notes;
(5) the linking of the authorisation to a person responsible for putting the additive into circulation is based on a purely administrative procedure and did not entail a fresh assessment of the additives. Although the authorisations under this Regulations are granted for a specified period, they may be withdrawn at any time in accordance with Article 9m and Article 11 of Directive 70/524/EEC.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2077/85(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1631/2000(4), lays down detailed rules for applying the system of production aid established by Regulation (EEC) No 525/77 and in particular specifies the products on which the aid is payable.
(2) The minimum price and the production aid for tinned pineapple should be fixed for the 2001/02 marketing year in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 525/77.
(3) Article 1(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2077/85 defines two types of tinned pineapple on which the aid is payable. On the basis of the Commission's information, Community production of tinned pineapple as defined in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation will be nil for the 2001/02 marketing year.

of 12 March 2001
on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 94 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses(3) has been substantially amended(4). In the interests of clarity and rationality, it should therefore be codified.
(2) Economic trends are bringing in their wake, at both national and Community level, changes in the structure of undertakings, through transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses to other employers as a result of legal transfers or mergers.
(3) It is necessary to provide for the protection of employees in the event of a change of employer, in particular, to ensure that their rights are safeguarded.
(4) Differences still remain in the Member States as regards the extent of the protection of employees in this respect and these differences should be reduced.
(5) The Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers adopted on 9 December 1989 (""Social Charter"") states, in points 7, 17 and 18 in particular that: ""The completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in the European Community. The improvement must cover, where necessary, the development of certain aspects of employment regulations such as procedures for collective redundancies and those regarding bankruptcies. Information, consultation and participation for workers must be developed along appropriate lines, taking account of the practice in force in the various Member States. Such information, consultation and participation must be implemented in due time, particularly in connection with restructuring operations in undertakings or in cases of mergers having an impact on the employment of workers"".
(6) In 1977 the Council adopted Directive 77/187/EEC to promote the harmonisation of the relevant national laws ensuring the safeguarding of the rights of employees and requiring transferors and transferees to inform and consult employees' representatives in good time.
(7) That Directive was subsequently amended in the light of the impact of the internal market, the legislative tendencies of the Member States with regard to the rescue of undertakings in economic difficulties, the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, Council Directive 75/129/EEC of 17 February 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies(5) and the legislation already in force in most Member States.
(8) Considerations of legal security and transparency required that the legal concept of transfer be clarified in the light of the case-law of the Court of Justice. Such clarification has not altered the scope of Directive 77/187/EEC as interpreted by the Court of Justice.
(9) The Social Charter recognises the importance of the fight against all forms of discrimination, especially based on sex, colour, race, opinion and creed.
(10) This Directive should be without prejudice to the time limits set out in Annex I Part B within which the Member States are to comply with Directive 77/187/EEC, and the act amending it,","{'title': ""Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) The revision of Directive 97/68/EC is currently being prepared by the Commission in line with the requirements of Article 2 of Directive 2004/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC (4). In order to ensure that the revised Directive is in line with Union standards for good air quality, and in the light of experience, scientific findings and available technologies, the Commission should, in the upcoming revision of Directive 97/68/EC and subject to impact assessment, consider:
— establishing a new emission stage – Stage V – that should be based, subject to technical feasibility, on the requirements of Euro VI standards for heavy-duty vehicles,
— introducing new requirements for the reduction of particulate matter, namely a particulate number limit that applies for all compression ignition engine categories, where technically feasible, so as to ensure an effective reduction of ultra-fine particles,
— taking a comprehensive approach to promoting emission-reducing provisions and retrofitting of after-treatment systems on the existing fleet of non-road mobile machinery on the basis of the currently ongoing discussions under the auspices of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe regarding harmonised requirements for retrofit emission control devices; this approach should support Member States’ efforts to improve air quality and to promote the protection of workers,
— establishing a method providing for the periodic testing of non-road mobile machinery and vehicles, in particular to establish whether their emissions performance complies with the values given at registration,
— the possibility of authorising, under certain conditions, replacement engines that do not comply with Stage III A requirements for railcars and locomotives,
— the possibility of harmonising the specific emission standards for rail with relevant standards at international level so as to ensure the availability of affordable engines that comply with the emission limits set.
(3) The transition to Stage III B involves a step change in technology requiring significant implementation costs for redesigning the engines and for developing advanced technical solutions. However, the current global financial and economic crisis or any conjunctural economic fluctuations should not lead to a lowering of environmental standards. This revision of Directive 97/68/EC should therefore be considered to be exceptional. Furthermore, investments in environmentally friendly technologies are important for the promotion of future growth, jobs and health security.
(4) Directive 97/68/EC provides for a flexibility scheme to allow equipment manufacturers to purchase, in the period between two emission stages, a limited number of engines that do not comply with the emission limits applicable during that period, but which are approved in accordance with the requirements of the stage immediately preceding the applicable one.
(5) Point (b) of Article 2 of Directive 2004/26/EC provides for the evaluation of the possible need for additional flexibilities.
(6) During Stage III B, the maximum number of engines used for applications other than the propulsion of railcars, locomotives and inland waterways vessels that may be placed on the market under the flexibility scheme should be increased, in each engine category, from 20 % to 37,5 % of the annual quantity of equipment with engines in that category that is placed on the market by the equipment manufacturer. An optional alternative of placing a fixed number of engines on the market under the flexibility scheme should be available. That fixed number of engines should also be revised and should not exceed the ceilings laid down in Section 1.2.2 of Annex XIII to Directive 97/68/EC.
(7) The rules applicable to the flexibility scheme should be adapted to extend the application of that scheme to engines for use in the propulsion of locomotives for a strictly limited period of time.
(8) Improving air quality is a major Union goal pursued through Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe (5). Tackling emissions at source is essential for meeting that goal, including reducing emissions from the non-road mobile machinery sector.
(9) Enterprises operating with machines that fall within the scope of this Directive should benefit from European financial support programmes or any relevant support programmes provided by Member States. Those support programmes should be aimed at favouring the early introduction of the highest emission standards.
(10) Directive 97/68/EC provides for an exemption for replacement engines, which does not apply to railcars and locomotives. However, considering weight and dimensional constraints, it is necessary to provide for a limited exemption also for replacement engines in railcars and locomotives.
(11) The measures set out in this Directive reflect a temporary difficulty faced by the manufacturing sector, resulting in no permanent adaptation, and as such, the application of those measures should be restricted to the duration of Stage III B or, where no subsequent stage exists, to 3 years.
(12) Taking into account the special infrastructure of the United Kingdom rail network, which results in a different structural gauge and consequently weight and dimensional constraints, and therefore requires a longer adaptation period for the new emission limits, it is appropriate to provide for more flexibility for this particular market in engines for use in locomotives.
(13) Directive 97/68/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '23.11.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 305/1', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2011/88/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 November 2011\namending Directive 97/68/EC as regards the provisions for engines placed on the market under the flexibility scheme\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery(3)concerns exhaust emissions and emission limits of air pollutants from engines installed in non-road mobile machinery and contributes to the protection of human health and the environment.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December 1999,
Whereas:
(1) Article 174 of the Treaty provides that one of the objectives of Community action is to ensure a prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources.
(2) At its meeting on 29 October 1990 the Council set an objective of stabilising total CO2 emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level in the Community as a whole.
(3) The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change contains further commitments for the Community and its Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
(4) To achieve significant reductions in Community CO2 emissions further efforts will have to be made, particularly since CO2 emissions due to energy consumption are expected to increase by about 3 % between 1995 and 2000, assuming normal economic growth; therefore, additional measures are indispensable.
(5) Council Decision 93/389/EEC(4) established a monitoring mechanism of Community CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions.
(6) The Commission, in its communication of 8 February 1990 on energy and the environment, highlighted energy efficiency as the cornerstone of future efforts to reduce the negative impact of energy on the environment. The communication of the Commission of 29 April 1998 on ""Energy efficiency in the European Community - Towards a strategy for the rational use of energy"" underlined the economic potential for energy efficiency with the aim of refocusing attention on promoting energy efficiency,
(7) Improvement in the management of energy, above all enabling the extensive potential for reduction of energy intensity to be exploited, is urgently needed in order to contribute to the protection of the environment, to a better security of energy supply and to sustainable development.
(8) The Commission has communicated to the European Parliament and the Council, by means of the Green Paper of 11 January 1995 and the White Paper of 13 December 1995, its views on the future of energy policy in the Community, and the role of energy-saving and energy efficiency measures.
(9) Article 158 of the Treaty provides that the Community is to develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion, and that it should, in particular, reduce disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions; those actions cover, inter alia, the energy sector.
(10) By Decision 91/565/EEC(5) and Decision 96/737/EC(6), the Council adopted a Community energy efficiency programme (SAVE) aimed at strengthening energy efficiency infrastructures within the Community.
(11) The SAVE programme is an important and necessary instrument for promoting increased energy efficiency.
(12) Provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998 to 2002) adopted by Council Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom(7) for a specific programme for the encouragement of rational and efficient use of energy resources; this specific programme would replace the corresponding instrument currently in force.
(13) The Community recognised the SAVE programme as an important element of the Community's CO2 reduction strategy. The communication of the Commission of 8 May 1991 on the European Community's energy programming activities at regional level, the conclusion of the Council on this communication, and the Resolution of the European Parliament of 16 July 1993(8) stated that those activities should be pursued, amplified and utilised as a support for the energy strategy of the Community; this initiative for regional actions should now be totally incorporated.
(14) In implementing Decision No 182/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 1998 concerning the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998 to 2002)(9), Council Decision 1999/170/EC of 25 January 1999 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration on energy, environment and sustainable development (1998 to 2002)(10) devotes particular attention to efficient and renewable energy technologies; the SAVE programme represents a policy instrument which complements that programme.
(15) The SAVE programme aims at improving energy intensity of final consumption by a further one percentage point per annum over that which would have been otherwise attained.
(16) At its meeting on 15 and 16 December 1994 the Council stated that the target of stabilising CO2 emissions can only be achieved by a coordinated package of measures to improve energy efficiency and the rational use of energy which are based on supply and demand at all levels of energy production, conversion, transport and consumption and to exploit renewable energies, and that local energy management programmes are amongst these measures;
(17) In its Resolution of 10 October 1999 on the Commission's Green Paper on energy policy(11), the European Parliament called for the formulation of objectives and a common programme for energy efficiency and savings compatible with the objectives concerning the emissions of greenhouse gases as agreed in Rio de Janeiro (1992), Berlin (1995) and subsequently in Kyoto (1997), called for a SAVE II programme endowed with considerably more resources than the SAVE I programme and requested that the Commission clarify the role which it intends to play in energy savings and efficiency by creating practical projects.
(18) Improved energy efficiency will have a positive impact on both the environment and the security of energy supplies which are global in nature; a high level of international cooperation is needed to produce the most positive results.
(19) Between 180 and 200 million tonnes of CO2 emissions could be avoided by the year 2000 by an improvement of 5 % in the energy intensity of final demand additional to the conventional expectations; such figures could be increased by a more efficient and rational use of energy sources.
(20) It is politically and economically desirable to open the programme to the associated central and eastern European countries, in accordance with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of 21 and 22 June 1993 and confirmed by subsequent European Councils, and as outlined in the Commission communication on that subject in May 1994, and also to Cyprus.
(21) In order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work avoided, the Commission will ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; it will systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects and of complementary activities in the field of renewable energy sources.
(22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(12);
(23) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the principal point of reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999(13), on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, for the budgetary authority during the budgetary procedure.
(24) This Decision replaces Council Decision 96/737/EC which should accordingly be repealed,","{'title': 'Decision No 647/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 February 2000 adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency (SAVE) (1998 to 2002)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emissions performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community’s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular Article 12(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The supplier Automotive Lighting Reutlingen GmbH (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of the light emitting diodes (LEDs) low beam module, ‘E-Light’, as an innovative technology on 9 July 2013. The completeness of the application was assessed in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 (2). The application was found to be complete and the period for the Commission’s assessment of the application started on the day following the date of official receipt, i.e. 10 July 2013.
(2) The application has been assessed in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 and the Technical Guidelines for the preparation of applications for the approval of innovative technologies pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (the Technical Guidelines) (3).
(3) The application refers to the LED low beam module ‘E-Light’, which is a lighting technology based on a so called refraction-reflection system. The E-Light module uses the reflection and refraction of light through lenses to concentrate the light produced by small number of LED lamps. This technology is significantly different from the LED lighting system approved as an eco-innovation in Commission Implementing Decision 2013/128/EU (4). It should also be noted that the application by Automotive Lighting is based on the simplified approach described in the Technical Guidelines, whereas the previously approved application was based on the comprehensive approach.
(4) The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.
(5) The Applicant has demonstrated that the use of the E-Light module in passenger cars did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009. In support of this the Applicant has referred to the Technical Guidelines, which provides for the summary of the CLEPA LIGHT Sight Safety report. The Applicant has used predefined functions and averaged data in line with the simplified approach specified in the Technical Guidelines.
(6) The Applicant has in accordance with the simplified approach described in the Technical Guidelines used halogen lighting as baseline technology for demonstrating the CO2 reducing capacity of the ‘E-Light’ module.
(7) The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO2 reductions which includes formulae that are consistent with the formulae described in the Technical Guidelines for the simplified approach with regard to lighting functions. The Commission considers that the testing methodology will provide testing results that are verifiable, repeatable and comparable and that it is capable of demonstrating in a realistic manner the CO2 emissions benefits of the innovative technology with strong statistical significance in accordance with Article 6 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.
(8) Against that background the Commission finds that the Applicant has demonstrated satisfactorily that the emission reduction achieved by the innovative technology is at least 1 g CO2/km.
(9) Since the activation of the lighting in the low beam is not required for the CO2 emissions type approval test referred to in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (6), the Commission is satisfied that the lighting functions in question are not covered by the standard test cycle.
(10) The activation of the lighting functions concerned is mandatory to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle and as a consequence not dependant on the choice of the driver. On that basis the Commission finds that the manufacturer should be considered accountable for the CO2 emission reduction due to the use of the LEDs.
(11) The Commission finds that the verification report has been prepared by FAKT S.r.l. which is an independent and certified body and that the report supports the findings set out in the application.
(12) Against that background, the Commission finds that no objections should be raised as regards the approval of the innovative technology in question.
(13) Any manufacturer wishing to benefit from a reduction of its average specific CO2 emissions for the purpose of meeting its specific emissions target by means of the CO2 savings from the use of the innovative technology approved by this Decision, should in accordance with Article 11(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011, refer to this Decision in its application for an EC type-approval certificate for the vehicles concerned,","{'header': '11.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 70/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 10 March 2014\non the approval of the light emitting diodes low beam module ‘E-Light’ as an innovative technology for reducing CO2emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/128/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The supplier Automotive Lighting Reutlingen GmbH (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of the light emitting diodes (LEDs) low beam module, ‘E-Light’, as an innovative technology on 9 July 2013.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (1), and in particular Article 5(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Procedures for landing and weighing have been developed in close cooperation between the Community and Norway and the Faeroe Islands. These are established in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 (2). The scope of those rules was limited to the stocks which were subject to cooperation with Norway and the Faeroe Islands. However, the zones corresponding to the southern component of mackerel and horse mackerel, as well as other zones subject to catch limitations were not covered. It is appropriate to extend the scope of those rules to all zones where catch limitations are established and where the conservation status of the stocks and the need to ensure effective control so require.
(2) According to Article 9 paragraph 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007, a weighing logbook is to be kept by the party weighing the fish, but there is no indication as to the time-frame for complying with this obligation. In order to avoid any uncertainty in the interpretation of this provision, a clear deadline for the completion of the logbook should be specified.
(3) According to Article 9 paragraph 3(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007, each tanker load used to transport fish from the quayside to the processing plant is to be weighed and recorded separately. However, to avoid undue delay to the discharge of the cargo, it should be made possible to only record the total weight of all tanker loads from the same vessel provided that these tanker loads are weighed consecutively and without interruption.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Article 60 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (3) establishes the general rules for the weighing of fisheries products and empowers the Commission to adopt detailed rules for its application. Considering that this Article will only apply from 1 January 2011 and having regard to the urgency for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1542/2007 to apply during the 2010 fishing season, it is appropriate to make use of Article 5(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2847/93 as legal basis for this amendment.

establishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Food Aid Committee as regards the extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999
(2010/316/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 214(4) and Article 218(9) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Food Aid Convention 1999 was concluded on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2000/421/EC (1) and extended by decisions of the Food Aid Committee in June 2003, June 2005, June 2007, June 2008 and June 2009 so as to remain in force until 30 June 2010.
(2) The Grains Trade Convention 1995 remains in force until 30 June 2011.
(3) The Food Aid Convention 1999 expires on 30 June 2010 and the question of its renewal will be formally addressed at the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee on 4 June 2010.
(4) At the 101st Session of the Food Aid Committee, on 9 December 2009, some members expressed their willingness to extend the Food Aid Convention 1999 for another year until 30 June 2011. The European Union took the position that it would work towards taking a decision in June 2010 as to the future of the Food Aid Convention 1999 and that preparations could be started immediately without any prejudice to the formal position that would be communicated at the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee in June 2010.
(5) There are two possible scenarios for which the European Union should prepare a position in view of the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee:
(a) discussions among members of the Food Aid Committee on the future of the Food Aid Convention 1999 have achieved significant progress (i.e. there is reasonable expectation that renegotiation of the Food Aid Convention 1999/negotiation of a future Convention will start in the course of 2010), by the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee, in which case an extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999 for one more year would be most appropriate. The Commission would then initiate the procedure laid down in Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recommending that the Council authorise the opening of negotiations and adopt negotiating directives; or
(b) discussions among members of the Food Aid Committee on the future of the Food Aid Convention 1999 have not achieved significant progress by the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee, in which case an extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999 for one more year would not be appropriate, and the Commission, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States, should formally oppose the emergence of a consensus in the Food Aid Committee favouring an extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999.
(6) The Commission, which represents the European Union in the Food Aid Committee, should therefore be authorised by a Council Decision to either favour an extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999 for one year, i.e. until 30 June 2011, if the condition set out in paragraph 5(a) is met, or, if that is not the case, oppose a consensus in the Food Aid Committee favouring such an extension,","{'header': '10.6.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 142/7', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 3 June 2010\nestablishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the Food Aid Committee as regards the extension of the Food Aid Convention 1999\n(2010/316/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Food Aid Convention 1999 was concluded on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2000/421/EC(1)and extended by decisions of the Food Aid Committee in June 2003, June 2005, June 2007, June 2008 and June 2009 so as to remain in force until 30 June 2010.\n\n((2)) The Grains Trade Convention 1995 remains in force until 30 June 2011.\n\n((3)) The Food Aid Convention 1999 expires on 30 June 2010 and the question of its renewal will be formally addressed at the 102nd Session of the Food Aid Committee on 4 June 2010.\n\n((4)) At the 101st Session of the Food Aid Committee, on 9 December 2009, some members expressed their willingness to extend the Food Aid Convention 1999 for another year until 30 June 2011.

The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds, and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the refund amount to be fixed by tendering procedure.
(3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 299/95(4), apply to this invitation to tender.
(4) In order to avoid disturbances on the markets of the producing countries, the invitation to tender should be limited to certain zones specified in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6).
(5) Pursuant to Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2452/2000(8), amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article specify the operative events applicable to advances and securities.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 697/93 (2), and in particular Articles 8 (5), 10 (3), 14 (5), 15  (8), 17 (6), 23 (5) and 30 thereof,
Whereas the Commission has to be able to monitor the price stabilization activities of the producers' organizations and the way in which they apply the systems of financial compensation and carry-over premiums;
Whereas the Community intervention arrangements pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 require information to be available on the prices recorded on the wholesale markets and in representative ports of the Community;
Whereas the markets and ports of the Member States to be considered representative for a given product have to be established;
Whereas it is also necessary to stipulate how frequently the market prices are to be recorded and related notifications made;
Whereas improved organization has led to an increase in the number of notifications relating to the application and monitoring of Community intervention arrangements in the common organization of the markets;

Whereas it is necessary to have certain data available in order to establish the flat-rate aid; whereas the communication of this data is provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 4176/88 of 28 December 1988 setting down detailed rules of  application for the granting of flat-rate aid for certain fishery products (5); whereas, since various provisions of that Regulation have been regrouped in this Regulation, Article 15 thereof should be repealed;

(2) The European Council adopted Declarations on 4 February and 11 March 2011, and Conclusions on 24-25 March 2011 expressing the Union’s intention to support all steps towards democratic transformation in its Southern Neighbourhood and to develop a new partnership with the region.
(3) The Council adopted conclusions on 21 February 2011 on developments in the Southern Neighbourhood, and on 20 June 2011 on the European Neighbourhood Policy, welcoming the proposal of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR) for a European Union Special Representative for the Southern Mediterranean region.
(4) The HR and the European Commission have put forward proposals for a Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity and a new approach to partnership with the Union’s neighbours through the European Neighbourhood Policy in their Communications of 8 March and 25 May 2011.

It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.
(2) The SCCP further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.
(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products, according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.
(4) Substances for which updated safety files were submitted are currently being evaluated by the SCCP. For 17 hair dye substances final opinions have already been given by the SCCP. Therefore, definitive regulation of these hair dye substances, on the basis of such evaluations, can take place.

Therefore, definitive regulation of these hair dye substances, on the basis of such evaluations, can take place.\n\n((5)) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex III to Directive 76/768/EEC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 15 November 2009 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 160/2012
of 23 February 2012
fixing for 2012 the amount of aid in advance for private storage of butter
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 43(a) and (d), in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the granting of private storage aid for butter.
(2) Developments in prices and stocks of butter indicate an imbalance in the market which may be eliminated or reduced by the seasonal storage. In view of the current market situation, it is appropriate to grant aid for private storage of butter as from 1 March 2012.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products (2) has established common rules for the implementation of a private storage aid scheme.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in Chapter III of that Regulation.
(5) In accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 the aid should be fixed in the light of storage costs and the likely trends in prices for fresh butter and butter from stocks.
(6) It is appropriate to fix aid for the costs for entry and exit of the products concerned and for daily costs for cold storage and financing.
(7) To facilitate the implementation of the present measure and taking into consideration the existing practice in the Member States, the aid should relate only to products that have been fully placed into storage. Consequently, a derogation from Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be provided for.
(8) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, where the required information concerning storage details are already included in the application for aid, it is appropriate to waive the request to notify the same information after the conclusion of the contract as provided for in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.
(9) For reasons of simplification and logistic efficiency, Member States should be allowed to waive the requirement to mark the contract number on each unit stored where the contracts number is entered in the stores register.
(10) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, taking into account the particular situation for butter storage, the checks provided for in Article 36(6) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be carried out in respect of at least one half of the contracts. Consequently, a derogation from that Article should be provided for.

Those rules cover in particular the obligation for the Member States to use the information systems made available by the Commission and the validation of the access rights of the authorities or individuals authorised to send notifications. In addition, that Regulation sets common principles applying to the information systems in order to guarantee the authenticity, integrity and legibility over time of the documents. It also provides for personal data protection.
(12) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 the obligation to use the information systems in accordance with that Regulation has to be provided for in the Regulations establishing a specific notification obligation.
(13) The Commission has developed an information system that allows managing documents and procedures electronically in its own internal working procedures and in its relations with the authorities involved in the common agricultural policy.
(14) It is considered that notification obligations for the private storage of butter can be fulfilled via that system in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 792/2009, in particular those provided for in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.
(15) For reasons of clarity, this Regulation should expire on the final date laid down for the end of contractual storage.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 6 September 1984
approving aids from the United Kingdom for the coal-mining industry during the 1983/84 financial year
(Only the English text is authentic)
(84/456/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 528/76/ECSC of 25 February 1976 regarding the Community system of measures taken by the Member States to assist the coal-mining industry (1),
Having consulted the Council,
I
Whereas the United Kingdom Government has informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 2 of the above Decision, of the financial measures which it intends to implement directly or indirectly for the benefit of the coal industry during the 1983/84 financial year (2); whereas the following of these measures may be approved pursuant to the Decision:
1.2 //   // (£ million)  // - aid for the recruitment and retention of skilled workers:  // 16,9  // - aid to cover losses on mining:  // 415,0
Whereas these aids meet the criteria laid down in the Decision for the admissibility of such State assistance;
Whereas the aid for attracting and keeping skilled workers is intended to offset in part the National Coal Board's costs arising from rationalization and the transfer of production to their best pits. This results in outgoings on removals, transport, etc.;
Whereas the United Kingdom Government is to contribute £ 16 900 000 towards such costs borne by the NCB in 1983/84;
Whereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 8 of the Decision;
Whereas the aid given to cover losses on mining (£ 415 000 000) will almost completely cover the losses sustained by NCB pits in 1983/84. The aid is given to avoid serious economic and social problems in those coalfields where there are not yet adequate re-employment opportunities and to maintain existing production capacities so as to safeguard energy supplies. The aid is therefore compatible with Article 12 of the Decision;
II
Whereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the abovementioned aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in the 1983/84 financial year;
Whereas aids for current production in the United Kingdom will amount to 719 900 000 ECU or 5,88 ECU per tonne for the 1983/84 financial year; whereas the British coal industry therefore receives the lowest subsidy of all coal-producing Member States;
Whereas an examination of the compatibility of these aids with the proper functioning of the common market requires no detailed information or investigation:
- there were no supply difficulties on the British market in 1983/84,
- British coal exports to other Community countries fell slightly in 1983/84 compared with 1982/83,
- the closure of 10 unprofitable pits resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest,
- industrial consumers of coal did not receive indirect aids in 1983/84 as a result of the prices of British coking coal and steam coal;
Whereas it can therefore be stated that the aids for the British coal industry for current production in the 1983/84 financial year are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;
Whereas this also applies when account is taken of aids to the coal industry pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC;
III
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ascertain that aids authorized are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must be informed in particular of the amount of these aids and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '84/456/ECSC: Commission Decision of 6 September 1984 approving aids from the United Kingdom for the coal-mining industry during the 1983/84 financial year (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe United Kingdom is hereby authorized in respect of the 1983/84 financial year to grant aids totalling £ 431 900 000 to the British coal-mining industry.\n\nThe said aids are made up as follows:\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 103za, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 103n(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 foresees that, by 1 August 2013, Member States may decide to reduce, from 2015, the amount available for the support programmes referred to in Annex Xb in order to increase their national ceilings for directs payments referred to in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (2). The amount resulting from the decrease is to remain definitively in the national ceilings for direct payments and no longer be available for the measures listed in Articles 103p to 103y of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(2) Article 103o of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 foresees that Member States were to decide by 1 December 2012 whether to provide support to vine-growers for 2014 by allocating payment entitlements within the meaning of Chapter 1 of Title III of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. In this case, Member States are to make provision for such support in their support programmes and this support for 2014 is to remain in the Single Payment Scheme and no longer be available for the measures in Articles 103p to 103y of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Commission Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 (3) should provide details on the communications to be made by the Member States concerned in relation to Article 103n(1a) and Article 103o of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) In the light of the experience gained during the implementation of the support programmes and in order to prepare for the submission of draft support programmes for the financial years 2014 to 2018, the framework and specific requirements for the new programming period should be further completed.
(4) Point (d) of the first paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 provides that the wines referred to in Article 103p(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be eligible for promotion on third-country markets provided that the support for promotion and information lasts no longer than three years for a given beneficiary in a given third country, if necessary renewed once for a period no longer than two years. This provision has been applied for the first submission of the support programme and it is appropriate to provide a similar rule for the submission of the new support programme; however, it is important to stimulate the opening of new markets in third countries, including by giving preference to beneficiaries who did not receive support in the past, or to those targeting a new third country for which they have not received support in the past within this scheme.
(5) The third paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 provides that, when selecting the beneficiaries, preference is to be given to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (4) and to collective brand names. The preference for collective brand names should be eliminated in order to simplify the implementation of this measure, while leaving the possibility to grant support for the promotion of brand names unaffected.
(6) Articles 6 and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 establish rules concerning the definition, the procedure, applications and levels of support for restructuring and conversion of vineyards. Without prejudice to the conditions set out in Article 103q of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, in the light of the experience gained during the implementation of this measure, it is necessary to specify certain operations that are considered ineligible. Furthermore, the rules on the calculation of flat rate amounts should, on the one hand, be simplified and, on the other, be made more precise. In particular, in order to avoid overcompensation, it is appropriate to specify that flat rate amounts shall be based on an accurate calculation of the actual costs of each type of operation.
(7) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 establishes transitional rules concerning restructuring operations already planned in application to Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (5). Those rules are now outdated and that Article should therefore be deleted.
(8) Articles 26 to 34 establish rules for three measures which ended on 31 July 2012, potable alcohol distillation, crisis distillation and use of concentrated grape must. Those Articles should therefore be deleted.
(9) Articles 67 to 73 establish rules for the grubbing-up scheme which ended in 2011. Those Articles should therefore be deleted.
(10) Article 77(5) of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 foresees that, for investment measures, Articles 26, 27 and 28 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1975/2006 (6) should apply mutatis mutandis. However, in the light of Article 19(1) and Articles 76 to 80 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008, the reference to some of those rules, which are now set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 (7), should be deleted in order to improve clarity.
(11) Article 81(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 foresees rules on controls related to the production potential and to the operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards, for areas receiving a grubbing-up premium in accordance with Articles 85o to 85x of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. The grubbing-up scheme ended in 2011. Therefore, those rules should be deleted. However, Article 81(4) foresees an on-the-spot control or a remote sensing control in case of grubbing-up, if its resolution is equal to or higher than 1 m2 or the grubbing-up covers the entire vineyard parcel. Grubbing-up before replanting can also be an operation carried out in the framework of a restructuring and conversion measure and therefore it is appropriate to foresee the same rule for this measure.
(12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2001 (8) provided the simplified VI-1 document for wine products, including grape juice originating in a list of countries, including the United States of America, and imported into the Union. Since the entry into force of the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on trade in wine (9), wine from the United States of America can be imported into the Union accompanied by a certification document as provided for in Article 9 of the Agreement. In consequence, in Regulation (EC) No 555/2008, which replaced Regulation (EC) No 883/2001, the United States of America were not included in the list of countries allowed to use the simplified VI-1 document. However, as grape juice is not covered by that Agreement, the United States of America should be added to that list for the benefit of wine products not covered by the scope of the Agreement.

The amount resulting from the decrease is to remain definitively in the national ceilings for direct payments and no longer be available for the measures listed in Articles 103p to 103y of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n\n((2)) Article 103o of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 foresees that Member States were to decide by 1 December 2012 whether to provide support to vine-growers for 2014 by allocating payment entitlements within the meaning of Chapter 1 of Title III of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. In this case, Member States are to make provision for such support in their support programmes and this support for 2014 is to remain in the Single Payment Scheme and no longer be available for the measures in Articles 103p to 103y of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Commission Regulation (EC) No 555/2008(3)should provide details on the communications to be made by the Member States concerned in relation to Article 103n(1a) and Article 103o of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n\n((3)) In the light of the experience gained during the implementation of the support programmes and in order to prepare for the submission of draft support programmes for the financial years 2014 to 2018, the framework and specific requirements for the new programming period should be further completed.\n\n((4)) Point (d) of the first paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 provides that the wines referred to in Article 103p(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 shall be eligible for promotion on third-country markets provided that the support for promotion and information lasts no longer than three years for a given beneficiary in a given third country, if necessary renewed once for a period no longer than two years. This provision has been applied for the first submission of the support programme and it is appropriate to provide a similar rule for the submission of the new support programme; however, it is important to stimulate the opening of new markets in third countries, including by giving preference to beneficiaries who did not receive support in the past, or to those targeting a new third country for which they have not received support in the past within this scheme.\n\n((5)) The third paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 provides that, when selecting the beneficiaries, preference is to be given to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC(4)and to collective brand names. The preference for collective brand names should be eliminated in order to simplify the implementation of this measure, while leaving the possibility to grant support for the promotion of brand names unaffected.\n\n((6)) Articles 6 and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 establish rules concerning the definition, the procedure, applications and levels of support for restructuring and conversion of vineyards. Without prejudice to the conditions set out in Article 103q of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, in the light of the experience gained during the implementation of this measure, it is necessary to specify certain operations that are considered ineligible. Furthermore, the rules on the calculation of flat rate amounts should, on the one hand, be simplified and, on the other, be made more precise. In particular, in order to avoid overcompensation, it is appropriate to specify that flat rate amounts shall be based on an accurate calculation of the actual costs of each type of operation.\n\n((7)) Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 establishes transitional rules concerning restructuring operations already planned in application to Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(5). Those rules are now outdated and that Article should therefore be deleted.\n\n((8)) Articles 26 to 34 establish rules for three measures which ended on 31 July 2012, potable alcohol distillation, crisis distillation and use of concentrated grape must. Those Articles should therefore be deleted.\n\n((9)) Articles 67 to 73 establish rules for the grubbing-up scheme which ended in 2011. Those Articles should therefore be deleted.\n\n((10)) Article 77(5) of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 foresees that, for investment measures, Articles 26, 27 and 28 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1975/2006(6)should applymutatis mutandis. However, in the light of Article 19(1) and Articles 76 to 80 of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008, the reference to some of those rules, which are now set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 65/2011(7), should be deleted in order to improve clarity.\n\n((11)) Article 81(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 foresees rules on controls related to the production potential and to the operations of restructuring and conversion of vineyards, for areas receiving a grubbing-up premium in accordance with Articles 85o to 85x of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. The grubbing-up scheme ended in 2011. Therefore, those rules should be deleted. However, Article 81(4) foresees an on-the-spot control or a remote sensing control in case of grubbing-up, if its resolution is equal to or higher than 1\xa0m2or the grubbing-up covers the entire vineyard parcel. Grubbing-up before replanting can also be an operation carried out in the framework of a restructuring and conversion measure and therefore it is appropriate to foresee the same rule for this measure.\n\n((12)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2001(8)provided the simplified VI-1 document for wine products, including grape juice originating in a list of countries, including the United States of America, and imported into the Union. Since the entry into force of the Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on trade in wine(9), wine from the United States of America can be imported into the Union accompanied by a certification document as provided for in Article 9 of the Agreement. In consequence, in Regulation (EC) No 555/2008, which replaced Regulation (EC) No 883/2001, the United States of America were not included in the list of countries allowed to use the simplified VI-1 document. However, as grape juice is not covered by that Agreement, the United States of America should be added to that list for the benefit of wine products not covered by the scope of the Agreement.\n\n((13)) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Ineligible operations', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 555/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 2, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:\n‘3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States deciding to reduce, from the 2015 financial year onwards, the amount available for the support programmes in order to increase their national ceilings for direct payments referred to in Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009\n(\n*1\n)\n, shall notify these amounts before 1 August 2013.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation of Zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) From the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 2 April 2009 it results that Zinc chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment for chickens for fattening (2). The Authority further concluded that that product used as a feed additive for chickens for fattening does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion in combination with the one of 16 April 2008 (3), the use of that preparation may be considered as a source of available Zinc and fulfils the criteria of a nutritional additive for chickens for fattening. The Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established to provide additional support for workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation and to assist them with their reintegration into the labour market.
(2) The scope of the EGF was broadened for applications submitted from 1 May 2009 to include support for workers made redundant as a direct result of the global financial and economic crisis.
(3) The Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 allows the mobilisation of the EGF within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million.
(4) The Netherlands submitted an application on 30 December 2009 to mobilise the EGF, in respect of redundancies in two enterprises operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 18 (printing and reproduction of recorded media) in the NUTS II region Drenthe (NL13) and supplemented it with additional information up to 6 May 2010.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 9264 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(5), should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2119/2002 of 28 November 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWith the exception of the quantity of 9264 tonnes provided for in the Annex, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 29 November 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 November 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(2) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(3) OJ L 154, 15.6.1976, p. 11.\n\n(4) OJ L 117, 24.5.1995, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ L 194, 23.7.2002, p. 22.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 28 November 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\n\nR01 Switzerland, Liechtenstein, communes of Livigno and Campione d\'Italia.\n\nR02 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Ex-Spanish Sahara, Cyprus, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, West Bank/Gaza Strip, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine, Kazakstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nR03 Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Bermuda, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, A40, A11 except Suriname, Guyana, Madagascar.'}]}"

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PENDING REQUESTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 11 OF REGULATION (EC) No 88/97
(1) When Regulation (EC) No 71/97 entered into force, the Commission had pending a number of applications pursuant to Article 13 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 from bicycle assemblers, seeking exemption from the extension to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 (hereinafter referred to as 'the extended anti-dumping duty`) of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 (5). Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 88/97 listed the parties whose requests were considered admissible pursuant to Article 11 thereof.
(2) The Commission requested and received the necessary information from those parties and verified it where necessary at the premises of the parties concerned. The examination of the merits of the requests in the light of Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 showed that, for all of these parties, the value of the bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of parts used. The examination also showed that for some parties the value added to the parts brought in exceeded 25 % of the manufacturing costs of the finished bicycles.
(3) In view of these findings, pursuant to Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the parties listed in Annex A to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. The parties concerned were informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment.
(4) In accordance with Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the parties listed in Annex A to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty as from 20 April 1996 and the parties' customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty shall be considered void as from that date.
B. REQUESTS PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 3 OF REGULATION (EC) No 88/97
(5) After the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 a number of bicycle assemblers submitted requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty. The Commission published in the Official Journal of the European Communities a list of applicants (6) for which payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5 (1) of that Regulation.
(6) The Commission requested and received the necessary information from the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision and found their requests admissible according to Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97. The parties were duly informed of the admissibility of their requests. The information provided was examined and verified where necessary at the premises of the parties concerned.
(7) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that the assembly operations of the applicants concerned do not fall within the scope of Article 13 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96. That is so because, for all the applicants' bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People's Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations, while for some applicants the value added to the parts brought in exceeded 25 % of the manufacturing costs of the finished bicycles.
(8) For the above reasons, and in accordance with Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97, the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty. The parties concerned were informed accordingly and given an opportunity to comment.
(9) In accordance with Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 88/97 the parties listed in Annex B to this Decision should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty as from the date of receipt of their request and the parties' customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from that date.
C. INFORMATION TO INTERESTED PARTIES

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin. In particular, it provides that products of animal origin are only to be imported from a third country or a part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists, account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees by the competent authorities of third countries as regards compliance or equivalence with Union feed and food law and animal health rules specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) sets maximum levels for contaminants in a range of foodstuffs.
(2) Taking into account the different interpretations with regard to the portion of crabs to be analysed for comparison with the maximum level for cadmium, it should therefore be clarified that the maximum level set for cadmium in crustaceans in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 applies to muscle meat from appendages (legs and claws) and abdomen. For crabs and crab-like crustaceans, the maximum level applies to the appendages only. This definition excludes other parts of crustaceans, such as the cephalothorax of crabs and inedible parts (shell, tail). The cephalothorax comprises the digestive organs (hepatopancreas) which are known to contain high levels of cadmium. As in some Member States consumers may eat parts of the cephalothorax on a regular basis, consumer advice at a Member State level to limit consumption of these parts may be appropriate to reduce exposure to cadmium. An Information Note on this issue has been made available on the website of the Health and Consumers Directorate General of the European Commission (3).
(3) For reasons of consistency the portion of crustaceans to which the maximum levels apply should be modified for other contaminants (lead, mercury, dioxins and PCBs and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) accordingly.
(4) Bivalve molluscs such as green shell mussels and oysters can accumulate cadmium similarly to seaweed. Since green shell mussel powder and oyster powder, like dried seaweed, are sold as food supplements, the maximum level for cadmium in dried bivalve mollusc should be the same as the one currently established for dried seaweed and products derived from seaweed.
(5) The provisions for leafy brassica should be aligned with those of other leaf vegetables. Leafy brassica should therefore be excluded from the default maximum level for cadmium in ‘vegetables and fruit’ in point 3.2.15 and should be included in point 3.2.17.
(6) The default maximum levels for lead and cadmium in fruit and vegetables are not realistic for seaweed, which can naturally contain higher levels. Seaweed should therefore be exempted from the default maximum levels for lead and cadmium in fruit and vegetables (points 3.1.10 and 3.2.15). More occurrence data should be collected to decide about the need for specific more realistic maximum levels for lead and cadmium in seaweed.
(7) Some inconsistencies exist with regard to the names of the foodstuffs/product groups in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 and the names of the foodstuffs/product groups listed in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (4). Since Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 refers to the product groups listed in Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 these names should be aligned to that Regulation.
(8) It is appropriate to update the provisions on monitoring and reporting taking into account recent monitoring recommendations on ethylcarbamate (5), perfluoroalkylated substances (6), and acrylamide (7). Since Commission Decision 2006/504/EC (8) has been repealed and replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1152/2009 (9), the reference to Decision 2006/504/EC should be replaced by a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1152/2009. Furthermore, it should be clarified which data is reported to the Commission and which to EFSA.

Objectives of the programme\n\nWithin the general framework of developing the processing and marketing facilities the aims of the restructuring are with regard to:\n\n- marine species\n\n- the improvement of the infrastructure including fish auction facilities,\n\n- the introduction of modern processing and packing facilities including smoking installations,\n\n- extension of buildings for processing equipment;\n\n- freshwater species\n\n- investment in building facilities for integrated processing (washing, smoking, packing, etc.),\n\n- investment in transport facilities for live fish,\n\n- investment in facilities for a valorization of byproducts (eggs, offal, etc.).\n\n5.

The Commission considers that the programme submitted by Belgium as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis, to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of resources and of the consequences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n\n2. Given that the structural measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture foreseen for 1987 and later may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for the processing and marketing of fish products.\n\n3. With regard to trout and carp the Commission can only adopt the programme on condition that the forecast investment provides for a significant element of value added in the final product. This forecast should be accompanied by a detailed market analysis clearly demonstrating that a viable, stable market exists for those products.\n\nWith regard to eel and salmon the attention of the Belgian authorities is drawn to the development of the rearing of these species in other Member countries in view of a possible change of the import pattern which at present is characterized by large imports from third countries.\n\n4. Furthermore, the investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n\n5. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product.\n\n6. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in this programme do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community.'}]}"

(2) Annex II, Part B to Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 has laid down rules concerning the grouping of the economic size classes. Those rules limit the possibilities for the Member States to establish more suitable selection plans.
(3) Some descriptions and names used in Annex I and Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1242/2008 lack legibility and need therefore to be clarified.

Article 3a of Decision 90/424/EEC, provides for a Community financial contribution to Member States to cover certain costs involved in taking measures to eradicate avian influenza.
(2) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in the United Kingdom in 2007. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community’s livestock population. The United Kingdom took measures, as referred to in Article 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, to combat those outbreaks.
(3) The payment of a Community financial contribution must be made subject to the condition that the planned measures were actually implemented and that the competent authorities provided all the necessary information to the Commission within certain deadlines.
(4) In accordance with Article 3a(3) of Decision 90/424/EEC, the Community financial contribution should be 50 % of the eligible costs incurred by the Member State.
(5) The United Kingdom has fully complied with its technical and administrative obligations as set out in Articles 3(3) and 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 95(6) thereof,
Whereas:
I. FACTS
1. Community legislation: Directive 98/79/EC
(1) Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices(1) lays down harmonised rules concerning the safety, health protection an performance, characteristics and authorisation procedures for in vitro diagnostic medical devices, with a view to their placing on the market and putting into service.
(2) Directive 98/79/EC stipulates in Article 2 that the Member States shall take all necessary steps to ensure that devices may be placed on the market and/or put into service only if they comply with the requirements laid down by the Directive when duly supplied and properly installed, maintained and used in accordance with their intended purpose.
(3) Directive 98/79/EC stipulates in Article 4 that the Member States shall not create any obstacle to the placing on the market or the putting into service within their territory of devices bearing the EC marking indicating that they are considered to meet the requirements set out in the Directive.
(4) Directive 98/79/EC, in Annex I, contains specific labelling requirements related to the product and its characteristics, including instructions for a proper and safe use. These requirements aim, among others, to inform users of the residual risks in relation with the product, as also to provide information on the identification of the device, on any special microbiological state, particular storage or handling conditions, particular operating instructions and appropriate precautions to take.
2. The notified national provisions
(5) The United Kingdom intends to maintain in force national provisions concerning HIV testing kits. These provisions are set out in the HIV testing kits and services regulations 1992 (SI 1992/460 - 1992 Regulations) and apply since 1 April 1992.
(6) The notification of the United Kingdom relates to ""those provisions of the 1992 Regulations that potentially relate to the free movement of goods"". These are, according to the notification, the provisions, that make it an offence within the UK, to sell, supply or advertise, for sale or supply, a HIV testing kit or any component part of such a kit to a member of the public (Article 2 of the Regulations) and also these, that make it an offence to sell or supply a HIV testing kit that is not accompanied at the time of sale or supply in the United Kingdom by a notice indicating that it may not be supplied to a member of the public (Article 3(2)(a) of the Regulations), that a positive test should not be relied upon unless confirmed by at least one other test result, and that a negative test may not have detected recently acquired HIV (Article 3(2)(b) and (c) of the Regulations).
(7) The United Kingdom justifies its request by referring to the protection of life and public health. They consider it necessary to ensure the quality of HIV Testing Services and to underpin Government public health policy on HIV. In that context, individuals taking HIV tests should have the opportunity to receive pre-test discussion and post (positive) test counselling with a trained health care professional. Such discussions allow for the impact and consequences of a positive HIV test to be dealt with and for the communication of important advice on the prevention of transmission.
II. PROCEDURE
(8) Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted on 27 October 1998. Member States has to adopt and publish the national provisions necessary to comply with the Directive before 7 December 1999 and to apply them with effect from 7 June 2000.
(9) Article 95(4) of the Treaty reads as follows: ""If, after the adoption by the Council or by the Commission of a harmonisation measure, a Member State deems it necessary to maintain national provisions on grounds of major needs referred to in Article 30, or relating to the protection of the environment or the working environment, it shall notify the Commission of these provisions as well as the grounds for maintaining them"".
(10) By letter of 31 July 2001, the United Kingdom Permanent Representation informed the Commission, in accordance with Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty, that the United Kingdom intends to maintain in force the HIV Testing Kits and Services Regulations 1992. This notification was received on 1 August 2001.
(11) According to Article 95(6) of the Treaty, the six months period for the examination of the notification under Article 95(4) starts on 2 August 2001, the day following the one when the notification was received.
III. ASSESSMENT
(12) The notification submitted by the United Kingdom authorities on 31 July 2001 intends to maintain in force national provisions after the adoption of Directive 98/79/EC, which constitutes a harmonisation measure adopted on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty (ex Article 100A).
(13) Directive 98/79/EC provides for the prohibition of any restriction regarding the placing on the market or the putting into service of devices complying with the Directive. Article 2 of the Regulations introduce restrictions to the distribution of HIV testing kits, limiting their availability to the medical profession. Directive 98/79/EC does not contain any rules concerning the distribution of in vitro diagnostic medical devices after their placing on the market or their putting into service. Consequently, the national measure corresponding to Article 2 of the Regulations does not fall under the scope of Directive 98/79/EC.
(14) The labelling requirements of Directive 98/79/EC, are related to the product and its characteristics. They concern, among others, its proper and safe use, particular storage or handling conditions, instructions for use and particular operating instructions and also any other relevant information related to the product. The notified national measures, as far as they require a notice indicating that the product must not be sold or supplied to a member of the public, intend to give information regarding restrictions to the distribution of the HIV testing kits. Directive 98/79/EC does not contain neither any provisions regarding the distribution of in vitro diagnostic medical devices, nor any labelling requirements regarding their distribution and marketing. Consequently, this national measure, corresponding to Article 3(2)(a) of the Regulations, does not fall under the scope of Directive 98/79/EC.
(15) The labelling requirements of Directive 98/79/EC aim, among others, to inform users of the residual risks in relation with the product. They impose information on a proper and safe use, on appropriate precautions to take. This should include the possibility of false positive or false negative result. The notified national measures, as far as they require a warning, drawing the attention of the users to a possible fault positive or negative result, intend to give information concerning the risks related to the product. Consequently, the national measures, corresponding to Article 3(2)(b) and (c) of the Regulations, implement Directive 98/79/EC.
IV. CONCLUSION
(16) Article 95(6) of the EC Treaty, aims at approving or rejecting a national measure that derogates from a harmonisation measure. National provisions that are either falling outside the scope of a harmonisation Directive or intended to implement such a Directive cannot be assessed under this procedure.
(17) In the light of the above considerations and without prejudice to any assessment that the Commission can make as regards the compatibility of the notified national measures with the EC Treaty, the Commission is of the opinion that the notification of the United Kingdom for maintaining the measures in the HIV Testing Kits and Services Regulations 1992, as submitted on 31 July 2001, with reference to Article 95(4) of the Treaty, is inadmissible,","{'title': '2002/65/EC: Commission Decision of 25 January 2002 on the national provisions concerning HIV testing kits notified under Article 95(4) of the EC Treaty by the United Kingdom as regards Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 297)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe notification concerning the maintenance of the notified measures in the HIV Testing Kits and Services Regulations 1992, which the United Kingdom submitted to the Commission on 31 July 2001, on the basis of Article 95(4) of the Treaty, is hereby declared inadmissible.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 January 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nErkki Liikanen\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 331, 7.12.1998, p. 1.'}]}"

PROVISIONS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME\n\nA. Provisions on the financial implementation\n\n1. The Commission's intention is to establish real cooperation with the authorities responsible for the implementation of the programme. In line with the programme these authorities are those indicated below.\n\nCommitment and payments\n\n2. Portugal guarantees that, for all action co-financed by the Community, all public and private bodies involved in its management and implementation shall keep accounts in standard form of all transactions in order to facilitate monitoring of expenditure by the Community and the national authorities responsible for surveillance.\n\n3. The initial budgetary commitment shall be based on an indicative financial plan; this commitment shall be made for one year.\n\n4. The commitment will be made when the decision approving assistance is adopted by the Standing Committee on Plant Health under procedure Article 16a(a) of Council Directive 77/93/EEC(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/53/EC(2).\n\n5. The first instalment of EUR 200000 shall be paid to Portugal immediately after the official notification of the present Decision.\n\n6. The balance of the amount committed of EUR 200000 is paid on presentation to the Commission the final activity report and the detailed total expenditure incurred and after it has been approved by the Commission.\n\nAuthorities responsible for the implementation of the programme\n\n- Central administration:\n\nDirecção-Geral de Protecção das Culturas Quinta do Marquês P - 2780 Oeiras\n\n- Local administration:\n\nRegião Autónoma da Madeira\n\nSecretaria Regional da Agricultura, Florestas e Pescas\n\nDirecção Regional da Agricultura\n\nAv. Arriaga, 21 A\n\nEdifício Golden Gate, 4.o piso\n\nP - 9000 Funchal\n\n7. The actual expenditure incurred shall be notified to the Community broken down by type of action or subprogramme in a way demonstrating the link between the indicative financial plan and expenditure actually incurred. If Portugal keeps suitable computerised accounts this will be acceptable.\n\n8. All payments of aid granted by the Community under this Decision shall be made to the authority designated by Portugal, which will also be responsible for repayment to the Community of any excess amount.\n\n9. All commitments and payments shall be made in ecu.\n\nFinancial schedules for Community support frameworks and amounts of Community aid shall be expressed in euro. Payment shall be made to the following account:Banco BPI\n\nNo de conta 0010 370 03221820001\n\nTitular: Governo da Região Autónoma da Madeira Endereço: Av. de Zarco P - 9000 Funchal\n\nFinancial control\n\n10. Inspections may be carried out by the Commission or the Court of Auditors should it so request. Portugal and the Commission shall immediately exchange all relevant information in regard to the outcome of an inspection.\n\n11. For three years following the last payment relating to the assistance the authority responsible for implementation shall keep available to the Commission all documentary evidence of expenditure incurred.\n\n12. When it submits applications for payment Portugal shall make available to the Commission all official reports relating to supervision of the measures in question.\n\nReduction, suspension and withdrawal of aid\n\n13. Portugal and the recipients of aid shall declare that Community funds are used for the intended purposes. If implementation of a measure appears to require only part of the financial assistance allotted the Commission shall immediately recover the amount due. In cases of dispute the Commission shall examine the case within the partnership framework, asking Portugal or the other authorities designated by Portugal for implementation of the measure to submit their comments within two months.\n\n14. The Commission may reduce or suspend aid for a measure if the examination confirms the existence of an irregularity, in particular of a substantial modification affecting the nature or conditions of implementation of the measure for which approval by the Commission has not been sought.\n\nRecovery of undue payments\n\n15. All sums unduly paid must be reimbursed to the Community by the designated authority indicated in point 8. Interest may be levied on sums not reimbursed. If for any reason the designated authority indicated in point 8 does not reimburse the Community, Portugal shall pay the amount to the Commission.\n\nPrevention and detection of irregularities\n\n16. The partners shall observe a code of conduct drawn up by Portugal in order to ensure that any irregularity in the provision of the assistance programme is detected. Portugal shall ensure that:\n\n- suitable action is taken in this area,\n\n- any amount unduly paid as a result of an irregularity is recovered,\n\n- action is taken to prevent irregularities.\n\nB. Monitoring and assessment\n\nI. Monitoring Committee\n\n1. Establishment\n\nIndependent of the financing of this action, a monitoring committee for the programme shall be set up by Portugal and the Commission. It shall regularly review implementation of the programme and, in appropriate cases, propose any adjustments required.\n\n2. The Committee shall establish its own internal procedures within one month of the notification of the present decision to Portugal.\n\n3. Competence of Monitoring Committee\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- shall have as its general responsibility the satisfactory progress of the programme towards attainment of the objectives set. Its competence shall embrace the programme measures within the limits of the Community aid granted. It shall keep watch on respect for the regulatory provisions, including those on eligibility of operations and projects,\n\n- shall, on the basis of information on the selection of projects already approved and implemented, reach an opinion on application of the selection criteria set out in the programme,\n\n- shall propose any action required to accelerate implementation of the programme in the light of the information furnished periodically by the interim monitoring and assessment indicators,\n\n- may, in agreement with the Commission representative(s), adjust the financing plans within a limit of 15 % of the Community contribution to a subprogramme or measure for the entire period, or 20 % for any year, provided that the total amount scheduled in the programme is not exceeded. Care must be taken to see that the main objectives of the programme are not thereby compromised,\n\n- shall give its opinion on the adjustments proposed to the Commission,\n\n- shall issue an opinion on technical assistance projects scheduled in the operational programme,\n\n- shall give its opinion on draft final reports,\n\n- shall report regularly to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on the progress of the programme and expenditure incurred, at least twice during the relevant period.\n\nII. Monitoring and assessment of the programme during the implementation period (continuous monitoring and assessment)\n\n1. The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous monitoring and assessment of the programme.\n\n2. By continuous monitoring is meant an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realisation.\n\n3. Continuous assessment of the programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives.\n\nImplementation report and scrutiny of the programme\n\n4. Portugal shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final report.\n\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\n\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission before 31 March 2000 and shall thereafter be presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health as soon as possible after this date.\n\n5. The Commission may jointly with Portugal call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at point 3. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the subprogrammes and/or measures, modification of the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken. To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will not pay the entire cost of employing him.\n\nC. Information and publicity\n\nIn the framework of this programme, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicised.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n- make potential recipients and professional organisations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\n\nPortugal and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the Monitoring Committee.\n\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\n\nII. COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES\n\nCommunity policies applying in this field must be complied with.\n\nThe programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and compliance with Community policies. The following information must be supplied by Portugal.\n\n1. Award of public contracts\n\nThe public contracts(3) questionnaire must be completed for:\n\n- public contracts above the ceilings set by the supplies and works Directives that are awarded by contract-awarding authorities as defined in these Directives and are not covered by the exemptions specified therein,\n\n- public contracts below these ceilings where they constitute components of a single piece of work or of uniform supplies of a value above the ceiling. By a single piece of work is meant a product of building or civil engineering works intended in itself to fulfil an economic or technical function.\n\nThe ceilings in force are the ones at the date of the notification of this Decision.\n\n2. Protection of the environment\n\n(a) General information\n\n- description of the main environmental features and problems of the region concerned, giving a description of the important conservation areas (sensitive zones),\n\n- a comprehensive description of the major beneficial and harmful effects that the programme, given the investments planned, is likely to have on the environment,\n\n- a description of the action planned to prevent, reduce or offset any serious harmful effects on the environment,\n\n- a report on consultations with the responsible environmental authorities (opinion of the Ministry of the Environment or its equivalent) and, if there were any such consultations, with the public concerned.\n\n(b) Description of planned activities\n\nFor programme measures liable to have a significantly harmful effect on the environment:\n\n- the procedures which will be applied for assessing individual projects during implementation of the programme,\n\n- the mechanisms planned for monitoring environmental impact during implementation, assessing results and eliminating, reducing or offsetting harmful effects.\n\n(1) OJ L 26, 31.1.1977, p. 20.\n\n(2) OJ L 142, 5.4.1999, p. 29.\n\n(3) Notice C(88) 2510 to the Member States, on monitoring of compliance with procurement rules in the case of projects and programmes financed by the Structural Funds and financial instruments (OJ C 22, 28.1.1989, p. 3).""}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 234 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas the achievement of the Single Market requires the removal of all barriers to trade, not only between the Member States of the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 but also, to the greatest possible extent, between those Member States and  Spain and Portugal;
Whereas this will mean abolition for the supplementary trade mechanism applicable to cereals and rice, and where cereals are concerned makes it appropriate, in order to enable Portuguese farmers to meet increased competition for the other Member States,  to reduce over a longer period the aid provided for by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90 of 11 December 1990 introducing transitional measures governing the common organization of the market in cereals and rice in Portugal (2);
Whereas, under the reform of the common agricultural policy, provision was made for a reduction in intervention prices by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (3); whereas the resulting  loss of income is compensated for by direct support on a per hectare basis introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops (4); whereas the method of calculating  Portuguese aid should be adapted so as to avoid a double compensation;
Whereas accession compensatory amounts are due to be applied in trade in rice between Portugal and the other Member States until the end of the 1994/95 marketing year since Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90 provides for the price of the said product to be  aligned on the common price only with effect from that date;
Whereas price alignment for this product can be brought forward and all accession compenstory amounts can therefore be abolished on that date if the loss of earnings of Portuguese rice producers is offset by a similar aid scheme to that already provided  for cereals by Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90; whereas the arrangements provided for in that Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly;
Whereas to offset the difficulties that elimination of the supplementary trade mechanism for rice would otherwise involve for Portuguese producers the initial amount of the said aid should be set at more than the simple price difference of ECU 17,45 per  tonne and it should be made degressive to the end of the 1997/98 marketing year;
Whereas, at the same time, the fixed components applicable to products processed from cereals and rice until 31 December 1999 at the latest pursuant to the abovementioned Regulation should be abolished; whereas, in the case of most products, following  attainment of the single market the difficulties and cost of the monitoring required in connection with the components would be out of proportion to their size and they will not in fact be really necessary to protect the processing industry in Portugal;  whereas any difficulties that this may engender in the rice sector, particularly sensitive in Portugal, can be resolved within the framework of the transitional measures laid down;
Whereas this dismantling of the fixed components makes it appropriate to abolish the variations indicated in Article 287 (2) of the Act of Accession,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 738/93 of 17 March 1993 amending the transitional measures governing common organization of the market as provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 3653/90', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) Certain parts of the territory of China listed in Annex I of Decision 94/984/EC were allowed to use the model B certificate until an inspection revealed problems with certification; because of this, imports of fresh poultrymeat from China from 1 August 1996 were suspended by Commission Decision 96/456/EC.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 5(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 the use and the placing on the market of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) is prohibited.
(2) A competent authority of the United Kingdom requested on 14 February 2006, an exemption, until 31 December 2010, under Article 5(7) of regulation No 2037/2000 on behalf of AGC Chemicals Europe, Ltd.
(3) AGC Chemicals Europe, Ltd (ASAHI) is a supplier of the fluorinated resin Ethylene-tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE), which is used as insulating material for electrical wiring and as a raw material in the production of films ASAHI's committed and extensive research to identify a non-ozone depleting alternative to HCFC-225cb has shown good progress. Methanol is suggested as on alternative but the process requires further research and development before it can replace the use of HCFC-225cb. The current process recycles the HCFC-225cb and the HCFC-225cb left over is being recovered. Leakages in the atmosphere are strictly minimised.
(4) The Commission has thoroughly examined the technical and economic aspects of the manufacture of fluoropolymers for the purposes described by ASAHI and established that no technical and economically feasible alternative substance or technology is at present available and that the temporary use of HCFC-225cb remains essential for this particular application. Therefore, a temporary exemption to use and to place on the market of HCFC-225cb should be authorised.
(5) In its request for an exemption, ASAHI suggested an alternative and committed itself to implement that alternative before the expiry of the exemption. Provision should therefore be made for the competent authority to submit a report on the results in applying the relevant alternative. The obligation of the United Kingdom to monitor that implementation and an automatic termination of the exemption in case of a full implementation of that alternative should be foreseen.
(6) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 requires recovery of the ozone depleting substances. Under this Article, HCFC-225cb which would be left over in the process at the end of its use, shall be recovered from the installation consistent with Article 16. It should not be placed on the EC market and therefore returned to its producer at that time as foreseen by ASAHI.

Whereas:
(1) Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(c), (d) and (g) of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector (2).
(5) Export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third country's exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.

Whereas:
(1) In the United Kingdom, the quantity of available seed of varieties of blue lupin (Lupinus angustifolius) suitable to the national climatic conditions and satisfying the germination capacity requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient and is therefore not adequate to meet the needs of that Member State.
(2) It is not possible to meet the demand for seed of that species satisfactorily with seed from other Member States or from third countries which satisfies all the requirements laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC.

(4) In Finland, the quantity of available seed of varieties of linseed (Linum usitatissimum) suitable to national climatic conditions and satisfying the germination capacity requirements of Directive 2002/57/EC is insufficient and is therefore not adequate to meet the needs of that Member State.
(5) It is not possible to meet the demand for seed of that species satisfactorily with seed from other Member States or from third countries which satisfies all the requirements laid down in Directive 2002/57/EC.

(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(4) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (1), as last amended by Council Directive 80/1141/EEC of 8 December 1980 (2), and in particular Article 15 (2), (3) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to the application lodged by the Federal Republic of Germany,
Whereas under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive, seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1980 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, with effect from 31 December 1982, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) thereof provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the Federal Republic of Germany has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species;
Whereas the variety Kawetanya (sugar beet) and the concerned varieties of oats and of maize have not been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany in view of the German application;
Whereas the said variety of sugar beet has been the subject in the Federal Republic of Germany of an application for official acceptance in so far as their seed is to be marketed in another country (Article 4 (2) (b) thereof); whereas, therefore, even the applicant has not claimed that this variety has any satisfactory value for cultivation or use in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas, therefore, this variety can be treated as not producing results in the Federal Republic of Germany, which, with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (first subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) thereof);
Whereas the varieties of oats concerned are of the winter type; whereas the varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index over 350; whereas it is well known that the varieties of winter oats and the varieties of maize which have an FAO maturity class over 350 are at present not yet suitable for cultivation in view of all the kinds of utilization in the Federal Republic of Germany (second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive);
Whereas, in respect of the variety Checker (red fescue), the results of the trials show that in the Federal Republic of Germany, when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there, which apply within the framework of current Community provisions, it is not sufficiently uniform in certain characteristics (Article 15 (3) (a), third case, of the said Directive);

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

(2) In order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Community of out-of-quota sugar or isoglucose, Commission Regulation (EC) No 924/2008 of 19 September 2008 fixing the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2008/09 marketing year (3) excludes certain close destinations from the eligible destinations.

It is often the case with such exports that the standard customs documents cannot be obtained and the documents referred to in Article 4c of Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 are difficult to be provided.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(4) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 79/2003(4), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1683/2003 of 25 September 2003 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 26 September 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 September 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas Portugal suffered a severe drought between Autumn 1991 and Spring 1992 resulting, on the one hand, in almost total loss of the cereals harvest in certain regions and, on the other, in particular high additional costs for the feeding of cattle,  sheep, goats and horses in certain regions; whereas special aid schemes were introduced to mitigate the resulting loss of income to the producers concerned;
Whereas the drought continued until Spring 1993 in certain regions, with similar economic consequences for cereals producers and stockfarmers; whereas provision should therefore be made for special aid measures similar to those taken under Council  Regulation (EEC) No 3311/92 of 9 November 1992 on special measures for farmers affected by the 1991/92 drought in Portugal (3);
Whereas the economic consequences of the drought could slow down the integration of Portuguese agriculture into the common market organizations; whereas, in order to support Portuguese efforts to overcome the difficulties, the European Agricultural  Guidance and Guarantee Fund, (EAGGF) Guarantee Section, should make a financial contribution to the aid in question not exceeding the appropriations entered in the general budget of the European Communities for financing the measures provided for in  Regulation (EEC) No 3311/92 and carried over from 1993 to 1994 for the purpose;

The plan lays down in particular, for each of the Member States applying the measure, the maximum financial resources available to carry out its part of the plan, and the quantity of each type of product to be withdrawn from the stocks held by the intervention agencies.
(2) The plan should be adapted to allow Romania to be part of this Community action in 2007. For Romania, the adaptation should concern, on the one hand, the allocation of financial resources and the share of the products to be withdrawn from the intervention stocks and, on the other, the authorisation, on the conditions set out in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, of intra-Community transfers so that the modified plan can be implemented.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1539/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20, Levucell SC10 ME), as a feed additive for lambs, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 was authorised without a time limit for dairy cows and cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1200/2005 (2) and, until 22 March 2017, for dairy goats and dairy sheep by Commission Regulation (EC) No 226/2007 (3).
(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for lambs. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 16 July 2008 (4) that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20/Levucell SC10 ME) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. It further concluded that Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-1077 (Levucell SC20/Levucell SC10 ME) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is safe for lambs. That opinion also states that that preparation can produce a beneficial effect on final weight and average daily gain. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas rules on storage contracts for table wine dealing with their conclusion were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1059/83 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1997/84 (4);
Whereas Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 stipulates that producers may benefit from intervention measures only if they have complied for a reference period to be determined with the obligations imposed by Article 39 and, where appropriate, Articles 40 and 41 therein; whereas this reference period must therefore be fixed;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3537/84 (5) authorized the conclusion of long-term private storage contracts for table wine in respect of the 1984/85 wine-growing year;
Whereas the quantities of table wine in stock are large for the time of year; whereas this is due to the fact that stocks during the current wine-growing year are in some regions substantially higher than can be disposed of through the normal market outlets; whereas the forecasts for the coming harvest give little hope of relief of the market;
Whereas the wine under storage contracts is stored in containers which may be required to store the next harvest;
Whereas, in order that producers may store their next vintage under normal conditions aid should be granted for the re-storage of table wine, subject to a limitation as to distance;
Whereas, in order to limit this measure to cases where it appears economically justified, only storage contracts concluded or extended by the intervention agencies during a given period should be considered; whereas, in order to ensure that the measure operates correctly, provisions should also be adopted in respect of the nature of the transport and the date of submission of the application;
Whereas, since there is little time for administrative implementation and since the quantities involved are often small and the transport costs minimal by comparison with total costs, a standard amount of aid should be fixed;

authorising the Federal Republic of Germany to apply measures derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment
(2000/186/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(1), and in particular Article 27 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letters registered at the Commission's Secretariat-General on 8 January and 27 August 1999 respectively the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany communicated a request, under Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC to apply two measures derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the said Directive.
(2) Under Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC the Council, acting unanimously on proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce, or extend the period of validity of, special measures derogating from the provisions of the Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.
(3) As required under Article 27(3) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission, in a letter dated 11 October, informed the other Member States of the request of the German Government.
(4) The first derogating measure is intended completely to exclude the value added tax (VAT) which is charged on expenditure on goods and services from the right to deduct when over 90 % of the goods and services are used for the private purposes of the taxable person, or of his employees, or for non-business purposes in general. This measure represents a derogation from Article 17 and is justified by the need to simplify the procedure for charging the VAT.
(5) The second measure derogates from Article 17(2) and Article 6 of Directive 77/388/EEC and is intended to limit to 50 % a taxable person's right under Article 17(2) to deduct VAT in respect of all expenditure on vehichles not used solely for business purposes, and also not to charge the VAT due on passenger cars used for private purposes; this ceiling on a taxable person's right to deduct VAT is justified by the proven difficulty of actually verifying the breakdown between business and private expenditure on this type of good and by the consequent likelihood of tax evasion or abuse; in addition such measure will allow a more simplified system of taxation of the private use of vehicles.
(6) Nevertheless, the ceiling on a taxable person's right to deduct VAT may not be applied to expenditure on vehicles which represent a taxable person's current assets; furthermore, the flat-rate ceiling on the right to deduct may not be applied where a vehicle is used up to a maximum of 5 % for private purposes; in these cases the normal rules on deduction set out in Article 17(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC remain applicable.
(7) These provisions ensure that this degoration from the principle of a taxable person's right to deduct all the tax paid in connection with his taxable activities does not go beyond what is needed to counteract the risk of tax evasion or avoidance as defined in the Court's case-law(2) interpreting Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(8) On 17 June 1998, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EC as regards the right to deduct VAT(3); the purpose of the proposal is to harmonise definitively some of the disparate rules regarding ceilings on the right to deduct currently applied in the Member States as these could distort competition in international trade since such differences affect prices for goods and services.
(9) The authorisation to apply these derogating measures should therefore limit their period of validity so that this ends with the entry into force of the above proposed Directive, but not later than 31 December 2002 if that Directive is not yet in force by then; such a maximum period of validity would allow evaluation of whether the derogation is still appropriate in the light of progress in discussions in the Council or the proposed Directive at the time.
(10) The derogation would have no negative effect on the Communities' own resources provided from value added tax,","{'title': '2000/186/EC: Council Decision of 28 February 2000 authorising the Federal Republic of Germany to apply measures derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 17(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as amended by Article 28f of that Directive, the Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorised to exclude from the right to deduct the VAT charged on expenditure on goods and services where more than 90 % of those goods and services are used for the private purposes of a taxable person or of his employees or, more generally, for non-business purposes.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 17(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as amended by Article 28f of that Directive, and from Article 6(2)(a) of that Directive, the Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorised to limit to 50 % the right to deduct the VAT charged on expenditure on vehicles not used exclusively for business purposes and not to treat as supplies of services for consideration the use for private purposes of vehicles belonging to a taxable person's business.\n\nThe provisions of the first paragraph shall not apply where a vehicle represents a taxable person's current assets or, where such a vehicle is used up to a maximum of 5 % for private purposes.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall apply as from 1 April 1999.\n\nIt shall cease to be applicable on the date the Directive on expenditure not giving rise to the right to deduct VAT enters into force or shall expire on 31 December 2002 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 February 2000.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the EU Ecolabel (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
After consulting the European Union Eco-Labelling Board,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(6) of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010 the EU Ecolabel may not be awarded to goods containing substances or preparations/mixtures meeting the criteria for classification as toxic, hazardous to the environment, carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) or to goods containing substances referred to in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). In accordance with Article 6(7) of Regulation (EC) No 66/2010, for specific categories of goods containing those substances, where it is not technically feasible to substitute those goods as such or via the use of alternative materials or designs, or in the case of products which have a significantly higher overall environmental performance compared with other goods of the same category, the Commission may adopt measures to grant derogations from Article 6(6) of that Regulation.
(2) Commission Decisions 2011/263/EU (4), 2011/264/EU (5), 2011/382/EU (6), 2011/383/EU (7), 2012/720/EU (8) and 2012/721/EU (9) established the ecological criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents. Subsequent to the adoption of those Decisions, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 was amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 286/2011 (10). The amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 became applicable in respect of substances from 1 December 2012 and will become applicable in respect of mixtures from 1 June 2015. Regulation (EU) No 286/2011 added new classification criteria for long-term aquatic hazard based on chronic aquatic toxicity and biodegradability data. On the basis of the new criteria, the majority of readily-degradable surfactants currently used in detergents and cleaning products has become classified as Chronic category 3 (H412) and in some cases, specifically relevant to hand dishwashing detergents, as Chronic category 2 (H411), and therefore are banned from use in products bearing the EU Ecolabel. This would make it difficult for the established ecological criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents to correspond indicatively to the best 10-20 % of detergents and cleaning products available on the Union market in terms of environmental performance throughout their life-cycle, as there is no evidence that alternative surfactants are available. Assessment and verification text is updated, in order to provide guidance to help applicants to prove compliance with the new requirement.
(3) The consequences of introduction of new classification criteria were not known during the review of the criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners set out in Decisions 2011/263/EU, 2011/264/EU, 2011/382/EU and 2011/383/EU and during the development of criteria for the award of the EU Ecolabel for industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents and the considerations of derogations for surfactants set out in Decisions 2012/720/EU and 2012/721/EU.
(4) This amendment is applied retroactively from 1 December 2012, in order to ensure continuity of the validity of EU Ecolabel criteria for detergents for dishwashers, laundry detergents, hand dishwashing detergents, all-purpose cleaners and sanitary cleaners, industrial and institutional automatic dishwasher detergents and industrial and institutional laundry detergents.
(5) Decisions 2011/263/EU, 2011/264/EU, 2011/382/EU, 2011/383/EU, 2012/720/EU and 2012/721/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2267/2002 of 19 December 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 20 December 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition (2).
(2) DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt, hydroxy analogue of methionine, calcium salt of hydroxy analogue of methionine, isopropyl ester of methionine hydroxy analogue and DL-methionine technically pure protected with copolymer vinylpyridine/styrene were authorised without a time limit pursuant to Directive 82/471/EEC. These feed additives were subsequently entered in the European Union Register of feed additives as existing products, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt, hydroxy analogue of methionine and calcium salt of methionine hydroxy analogue as feed additives for all animal species and of isopropyl ester of methionine hydroxy analogue and DL-methionine technically pure protected with copolymer vinylpyridine/styrene as feed additives for dairy cows and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a change in the terms of the authorisation as regards the use of DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt and the hydroxy analogue of methionine via drinking water. In addition, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, the application contained the request for the authorisation of DL-methionine technically pure protected with ethylcellulose for ruminants. For all seven sources of methionine it was requested that those additives be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 6 March 2012 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt, hydroxy analogue of methionine, calcium salt of methionine hydroxy analogue, isopropyl ester of methionine hydroxy analogue, DL-methionine technically pure protected with copolymer vinylpyridine/styrene and DL-methionine technically pure protected with ethylcellulose do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that they are effective sources of methionine for protein synthesis in the respective target species. The Authority extrapolated this conclusion from dairy cows to all ruminants. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt, the hydroxy analogue of methionine, the calcium salt of methionine hydroxy analogue, the isopropyl ester of methionine hydroxy analogue, DL-methionine technically pure protected with copolymer vinylpyridine/styrene and DL-methionine technically pure protected with ethylcellulose shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.
(6) The Authority recommends that the use of methionine should not be authorised in water for drinking. However, this recommendation refers rather to the farm management as it concerns the way to achieve the optimal protein supply of the animal including the prevention of protein surpluses. No maximum content for the methionine sources is proposed by the Authority. Thus, it is in the case of administration of methionine sources via drinking water appropriate to instruct the user to consider all different methionine sources in order to achieve an optimal supply with the essential amino acids without affecting the performance of the animals.
(7) The Authority recommends further, to avoid the combined supplementation of feed with hydroxy analogue of methionine and cystine/cysteine. However, the settings of the animal trials on which this recommendation is based are not considered to be tangible to fully justify such a measure.
(8) Accordingly, the use of these substances should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of use for the already authorised sources of methionine, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.5.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 136/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 469/2013\nof 22 May 2013\nconcerning the authorisation of DL-methionine, DL-methionine sodium salt, hydroxy analogue of methionine, calcium salt of hydroxy analogue of methionine, isopropyl ester of hydroxy analogue of methionine, DL-methionine protected with copolymer vinylpyridine/styrene and DL-methionine protected with ethylcellulose as feed additives\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 32(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables (2) cross-refers to certain provisions of Articles 173 to 176 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3).
(2) Those provisions have however been deleted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 215/2006 of 8 February 2006 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code and amending Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003 (4).
(3) In the interests of legal certainty it is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 to make the necessary changes to ensure its continued smooth operation.
(4) The prices of fruit and vegetables change rapidly, and in line with the amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, potentially outdated unit prices should no longer be used in the framework of the entry price system.
(5) Since the modifications to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 applied from 19 May 2006, in the interest of legal certainty, those amendments should also apply as from that date.
(6) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 contains a list of representative markets. That list should be amended to include the representative markets in Bulgaria and Romania.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,","{'header': '30.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 172/41', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 756/2007\nof 29 June 2007\namending Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables(2)cross-refers to certain provisions of Articles 173 to 176 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(3).\n\n((2)) Those provisions have however been deleted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 215/2006 of 8 February 2006 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code and amending Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003(4).\n\n((3)) In the interests of legal certainty it is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 to make the necessary changes to ensure its continued smooth operation.\n\n((4)) The prices of fruit and vegetables change rapidly, and in line with the amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, potentially outdated unit prices should no longer be used in the framework of the entry price system.\n\n((5)) Since the modifications to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 applied from 19 May 2006, in the interest of legal certainty, those amendments should also apply as from that date.\n\n((6)) Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 contains a list of representative markets.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) According to recent scientific reports, and in particular the reports of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), highly sensitive deep-water habitats have been found and mapped in the Atlantic. Those habitats host important and highly diverse biological communities and are considered to require priority protection. In particular, they are defined as habitats of Community interest in Council Directive 92/43/EC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (2). Furthermore, deep-water coral reefs have recently been included in a list of endangered habitats in the framework of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).
(2) According to scientific evidence, recovery from damage to these habitats produced by trawl gear towed through the bottom is either impossible or very difficult and slow. The waters around the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira contains several known or potential deep-water habitats that have until recently been preserved from trawling. It is therefore appropriate to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gear in waters around the Azores, the Canary Islands and Madeira where these habitats are still in a favourable conservation status.
(3) New scientific information indicates that the catches of cod taken in fisheries carried out under the conditions specified in point 17 of Annex IV to Council Regulation (EC) No 2287/2003 of 19 December 2003 fixing for 2004 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (3) are likely to be low, and consequently these fisheries pose little additional risk to cod recovery. An increase in the number of days fishing for haddock is therefore justified.
(4) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important that the fisheries be available as soon as possible. Therefore, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period mentioned in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 24 January 2006
on the existence of an excessive deficit in the United Kingdom
(2006/125/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by the United Kingdom,
Whereas:
(1) Article 104 of the Treaty lays down an excessive deficit procedure (EDP) to ensure that Member States avoid excessive government deficits or that they correct such deficits when they occur.
(2) Pursuant to point 5 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the obligation under Article 104(1) of the Treaty to avoid excessive general government deficits does not apply to the United Kingdom unless it moves to the third stage of economic and monetary union. While in the second stage, the United Kingdom is required to endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits, pursuant to Article 116(4) of the Treaty.
(3) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(4) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1), which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provision of the said Protocol.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission services’ autumn 2005 forecast, as well as the United Kingdom’s December 2005 Pre-Budget Report, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in the United Kingdom. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of the United Kingdom on 11 January 2006.
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of the United Kingdom, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(7) In the period since the United Kingdom’s previous excessive deficit procedure was abrogated in May 1998, the UK general government balance moved from a comfortable surplus position in the late 1990s to a deficit of 3,2 % of GDP in 2003/04 (3). This development was equivalent to a change in the structural fiscal balance of around 4 percentage points of GDP in the period between 1999/2000 and 2003/04. During these years, the general government expenditure ratio increased from less than 40 % to about 43 % of GDP. In the same period, government gross fixed capital formation increased from 1,2 % to 1,6 % of GDP; the government gross debt ratio went down to 37,6 % of GDP in 2002/03 but has been increasing since then. Such an evolution, coupled with developments in interest rates, led to interest payments having fallen from 2,9 % to 2,0 % of GDP in that period.
(8) In the 2004/05 financial year, according to the EDP data notified by the United Kingdom in August 2005, the general government deficit remained at 3,2 % of GDP, again above, but close to, the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value. The excess over the 3 % of GDP reference value was not exceptional. In particular, it did not result from an unusual event outside the control of the United Kingdom authorities, nor was it the result of a severe economic downturn. Growth of 3,2 % in 2004 is estimated to have been above potential as was growth in the financial year 2004/05. The output gap in 2004 is estimated to have been positive, implying that the budget deficit was by and large structural. Therefore, the excess of the deficit over the reference value cannot be considered as resulting from a severe economic downturn. The excess over the 3 % of GDP reference value is also considered not temporary, based on the Commission services’ autumn 2005 forecasts. In 2004 to 2005, the general government gross fixed capital formation continued to increase, rising to 1,8 % of GDP, and in the United Kingdom Pre-Budget Report is set to reach 2,2 % in 2006/07 and 2,3 % in 2007/08. Assuming United Kingdom fiscal policy remained as hitherto announced, the deficit in these forecasts was expected to widen to just below 3,5 % of GDP in 2005/06 and to remain over 3 % of GDP in 2006/07. Based on these projections, the excess over the reference value could not be considered either exceptional or temporary within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact although the deficit is close to the reference value. After the Commission services’ autumn forecasts had been published, the United Kingdom announced policy decisions in the Pre-Budget Report presented to Parliament on 5 December. In net terms, the United Kingdom authorities’ costings of these measures, compared with the baseline of announced policy (as taken into account in the Commission services’ autumn forecasts), represent an easing of policy by 0,1 percentage points of GDP in the current financial year and a tightening of policy by 0,1 percentage points of GDP in 2006/07. Compared to an unchanged policy scenario, the Pre-Budget Report foresees a tightening of 0,2 percentage points of GDP in 2007/08 which is expected to be permanent. In the Pre-Budget Report, the UK authorities expect the deficit to be below 3 % in 2006/07 and to fall to 2,4 % in 2007/08. Taking into consideration these measures, which are all structural, the Commission’s assessment nevertheless remains that the deficit in 2006/07, at around 3,1 % of GDP, is expected to exceed 3 % of GDP and is therefore not temporary. This indicates that the Treaty requirement concerning the deficit criterion is not fulfilled.
(9) In contrast, the general government debt ratio remains well below the 60 % reference value (the August EDP data reporting a ratio of 40,8 % of GDP in the 2004/05 financial year) although, given the scale of actual and projected primary deficits, on a rising trend. In the Commission’s autumn forecasts the debt ratio is projected to reach around 44,5 % of GDP in 2007/08. This means that the Treaty requirement concerning the debt criterion is respected by a large margin.
(10) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. This double condition is not met in the case of the United Kingdom. Therefore, other relevant factors are not taken into account in this decision,","{'header': '22.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 51/14', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 24 January 2006\non the existence of an excessive deficit in the United Kingdom\n(2006/125/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 104 of the Treaty lays down an excessive deficit procedure (EDP) to ensure that Member States avoid excessive government deficits or that they correct such deficits when they occur.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to point 5 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the obligation under Article 104(1) of the Treaty to avoid excessive general government deficits does not apply to the United Kingdom unless it moves to the third stage of economic and monetary union.

Taking into consideration these measures, which are all structural, the Commission’s assessment nevertheless remains that the deficit in 2006/07, at around 3,1\xa0% of GDP, is expected to exceed 3\xa0% of GDP and is therefore not temporary. This indicates that the Treaty requirement concerning the deficit criterion is not fulfilled.\n\n((9)) In contrast, the general government debt ratio remains well below the 60\xa0% reference value (the August EDP data reporting a ratio of 40,8\xa0% of GDP in the 2004/05 financial year) although, given the scale of actual and projected primary deficits, on a rising trend. In the Commission’s autumn forecasts the debt ratio is projected to reach around 44,5\xa0% of GDP in 2007/08. This means that the Treaty requirement concerning the debt criterion is respected by a large margin.\n\n((10)) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. This double condition is not met in the case of the United Kingdom. Therefore, other relevant factors are not taken into account in this decision,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in the United Kingdom.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority concerned, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.
(2) A notification concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified oilseed rape product (Brassica napus L., GT73 line) was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of the Netherlands.
(3) The notification covers the same uses as for any other oilseed rape, with the exception of the uses as or in food and the cultivation in the Community of varieties derived from the genetically modified product (GT73 transformation event). The notification covers the importation and storage of the GT73 oilseed rape, and its use as feed as well as in the processing for feed, and its industrial uses as or in products.
(4) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of the Netherlands prepared an assessment report, which is submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of other Member States. That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of GT73 oilseed rape should be withheld.
(5) The competent authorities of certain Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.
(6) The opinion adopted on 11 February 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority, as established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (2), concluded, from all evidence provided, that Brassica napus L. line GT73 is as safe as conventional oilseed rape for humans and animals, and in the context of the proposed uses, for the environment. The European Food Safety Authority also found that the monitoring plan provided by the consent holder was appropriate for the intended uses of the GT73 oilseed rape.
(7) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of Brassica napus L. line GT73 will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.
(8) Refined oil from GT73 oilseed rape has been commercially released for food purposes in the Community in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (3).
(9) A unique identifier should be assigned to the GT73 oilseed rape for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(10) Adventitious or technically unavoidable traces of genetically modified organisms in products are exempted from labelling and traceability requirements in accordance with thresholds established under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (5).
(11) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.
(12) In the light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, an appropriate management system should be in place to prevent grains of GT73 oilseed rape entering cultivation.
(13) Prior to the placing on the market of the product, the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market, including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should be applicable.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6) the measures should be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '24.6.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 164/57', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 June 2005\nconcerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of an oilseed rape product (Brassica napusL., GT73 line) genetically modified for tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate\n(notified under document number C(2005) 1838)\n(Only the Dutch text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/465/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority concerned, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.\n\n((2)) A notification concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified oilseed rape product (Brassica napusL., GT73 line) was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of the Netherlands.\n\n((3)) The notification covers the same uses as for any other oilseed rape, with the exception of the uses as or in food and the cultivation in the Community of varieties derived from the genetically modified product (GT73 transformation event).

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) In August 1999, by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of steel ropes and cables (the product concerned) originating, inter alia, in India.
(2) In November 2005, following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1858/2005 (3) decided that the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of the product concerned originating, inter alia, in India should be maintained.
(3) By Decision 1999/572/EC (4), the Commission accepted a price undertaking from an Indian company, Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd. This company has changed its name in the meantime and is now known as Usha Martin Ltd (UML). The change of name has in no way affected the activities of the company.
(4) As a result, imports into the Community of the product concerned of Indian origin, produced by UML or by any other related company worldwide, and of a type covered by the undertaking (the product covered by the undertaking), were exempt from the definitive anti-dumping duties.
(5) In this regard, it should be noted that certain types of steel wire rope currently produced by UML were not exported to the Community during the investigation period which led to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping measures and were not, therefore, within the scope of the exemption afforded by the undertaking. Accordingly, such steel-wire ropes were liable to payment of the anti-dumping duty when they entered into free circulation in the Community.
B.   FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING
(6) The undertaking offered by UML obliges it (and any related company worldwide) to, inter alia, export the product covered by the undertaking to the first independent customer in the Community at or above certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) laid down in the undertaking. These price levels eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. In the case of resale in the Community to the first independent customer by related importers, the resale prices of the product covered by the undertaking, after appropriate adjustments for selling, general and administrative costs and a reasonable profit, must also be at levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
(7) The terms of the undertaking also oblige UML to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a quarterly report of its sales (and resale by its related parties in the Community) of the product concerned originating in India to the Community. Such reports are intended to include the products covered by the undertaking which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duty as well as those types of steel-wire ropes not covered by the undertaking and which are therefore liable to the anti-dumping duty.
(8) Unless otherwise indicated, it is assumed by the Commission that the sales reports of UML (and the reports of resale of related companies established in the Community) are, as submitted, complete, exhaustive and correct in all particulars.
(9) It was also acknowledged by UML that, with regard to the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertaking, such exemption is conditional upon presentation to Community customs services of an ‘undertaking invoice’. Moreover, the company undertook not to issue such undertaking invoices for the sale of those types of products concerned, not covered by the undertaking and which are therefore liable to the anti-dumping duty.
(10) It is also a condition of the undertaking that the terms and provisions thereof apply to any related company to UML, worldwide.
(11) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the undertaking, UML also agreed to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission and to allow on-the-spot verification visits at its premises, and those of any related companies, in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports.
(12) In this regard, verification visits were carried out at the premises of UML in India and at those of a related company to UML in Dubai, i.e. Brunton Wolf Wire Ropes FZE (BWWR).
(13) The verification visit to the Indian company showed that significant volumes of the product concerned, not covered by the undertaking, had been omitted from the quarterly undertaking sales reports submitted to the Commission. Furthermore, the goods in question had been sold by UML to its related importers in the United Kingdom and Denmark and included on undertaking invoices.
(14) The verification visit to the Dubai company showed that certain steel-wire ropes had been exported to the Community from Dubai and declared at import into the Community as having United Arab Emirates origin when in fact they were of Indian origin and therefore liable to the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of steel-wire ropes originating in India. The goods in question had not been reported on the quarterly undertaking sales report nor, as was admitted by the company, had anti-dumping duty been paid on them. The goods had also been resold to the first independent customer in the Community at prices below the MIPs.
(15) Commission Decision 2006/38/EC (5), sets out in more detail the nature of the breaches found.
(16) In view of these breaches, acceptance of the undertaking offered by Usha Martin Industries and Usha Beltron Ltd, now known as Usha Martin Ltd (TARIC additional code A024) has been withdrawn by Decision 2006/38/EC. A definitive anti-dumping duty should therefore be imposed forthwith on imports of the product concerned exported to the Community by the company concerned.
(17) In accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation, the rate of the anti-dumping duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. As the investigation in question was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and resulting injury by Regulation (EC) No 1796/1999, it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping rate should be set at the level and in the form imposed by that Regulation, namely 23,8 % of the net, cif free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty.
C.   AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1858/2005

It should therefore be possible to set a different refund for potato starch.
(2) Applications for refund certificates can be lodged each working day before 3 p.m. Brussels time. As this time limit may fall after commencement of a meeting of the Management Committee for Cereals at which refund rates are being decided there is a risk of speculative applications. The time limit should therefore be brought forward.
(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 stipulates that production refund certificates are valid until the last day of the fifth month following that of issue. This carries a risk that certificates will be issued for over-large volumes; since the Commission can neither reject certificate applications in the event of speculation nor set a different refund rate without consulting the Management Committee for Cereals, the validity of licences should be shortened to end on the last day of the third month following that of issue.
(4) The Commission does not have detailed information on the quantities on which production refunds have been granted until three months after the end of each quarter of the calendar year. To make a better picture of the situation Member States should notify monthly the quantities of starch for which certificate applications have been made.
(5) Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 should be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Articles 30 and 75 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Articles 30 and 75 of the Act of Accession, the duties applicable on the import into the Community, as constituted on 31 December 1985, of the following quality wines from Spain shall be progressively abolished within the limits of Community tariff quotas:
- 358 120 hectolitres quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez in containers holding 2 litres or less, falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 41 and ex 2204 21 51,
- 435 000 hectolitres quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez in containers holding more than 2 litres falling within CN codes ex 2204 29 41 and ex 2204 29 51,
- 15 000 hectolitres quality wines produced in the specified region of Málaga in containers holding 2 litres or less, falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 49 and ex 2204 21 59, and
- 22 008 hectolitres quality wines produced in the specified regions of Jumilla, Priorato, Rioja and Valdepeñas, in containers holding 2 litres or less, falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 21, ex 2204 21 23, ex 2204 21 31, ex 2204 21 33 and ex 2204 21 49;
Whereas, however, with regard to the quality wines produced in the specified region of Jerez, in order to fultil better the requirements of the common market, a single overall tariff quota of 793 120 hectolitres should be opened;
Whereas these duties are reduced to 50 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1989 and to 37,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1990; whereas, by way of derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Regulation (EEC) No 4161/87 (1) lays down consequent on the entry into force of the combined nomenclature, the basic duties to be adopted within the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal;
Whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the imports of these wines Community tariff quotas should be opened for the period from 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 for the abovementioned wines at duties as shown in the list in Article 1;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade in agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question coming from Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quotas are only applicable in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas in this case they should not be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to a procedure to be determined; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used and inform the Member States accordingly;

of 1 February 1990
terminating the proceeding under Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 concerning plain paper photocopiers assembled or produced in the Community by Ricoh Industrie France SA
(90/47/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 13 (10) thereof.
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under Regulation, (EEC) No 2423/88
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In January 1988, the Commission received a complaint lodged by CECOM, the Committee of European Copier Manufacturers, on behalf of producers of plain paper photocopiers (PPCs) whose collective output constitutes a major proportion of Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained sufficient evidence of the fact that, following the opening of the investigation concerning PPCs originating in Japan (2) which led to the adoption of Council Regulation (EEC) No 535/87 (3) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of those products, a number of companies were assembling PPCs in the Community under the conditions referred to in Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
(2) On 17 February 1988 the Commission announced (4) that it had commenced an investigation in respect of PPCs assembled in the Community by Canon Inc., Konishoroku Photo Industry Co., Matsushita Electric Co. Ltd, Minolta Camera Co. Ltd, Ricoh Company Ltd, Sharp Corporation and Toshiba Corporation. By Council Regulation (EEC) No 3205/88 (5) and Commission Decision 88/519/EEC (6), the findings of the investigation were made known.
Subsequent to this investigation, the Commission established that Ricoh Company Ltd had begun production or assembly of the product concerned at its wholly-owned subsidiary in France, Ricoh Industrie France SA.
On the basis of these facts, the Commission considered it appropriate that it should investigate the assembly of PPCs in the Community by Ricoh Industrie France SA.
Accordingly, after consultation, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (7), the initiation of the investigation under the said Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 concerning PPCs assembled or produced in the Community by Ricoh Industrie France SA.
(3) The Commission so informed the company concerned, the representatives of Japan and the complainants and gave the interested parties the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(4) The Company concerned made its views known in writing. The same Company and the complainants requested and were granted hearings by the Commission.
(5) No submissions were made by purchasers of PPCs assembled in the Community by Ricoh Industrie France SA. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the assessment of the nature of the alleged assembly operations and carried out investigations at the premises of Ricoh Industrie France SA.
(6) The period of investigation was from 1 November 1988 to 30 April 1989.
B. RELATIONSHIP OR ASSOCIATION WITH EXPORTER
(7) Ricoh Industrie SA was found to be related to or associated with Ricoh Company Ltd whose exports of PPCs were subject to the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 535/87. In fact it was found to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese company mentioned above.
C. PRODUCTION
(8) The Commission established that the assembly or production operations carried out by Ricoh Industrie France SA had started after the opening of the anti-dumping investigation on PPCs.
D. PARTS
(9) The parts were identified according to the provisions of Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. In this context and in line with previous practice, the Commission deemed it appropriate to consider the types of printed circuit board examined during the investigation as single parts, given the nature of their structure.
(10) As in previous cases, the value of the parts in question were generally determined on the basis of the company's purchase prices of these parts when delivered to the factories in the Community. The relevant value is that of the parts and materials as they are used in the assembly operations, i.e. on an into-factory basis.
(11) The origin of the parts was taken into account according to the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 802/68 (1) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1769/89 (2).
(12) The weighted average value of Japanese parts or materials for all models assembled or produced by Ricoh France Industrie SA was found not to have exceeded by at least 50 % the value of all other parts or materials used.
Accordingly the anti-dumping duty cannot be extended to the PPCs assembled or produced by the abovementioned company.
E. CONCLUSION
(13) In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that the investigation under Article 13 (10) of (EEC) Regulation 2423/88 should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping duties on PPCs assembled or produced by Ricoh Industrie France SA.",{'title': '90/47/EEC: Commission Decision of 1 February 1990 terminating the proceeding under Article 13 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 concerning plain paper photocopiers assembled or produced in the Community by Ricoh Industrie France SA'}

Whereas:
(1) Directive 89/556/EEC sets out the animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species.

(3) The model animal health certificate for intra-Community trade in embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species is laid down in Annex C to Directive 89/556/EEC. That certificate does not contain any specific requirements concerning semen used for fertilisation.

Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 5 May 2000, an anti-dumping proceeding(2) was initiated by the Commission on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables (""the product concerned"") originating, inter alia, in Turkey.
(2) This proceeding resulted in an anti-dumping duty being imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001(3) in August 2001 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
(3) Provisional measures were imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 230/2001(4). In parallel, the Commission accepted, inter alia, a price undertaking from the Turkish exporting producer Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS by Article 2(1). Imports of products produced and directly exported by that company were exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Article 2(2).
B. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF THE JOINT UNDERTAKING
(4) Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS advised the Commission that they wished to withdraw this undertaking. Accordingly, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2303/2002(5), the name of this company has been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 230/2001.
C. AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1601/2001
(5) In view of the above and pursuant to Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 should be amended accordingly, and goods manufactured by Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS should be subject to the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty for that company as set in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 (31,0 %),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2288/2002 of 19 December 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 imposing a definitive anti–dumping duty and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand and Turkey', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe table in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 is replaced by the following table:\n\n"">TABLE>""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nL.

of 6 April 2004
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.
(5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 635/2000, lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.
(7) By Regulations (EC) No 1039/2003(4), (EC) No 1086/2003(5), (EC) No 1087/2003(6), (EC) No 1088/2003(7), (EC) No 1089/2003(8) and (EC) No 1090/2003(9) the Council adopted autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to those countries.. Those Regulations provide that with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic, shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(8) Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(10), provides that with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in Article 1(2) thereof, which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(9) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(11), provides that with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(10) With a view to enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004, and in order to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the acceding states on the Community level and to prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of products in receipt of export refunds, the setting of all remaining export refunds has been discontinued in the milk and milk products sector, in relation to the products concerned when exported unprocessed to the acceding states.
(11) Therefore, with effect from 7 April 2004 no refund should be set for certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Cyprus and Poland and for the goods which are not referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 when exported to Hungary.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996 laying down a Community procedure for flavouring substances used or intended for use in or on foodstuffs(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003(2), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 lays down the procedure for the establishment of rules in respect of flavouring substances used or intended to be used in foodstuffs. That Regulation provides for the adoption of a register of flavouring substances (""the register"") following notification by the Member States of a list of the flavouring substances which may be used in or on foodstuffs marketed in their territory and on the basis of scrutiny by the Commission of that notification.
(2) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 provides for a programme of evaluation of the flavouring substances contained in the register (""the evaluation programme"") in order to check if those substances comply within the general criteria for their use set out in the Annex to that Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 provides that the persons responsible for placing the flavouring substances on the market are to forward data necessary for their evaluation to the Commission. That Regulation also provides that following completion of the evaluation programme, the list of flavouring substances the use of which is to be authorised to the exclusion of others, is to be adopted.
(3) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96, Commission Decision 1999/217/EC of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996(3), as last amended by Decision 2002/113/EC(4), adopted a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000 of 18 July 2000 laying down the measures necessary for the adoption of an evaluation programme in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), provides for certain information to be submitted by the person responsible for placing certain flavouring substances contained in the register on the market in order to enable the evaluation of the substance to be carried out.
(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 622/2002 of 11 April 2002 establishing deadlines for the submission of information for the evaluation of chemically defined flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs(6), established time limits for the submission of information for the evaluation of flavouring substances as required pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1565/2000. However, for a number of substances for which the deadline of 31 December 2002 had been established, no information has been submitted nor has the Commission been informed about any intention to still submit information. Therefore, these substances cannot be evaluated in respect of their compliance with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 before the completion of the evaluation programme. Accordingly, it is appropriate to delete these substances from the register.
(6) Scrutiny of the flavouring substances listed in the register revealed inconsistencies concerning the names of certain substances (FL No 06.100, and FL No 06.131) and also concerning certain chemical numbers (FL No 02.027, FL No 07.033, FL No 07.153, and FL No 09.578). In addition, cases were identified where the same substance appeared under different chemical names in the register (FL No 02.228 and FL No 02.027; FL No 07.221 and FL No 07.033). Those inconsistencies should be rectified.
(7) Scrutiny by the Commission also revealed that of the different forms of quinine only quinine hydrochloride (FL No 14.011), quinine monohydrochloride dihydrate (FL No 14.155) and quinine sulphate (FL No 14.152) are used as flavouring substances. The other forms of quinine (FL No 14.146 and FL No 14.154) should therefore be deleted from the register.
(8) The Scientific Committee on Food concluded in its opinion of 26 February 2002 that N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-8-methylnon-6-enamide (capsaicin, FL No 16.014) is genotoxic. Capsaicin is naturally present in Capsicum species (e.g. chilli, cayenne pepper, red pepper). High consumption of chillies has been reported to be a risk factor for cancer. Although the maximum daily intake in the European Union is much lower than the intake levels associated with cancer, the addition of capsaicin as such to food should be avoided, as it does not comply with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96. Accordingly, that substance should be deleted from the register.
(9) For two substances listed in the register (CN060 and CN061), the notifying Member State has withdrawn its notification. Those substances should therefore be deleted from the register.
(10) It is not appropriate to maintain the confidential code of substances that otherwise have been notified with their full name and were on the market at the moment the register was elaborated.
(11) The industry has now provided information concerning certain substances which are indicated with the number 4 in the column ""comments"" of part A of the Annex to Decision 1999/217/EC and for which additional information was required under that Decision. In particular, evidence was provided that those substances are flavouring substances. Accordingly, that Annex should be amended to delete the reference to number 4.
(12) It is appropriate to make a correction to the register by giving a Flavis number to some substances that were on the market at the moment the register was elaborated to ensure that they are correctly taken up in the evaluation programme.
(13) Member States have notified new flavouring substances to be included in the evaluation programme and they should therefore be incorporated into the register.
(14) For some newly notified substances, in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 and Commission Recommendation 98/282/EC of 21 April 1998 on the ways in which the Member States and signatory States to the Agreement on the European Economic Area should protect intellectual property in connection with the development and manufacture of flavouring substances referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7), the notifying Member State requested designation in such a way as to protect the intellectual property rights of their manufacturer. Those substances should therefore be listed in part B of the Annex to Decision 1999/217/EC.
(15) Decision 1999/217/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': '2004/357/EC: Commission Decision of 7 April 2004 amending Decision 1999/217/EC as regards the register of flavouring substances (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2004) 1273)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Decision 1999/217/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 April 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 299, 23.11.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 84, 27.3.1999, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 49, 20.2.2002, p. 1.\n\n(5) OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 8.\n\n(6) OJ L 95, 12.4.2002, p. 10.\n\n(7) OJ L 127, 29.4.1998, p. 32.\n\nANNEX\n\nThe Annex to Decision 1999/217/EC is amended as follows:\n\n1. in the list in the third paragraph of the introductory part of the Annex which precedes part A, the following point 6 is added:\n\n""6.

After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 29 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9  (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns authorisation of the preparation benzoic acid (VevoVitall) as a feed additive for weaned piglets, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 9 December 2005 that benzoic acid (VevoVitall) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (2). It further concluded that benzoic acid (VevoVitall) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation improves the performance parameters, such as weight gain or feed gain ratio, in piglets. The opinion of the Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.

(88/503/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas, in order to meet the needs of the common agricultural policy, action is needed to identify and measure as accurately and rapidly as possible the areas under main crops, and in particular those for which production aid is granted on an area basis;
Whereas, for the management of the agricultural markets, reliable regionally-based estimates of production must be available in good time;
Whereas the availability of forecasts for the production of crops which have the greatest impact on world markets, in third countries, is also relevant to the management of agricultural markets and for the independence of Community decision-making;
Whereas remote sensing could be likely to offer a response to these needs, which have not been met to date by the existing agricultural statistics and forecasting systems; whereas it could enhance the accuracy, objectivity, speed and frequency with which observations are made when statistical data are collected; whereas it could help perfect agricultural forecasting models, and in particular establish regionally-based agricultural forecasting models;
Whereas remote sensing must be incorporated into the existing statistical systems to make good sepcific deficiencies or weaknesses and to replace to better advantage certain aspects of the work currently being carried out;
Whereas remote sensing could have applications - in its own right or as an adjunct - in the establishment and collection of agricultural statistics;
Whereas a consultation procedure setting up close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission on the basis of past and present experience gained by the Member States in incorporating remote sensing in existing statistical systems, in particular through the medium of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics set up by Decision 72/279/EEC (2);
Whereas remote sensing could help align the Member States' various agricultural statistical systems, by establishing a common means of collecting and transmitting information;
Whereas remote sensing could enable savings to be planned in the future, either directly in the cost of drawing up sampling plans and of collecting statistical data, or indirectly in expenditure of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF);
Whereas steps should be taken to develop the operational applications of remote sensing to agricultural statistics in the short, medium and long term, and to continue the measures embarked upon;
Whereas these operational applications of remote sensing to agricultural statistics must be conducted in a manner which is compatible with the programme adopted by Decision 85/318/EEC (1) on the establishment of an information system on the state of the environment and natural resources in the Community,","{'title': '88/503/EEC: Council Decision of 26 September 1988 adopting a pilot project on remote sensing applied to agricultural statistics', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

The second is to estimate production in time for making decisions. Only when such basis statistics are available, can forecasting be considered.\n\nThe results of this plan should fit into a framework which can be called an 'Advanced Agriculture information System'. In the pilot projects, emphasis will be placed upon remote sensing, but in operational use, this technique is seen as complementary to more conventional data. The semi-operational projects within the pilot project will test this kind of complementarity.\n\nWhile the development effort is planned to be extended over 10 years, this Decision considers in some detail only the first five years. During this period, the pilot project should already lead to an integration of new methods in the Community agricultural information system. Cereals and oil seeds, which are generally grown on flat terrain and large fields, will be considered first. When feasible, vineyards and olive trees will also be dealt with because of their economic importance.\n\nTaking into account priorities, methodologies to be developed and the requirements of satellite data, the plan has been organized in seven actions (Table 1). Actions 1 to 5 each correspond to a given operational objective Action 6 is support (ground surveys) necessary for all the actions. Action 7 consists of several long term studies, not connected with one particular operational objective.\n\nFor each action, specific methodology will be developed and development work will be undertaken in support of the semi-operational objective (Actions 1, 2, 4 and 5) or as the very core of the action (Actions 3 and 7): see Table 2.\n\nIn respect to the shift towards operational applications, the actions concern three different time schedules:\n\n- short-term (three to five years): Actions 1, 2 and 4,\n\n- medium-term (five to ten years): Actions 3 and 5\n\n- long-term (more than ten years): Action 7.\n\nThe costs of the project are summarized, for the next five years, in Table 3.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nOutline of the pilot project\n\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Action  // Main orientation  // Geographic localization  // Input  // Output  //  //  //  //  //  // 1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the third and fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, except where a decision has been taken not to include the substance concerned in Annex I.
(2) Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3600/92 (2) and (EC) No 451/2000 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first and second stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of the above directive. This programme is ongoing and it has not been possible yet to complete decision making on a number of active substances.
(3) As regards the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the above programme of work, 67 have been the subject of a directive or a decision. This leaves 23 active substances for which work continues. As regards the 53 active substances covered by the second stage of the above programme of work, one has been the subject of a decision. This leaves 52 active substances for which work continues. For the first stage of the work programme, the Commission organised the peer review, after submission of the draft assessment report by the Rapporteur Member State. This cycle of peer reviews has been finalised meanwhile and decisions or directives on the last substances are currently under preparation. For the second stage, the peer review comes under the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which has one year from the submission of the draft assessment report, to communicate its opinion to the Commission. As the dates of submission being part of the arrangements agreed between the Commission and EFSA, it is possible to predict when the latest opinion will become ready. To date, three have been delivered to the Commission, while the last should be made available to the Commission at the end of 2005. Consequently, more time should be allocated to the assessment of the second stage substances than to those covered by the first stage which already have passed this part of the process.
(4) The Commission’s progress report of 26 July 2001 (4) explained why progress has not been as good as was originally anticipated. The main reasons for the delay were a slow start, due to the identification and priority classification of the substances, the need to bring together the necessary resources and to provide more elaborated procedural schemes for evaluation and decision-making. Based on the conclusions of this report the deadline was extended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 (5) for those substances still under review. Meanwhile, the Commission and Member States have worked actively to improve the procedures for assessing active substances, and the considerable increase rate of decisions over the last years show that the learning cycle can be considered closed. EFSA, which bears responsibility in the second stage of the review programme, is also entering an operational phase, and its first opinions have now been delivered. However, some of the reasons identified in the report of 2001 still apply. These include the further need to make the best use of the limited resources by appropriate methods of work-sharing and to ensure that the currently reached number of yearly decisions is maintained. The initial slowness, the technical complexity of certain dossiers, the necessity to obtain the opinion of independent scientific circles and other unforeseen factors, have eroded, in a number of cases, the time necessary for the decision-making and the implementing measures.
(5) It is envisaged that all the substances covered by the first and second stage of the above review programme should be the subject of a specific act adopted before 31 December 2005 (for the first stage) or 30 September 2006 (for the second stage). However, time must be allowed for these acts to come into force, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.
(6) For these reasons it is appropriate to extend the transitional period for the first stage by one year and for the second stage by twenty one months.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 and Commission Decisions 2002/928/EC of 26 November 2002 concerning the non-inclusion of benomyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance (6), 2004/129/EC of 30 January 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (7), 2004/140/EC of 11 February 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of fenthion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance (8), 2004/247/EC of 10 March 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of simazine in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance (9) and 2005/303/EC of 31 March 2005 concerning the non-inclusion of cresylic acid, dichlorophen, imazamethabenz, kasugamycin and polyoxin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (10) contain provisions for the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and for the withdrawal by Member States of all authorisations for plant protection products containing those substances. Those acts provide for derogations permitting the continued use of some of those substances for a limited period of time while alternatives are being developed.
(8) Member States have presented new evidence demonstrating the need for further essential uses. Such information has been evaluated by the Commission with Member State experts.

This programme is ongoing and it has not been possible yet to complete decision making on a number of active substances.\n\n((3)) As regards the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the above programme of work, 67 have been the subject of a directive or a decision. This leaves 23 active substances for which work continues. As regards the 53 active substances covered by the second stage of the above programme of work, one has been the subject of a decision. This leaves 52 active substances for which work continues. For the first stage of the work programme, the Commission organised the peer review, after submission of the draft assessment report by the Rapporteur Member State. This cycle of peer reviews has been finalised meanwhile and decisions or directives on the last substances are currently under preparation. For the second stage, the peer review comes under the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which has one year from the submission of the draft assessment report, to communicate its opinion to the Commission. As the dates of submission being part of the arrangements agreed between the Commission and EFSA, it is possible to predict when the latest opinion will become ready. To date, three have been delivered to the Commission, while the last should be made available to the Commission at the end of 2005. Consequently, more time should be allocated to the assessment of the second stage substances than to those covered by the first stage which already have passed this part of the process.\n\n((4)) The Commission’s progress report of 26 July 2001(4)explained why progress has not been as good as was originally anticipated. The main reasons for the delay were a slow start, due to the identification and priority classification of the substances, the need to bring together the necessary resources and to provide more elaborated procedural schemes for evaluation and decision-making. Based on the conclusions of this report the deadline was extended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002(5)for those substances still under review. Meanwhile, the Commission and Member States have worked actively to improve the procedures for assessing active substances, and the considerable increase rate of decisions over the last years show that the learning cycle can be considered closed. EFSA, which bears responsibility in the second stage of the review programme, is also entering an operational phase, and its first opinions have now been delivered. However, some of the reasons identified in the report of 2001 still apply. These include the further need to make the best use of the limited resources by appropriate methods of work-sharing and to ensure that the currently reached number of yearly decisions is maintained. The initial slowness, the technical complexity of certain dossiers, the necessity to obtain the opinion of independent scientific circles and other unforeseen factors, have eroded, in a number of cases, the time necessary for the decision-making and the implementing measures.\n\n((5)) It is envisaged that all the substances covered by the first and second stage of the above review programme should be the subject of a specific act adopted before 31 December 2005 (for the first stage) or 30 September 2006 (for the second stage). However, time must be allowed for these acts to come into force, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.\n\n((6)) For these reasons it is appropriate to extend the transitional period for the first stage by one year and for the second stage by twenty one months.\n\n((7)) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 and Commission Decisions 2002/928/EC of 26 November 2002 concerning the non-inclusion of benomyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance(6), 2004/129/EC of 30 January 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances(7), 2004/140/EC of 11 February 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of fenthion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance(8), 2004/247/EC of 10 March 2004 concerning the non-inclusion of simazine in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance(9)and 2005/303/EC of 31 March 2005 concerning the non-inclusion of cresylic acid, dichlorophen, imazamethabenz, kasugamycin and polyoxin in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances(10)contain provisions for the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and for the withdrawal by Member States of all authorisations for plant protection products containing those substances. Those acts provide for derogations permitting the continued use of some of those substances for a limited period of time while alternatives are being developed.\n\n((8)) Member States have presented new evidence demonstrating the need for further essential uses. Such information has been evaluated by the Commission with Member State experts.\n\n((9)) Derogations should only be granted for cases which appear justified and which do not give rise to concern and should be restricted to the control of harmful organisms for which no efficient alternatives exist.\n\n((10)) Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 and Decisions 2002/928/EC, 2004/129/EC, 2004/140/EC, 2004/247/EC and 2005/303/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 2076/2002 is amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘The time period of 12 years referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC is extended until 31 December 2006 for the active substances which are assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, until 30 September 2007 for the active substances which are assessed in the framework of the second stage under Regulation (EC) No 451/2000, and until 31 December 2008 for the active substances which are assessed in the framework of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002, unless a decision has been taken or is taken before the relevant date to include or not include the active substance concerned in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes dinocap.
(2) For dinocap, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the Rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/95 of 3 March 1995 (4), Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State. Austria submitted the relevant assessment report and recommendations to the Commission on 18 May 2000 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(3) The assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
(4) As regards dinocap, two questions were submitted to the Scientific Panel on Plant Health, Plant Protection Products and their Residues of the European Food Safety Authority (the Scientific Panel). The first question concerned the relevance to humans of eye effects that have been observed in dogs and the second related to the appropriate value for dermal absorption that could be derived from the different studies that have been made available by the notifier. On the first question the Scientific Panel considered that there is not sufficient information to conclude that the eye effects in dogs would only be specific to that species and that more research on the mechanisms involved may be necessary. Consequently, it is concluded that these effects in dogs cannot be regarded to be irrelevant to humans. On the second question, the Scientific Panel (5) considered a value of 10 % dermal absorption to be appropriate for the purpose of the assessment. In both cases, the recommendations of the Scientific Panel have been taken into consideration in formulating this Directive and the relevant review report.
(5) Articles 5(4) and 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provide that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to restrictions and conditions. In this case, restrictions on the inclusion period and on the authorised crops are deemed necessary. The original measures presented to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, proposed the restriction of the inclusion period to seven years, so that Member States would give priority to reviewing plant protection products already on the market containing dinocap. In order to avoid discrepancies in the high level of protection sought, the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC was intended to be limited to the uses of dinocap that have been actually assessed within the Community evaluation and for which the proposed uses were considered to comply with the conditions of Directive 91/414/EEC. This implies that other uses, which were not or only partially covered by this assessment, had first to be subject to a complete assessment, before their inclusion in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC could be considered. Finally, due to the hazardous nature of dinocap, it was considered necessary to provide for a minimum harmonisation at Community level of certain risk mitigation measures that were to be applied by Member States when granting authorisations.
(6) Under the procedures laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, the approval of active substances, including the definition of risk management measures, is decided by the Commission. Member States bear the responsibility for the implementation, application and control of the measures intended to mitigate the risks generated by plant protection products. Concerns expressed by several Member States reflect their judgment that additional restrictions are necessary to reduce the risk to a level that can be considered acceptable and consistent with the high level of protection that is sought within the Community. At present, it is a question of risk management to set the adequate level of safety and protection for the continued production, commercialisation and use of dinocap.
(7) As a consequence of the above, the Commission re-examined its position. In order to correctly reflect the high level of protection of human and animal health and a sustainable environment sought in the Community, it considered appropriate, in addition to the principles set out in recital 5, to further reduce the period of inclusion to three instead of seven years. This further reduces any risk by ensuring the need for a priority reassessment of this substance.
(8) It may be expected that plant protection products containing dinocap satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report and providing that the necessary risk mitigation measures are applied.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that plant protection products containing dinocap may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Member States should require authorisation holders to provide information on the use of dinocap including any information on incidences on operator health.
(10) As with all substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the status of dinocap could be reviewed pursuant to Article 5(5) of that Directive in the light of any new data becoming available. Equally, the fact that the inclusion of this substance in Annex I expires on a particular date does not prevent the inclusion being renewed according to the procedures laid down in the Directive.
(11) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(12) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(13) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing dinocap to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations. in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. Given the hazardous properties of dinocap, the period for Member States to verify whether the plant protection products, which contain dinocap as the only active substances or in combination with other authorised active substances, comply with the provisions of Annex VI should not exceed three years.
(14) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(15) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. On the expiry of the period laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 19(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the Council had neither adopted the proposed implementing act nor indicated its opposition to the proposal for implementing measures and it is accordingly for the Commission to adopt these measures,","{'header': '12.12.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 349/42', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/136/EC\nof 11 December 2006\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include dinocap as active substance\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n\n((12)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n\n((13)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing dinocap to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations. in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. Given the hazardous properties of dinocap, the period for Member States to verify whether the plant protection products, which contain dinocap as the only active substances or in combination with other authorised active substances, comply with the provisions of Annex VI should not exceed three years.\n\n((14)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n\n((15)) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. On the expiry of the period laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 19(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the Council had neither adopted the proposed implementing act nor indicated its opposition to the proposal for implementing measures and it is accordingly for the Commission to adopt these measures,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall adopt and publish by 30 June 2007 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Whereas in order to keep the aid system within acceptable financial limits, provision has been made  in Regulation (EEC) N° 729/89 (3) for an overall amount of ECU 220 million, determined, on the one  hand, on the basis of the total sum of the co-responsibility levies payable by producers marketing  no more than 25 tonnes and, on the other hand, on the basis of a basic co-responsibility levy and  an additional co-responsibility levy, each of which is equal to 3 % of the intervention price for  common wheat;
Whereas the additional co-responsibility levy is fixed, as from the 1990/91 marketing year, on the  basis of a flat rate of 1,5 %, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of the degree by which  the maximum guaranteed amount was exceeded in the preceding marketing year; whereas fixing that  levy may result in a different estimated total amount; whereas account should be taken thereof;
Whereas the introduction of the system of aid to small producers of arable holdings represents an  alternative for the Member States to the current special arrangements applicable to small cereal  producers; whereas the Member States which apply the new arrangements should not be eligible for  their share in the overall amount of ECU 220 million,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1347/90 of 14 May 1990 amending Regulation (EEC) No 729/89 laying down general rules for the special arrangements applicable to small producers as part of the co-responsibility arrangements in the cereals sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) N° 729/89 shall be replaced  by the following:', 'text': ""Article 2 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) N° 729/89 shall be replaced  by the following:\n\n'3.

amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, to the decommitment rules for certain Member States, and to the rules on payments of the final balance
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) The unprecedented enduring global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in the Member States. In particular, certain Member States are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, in particular with problems in their economic growth and financial stability and with a deterioration in their deficit and debt position, also as a result of the international economic and financial environment.
(2) Whilst important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the financial crisis have already been taken, including amendments of the legislative framework, the impact of that crisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens is being widely felt. Pressure on national financial resources is increasing and further steps should be taken urgently to alleviate that pressure through the maximal and optimal use of the funding from the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund (‘the Funds’). In view of the persistence of the financial difficulties, it is necessary to extend the application of the measures adopted by Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). Those measures were adopted pursuant to Article 122(2) and Articles 136 and 143 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
(3) In order to facilitate the management of Union funding, to help accelerate investments in Member States and regions, and to improve the availability of funding to the economy, Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (4) was amended by Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the increase of interim payments from the Funds by an amount corresponding to ten percentage points above the actual co-financing rate for each priority axis for Member States which are facing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and have requested to benefit from this measure.
(4) Article 77(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 allows for the application of an increased co-financing rate up to 31 December 2013. However, since Member States still face serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, the duration of the application of an increased co-financing rate should not be limited to 31 December 2013.
(5) In line with the European Council conclusions of 7-8 February 2013 and as provided for in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), the co-financing rate increased by 10 percentage points is to apply with regard to the 2014-2020 programming period until 30 June 2016, when the possibility of the increase is to be reviewed. As the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 programming periods overlap, it is necessary to ensure coherent and uniform treatment of Member States receiving financial assistance during the two periods. Therefore, these Member States receiving financial assistance should also benefit from the increase of the co-financing rate until the end of the eligibility period and to claim it in their requests for final balance even if the financial assistance is not anymore provided.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 aims to contribute to achieving adequate concentration of cohesion funding on the least developed regions and Member States. In order to contribute to the reduction of disparities in average per capita aid intensities, the maximum level of transfer (capping) from the Funds to each individual Member State pursuant to future Regulations is to be fixed at 2,35 % of the GDP of the Member State. The capping is to be applied on an annual basis, and, if applicable, is to proportionally reduce all transfers (except for the more developed regions and the European territorial cooperation goal) to the Member State concerned in order to obtain the maximum level of transfer. For Member States which acceded to the Union before 2013 and whose average real GDP growth in the 2008-2010 period was lower than – 1 %, the maximum level of transfer is to be fixed at 2,59 % of their GDP.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 caps the allocations per Member State at 110 % of their level in real terms for the 2007-2013 period. Member States affected by this capping need to be further protected from the risk of automatic decommitment of allocations in the 2007-2013 period.
(8) In its conclusions of 8 February 2013, the European Council invited the Commission to explore practical solutions with regard to reducing the risk of automatic decommitment of the Funds from the 2007-2013 national envelope for Romania and Slovakia, including the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.
(9) The European Council also highlighted the need to ensure a manageable level and profile for the payments in all headings in order to limit the outstanding budgetary commitments in particular by applying rules for automatic decommitment in all headings. Hence, provisions releasing the decommitment rules for Member States affected by the capping set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 should be balanced in view of its effects on the outstanding budgetary commitments.
(10) The deadline for the calculation of the automatic decommitment of the annual budget commitments for years 2011 and 2012 should be extended by one year, but the 2012 budget commitment, which will still be open on 31 December 2015, is to be justified by 31 December 2015. That extension should help to improve the absorption of funding committed for operational programmes in Member States that are affected by the capping of their future cohesion policy allocations at 110 % of their level in real terms for the 2007-2013 period. Such flexibility is necessary in order to address a slower than expected implementation of programmes affecting those Member States in particular.
(11) Limited adjustments of the maximum amount of assistance from the Funds for each priority axis should be applied when establishing the amount of the final balance to be paid to the operational programmes in order to optimise the absorption of the Funds.
(12) Given the unprecedented nature of the crisis, swift adoption of support measures is needed and therefore it is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '20.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 347/253', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 1297/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 December 2013\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to financial management for certain Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, to the decommitment rules for certain Member States, and to the rules on payments of the final balance', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The unprecedented enduring global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in the Member States.

laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 concerning imports into the Community of rice originating in and coming from Egypt
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 of 28 October 1996 concerning imports into the Community of rice originating in and coming from Egypt (1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Articles 10(2) and 13(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 196/97 (3) of 31 January 1997 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 concerning imports into the Community of rice originating in and coming from Egypt. Since its entry into force, horizontal or sectoral implementing regulations, that is, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (5), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (6), have been adopted or amended, and must be taken into account in respect of the quota opened by Regulation (EC) No 196/97.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed rules for applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down by the sectoral regulations. For the sake of clarity, therefore, the administration of the Community tariff quotas for imports of rice originating in Egypt should be adapted by adopting a new regulation and repealing Regulation (EC) No 196/97.
(3) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2184/96 opens an overall tariff quota of 32 000 tonnes of rice falling within CN code 1006 originating in Egypt per marketing year. The customs duty is that provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, in accordance with Articles 11, 11a, 11b, 11c and 11d thereof, reduced by an amount equal to 25 % of the value of that duty. Taking into account the potential application of different customs duties, the conditions for the application of the 25 % reduction should be laid down.
(4) In the interests of sound administration of the quota, it is necessary to allow operators to submit more than one licence application per quota period and therefore to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. For the same reason, the specific rules which apply to the drawing up of licence applications, their issue, their period of validity and the notification of information to the Commission should be laid down, as should suitable administrative measures in order to ensure that the volume of the quota fixed is not exceeded. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period. Moreover, in order to improve controls on this quota and to simplify its administration, provision should be made for import licence applications to be submitted on a weekly basis, and the security should be fixed at a level appropriate to the risks involved.
(5) The rules applicable to the transport document and the proof of preferential origin on release for free circulation of the product are set out in Protocol 4 to Council Decision 2004/635/EC of 21 April 2004 on the conclusion of a Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Arab Republic of Egypt, of the other part (7). Detailed rules for implementing those provisions should be laid down for the quota in question.
(6) These measures should apply from the start of the next marketing year, that is, 1 September 2007.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (1), and in particular Article 60(2), Article 145(c), (d) and (d)(b) and Article 155 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (2) introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005.
(2) Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 319/2006 defines the rules for the de-coupled support and the integration of the support for sugar beet, cane and chicory into the single payment scheme. The related detailed rules should therefore be adopted. Those detailed rules should follow the same lines as those already laid down in Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 with regard to olive oil, tobacco, cotton and hops.
(4) The application of Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to all sectors included in the single payment scheme after the first year of application may lead to the situation that the amounts that remain in the national reserve after allocation of reference amounts from that national reserve in the cases provided for in that Article are not needed anymore to cover any further cases. In that case the Member States should be authorised to increase proportionally the unit value of all payment entitlements.
(5) Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 provides for the detailed rules for farmers who made investments in production capacity or who leased parcels on a long-term basis. Those provisions need to be adapted in order to take into account the special situation of farmers in the sugar sector who made such investments or entered into such long-term lease-contracts before the entry into force of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (3).
(6) Experience shows that there is a need for clarification of the dates at which a farmer applying for aid under the single payment scheme has to hold the payment entitlements.
(7) The rules in case of transfers of payment entitlements should be clarified in order to enable a transfer to take place on the date foreseen in the communication of the transfer to the competent authority, unless the competent authority objects to the transfer and notifies the transferor thereof within the time period established by the Member State.
(8) Article 48c of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 needs to be adapted in respect of Member States which already started to apply the single payment scheme in 2005.
(9) The integration of the sugar reference amounts into the single payment scheme was decided by Council Regulation (EC) No 319/2006 of 20 February 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers. Member States therefore only have very short time-limits to take the necessary steps to comply with that integration. Measures should be taken to ensure a smooth transition from the old sugar-related schemes to the integration into the single payment scheme. In particular, it should be ensured that farmers may make use of their rights within reasonable time-limits. Where that possibility is at jeopardy, Member States should have to provide for a prolongation of the application time-limits fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
(10) In order to avoid that the sugar sector is submitted to a second linear percentage reduction of the reference amounts in case of overshoot of the national ceilings referred to in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, it is appropriate to clarify the application of Article 41(2) of that Regulation.
(11) In accordance with Article 42(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, the national reserve has to be replenished by a linear reduction of all the reference amounts. Rules need to be established to clarify how Member States who already applied the single payment scheme in 2005 have to proceed with regard to the integration of the reference amount for sugar beet, cane and chicory into the replenishment of the national reserve.
(12) The specific rules provided for in Article 48d of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 need to be extended to include sugar beet, cane and chicory support.
(13) A further time-limit concerning the dates provided for in Article 49a of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004, by which Member States have to communicate certain information to the Commission, needs to be granted with regard to the integration of sugar beet, cane and chicory support.
(14) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 fixes the date from which the growing of secondary crops may be temporarily allowed in regions where cereals are usually harvested sooner for climatic reasons as referred to in Article 51(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. At the request of Greece, that date should be fixed for that Member State.
(15) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 fixed the average number of hectares referred to in Article 60(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 on the basis of the data communicated to the Commission by the Member States concerned. Finland has communicated the relevant data. It is therefore appropriate to fix also the number of hectares for that Member State.
(16) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(17) Due to the fact that the transfer of entitlements may start as from 1 January 2006, it is appropriate to provide that this Regulation applies retroactively from that date.
(18) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Direct Payments,","{'header': '29.4.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 116/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 658/2006\nof 27 April 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers(2)introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005.\n\n((2)) Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.\n\n((3)) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 319/2006 defines the rules for the de-coupled support and the integration of the support for sugar beet, cane and chicory into the single payment scheme.

(1) On 22 October 1999, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, in the context of the World Health Organisation (WHO), a Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and related protocols. This authorisation was amended by the Council on 21 April 2001 and, on 20 December 2007, in relation to the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products (‘the Protocol’). Negotiations were conducted by the Commission within the terms of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council and were successfully finalised by the adoption of the Protocol at the fifth Conference of the Parties to the WHO FCTC on 12 November 2012, in Seoul, Republic of Korea.
(2) The conclusion of the FCTC was approved on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 2004/513/EC (1), which is a condition for the European Union’s becoming a Party to the Protocol.
(3) The Protocol represents a significant contribution to the international efforts to eliminate all forms of illicit trade in tobacco products, which constitutes an essential component of tobacco control.
(4) The Protocol sets out obligations for the contracting parties related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, the definition of criminal offences, and police cooperation. As a consequence, those provisions fall within the scope of Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
(5) As the Protocol covers matters that fall within the Union’s competence, the Protocol should be signed on behalf of the Union, subject to its conclusion at a later date.
(6) By signing the Protocol, the Union will not be exercising shared competence, hence Member States retain their competence in the areas covered by the Protocol which do not affect common rules or alter the scope of such rules.
(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 21) on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and without prejudice to Article 4 of that Protocol, those Member States are not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application.
(8) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

Whereas, because of the outbreak of classical swine fever in certain production regions in Germany, protection and surveillance zones have been established by the German authorities pursuant to Article 9 of Council Directive 80/217/EEC of 22 January 1980 introducing Community measures for the control of classical swine fever (3), as last amended by Decision 93/384/EEC (4); whereas, consequently, in these zones the trade in live pigs, fresh pigmeat and pigmeat products which have not been subjected to heat treatment is temporarily prohibited;
Whereas restrictions on the free movement of goods resulting from the application of veterinary measures are likely to bring about a serious disturbance of the pigmeat market in Germany; whereas exceptional market support measures, to apply for no longer than is strictly necessary, must accordingly be adopted with respect solely to live animals from the affected areas;
Whereas, with the aim of preventing a further spread of the disease, the pigs produced in the said zones should be separated from normal trade in products intended for human consumption and processed into products intended for uses other than human consumption, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 3 of Council Directive 90/667/EEC (5), amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (6);
Whereas it is appropriate to grant an aid for the delivery to the competent authorities of live fattened pigs and piglets coming from the affected zones;
Whereas in view of the extent of the disease and, in particular, of its duration, and consequently of the magnitude of the efforts needed to support the market, it would be appropriate for such efforts to be shared by the Community and the Member State concerned;
Whereas provision should be made for the German authorities to adopt all necessary control and surveillance measures and to inform the Commission accordingly;
Whereas the restrictions on the free movement of live pigs have been operative for several weeks now in the zones in question, provoking a substantial increase in the weight of the animals and consequently leading to an intolerable situation where the welfare of the animals is concerned; whereas retroactive application of this Regulation from 18 February 1997 is therefore justified;

The level of male sterility shall be assessed by examining flowers for the absence of fertile  anthers;\n\n(c) the distance from neighbouring sources of pollen which may result in undesirable foreign  pollination shall be at least 500 m for the production of basic seed and at leasts 300 m for the  production of certified seed. These distances can be disregarded if there is sufficient protection  from any undesirable foreign pollination;\n\n(d) the number of field inspections shall be at least three. The first inspection should be made  before the flowering stage, the second inspection at the early flowering stage and the third  inspection at the end of the flowering stage.\n\n2.  Conditions to be satisfied by the seed:\n\n(a) the seed shall have sufficient identity and purity as regards the varietal characteristics of  its components, including restoration of male sterility or, as the case may be, fertility;\n\n(b) the minimum varietal purity shall confirm to the following standards:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nThe minimum varietal purity shall be examined mainly in field inspections carried out in accordance  with point 1.\n\n3.  Seed shall not be certified as certified seed unless due account has been taken of the results  of official post-control plot tests on samples of basic seed taken officially and carried out  during the growing season of the seed entered for certification as certified seed to ascertain  whether the basic seed has met the requirements for basic seed laid down in this Decision in  respect of identity and purity as regards the characteristics of the components, including male  sterility.\n\nIn the case of basic seed of hybrids, the varietal purity may be assessed, not by post-control plot  tests but by appropriate biochemical methods. The conditions under which such tests are carried out  may be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 20 of Directive  69/208/EEC.\n\n4.  In the case of certified seed of a varietal association, the seed of the 'pollinator-dependent  hybrid` and of the 'pollinator(s)` shall be mechanically combined in proportions jointly determined  by the persons responsible for the maintenance of those components. The seed of the female and male  components shall be dressed using different coloured seed dressings.\n\n5.  The standards in respect of the minimum varietal purity laid down in the table under point 2 in  respect of certified seed of hybrids shall be monitored by official post-control tests on samples  taken officially.\n\nIn the case of certified seed of hybrids, the varietal purity may be assessed, not by post-control  plo tests but by appropriate biochemical methods.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 21 June 2013
abrogating Decision 2010/286/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in Italy
(2013/314/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 2 December 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Decision 2010/286/EU (1), that an excessive deficit existed in Italy. The Council noted that the general government deficit planned for 2009 was 5,3 % of GDP, thus above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value, while the general government gross debt was planned to reach 115,1 % of GDP in 2009, thus above the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value (2).
(2) On 2 December 2009, in accordance with Article 126(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (3), the Council, based on a Recommendation from the Commission, addressed a recommendation to Italy with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2012 at the latest. That Recommendation was made public.
(3) In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt, and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4).
(4) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit ought to be abrogated, the Council has to take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 %-of-GDP threshold over the forecast horizon.
(5) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat), in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, following the notification by Italy before 1 April 2013, the 2013 Stability Programme, the Commission services’ 2013 spring forecast, and the assessment of additional measures adopted in decree-law 54 of 21 May 2013, the following conclusions are justified:
— After peaking at 5,5 % of GDP in 2009, Italy's general government deficit was steadily brought down and reached 3,0 % of GDP in 2012, which was the deadline set by the Council. The improvement was driven by significant fiscal consolidation, while in 2012 interest expenditure was 0,8 percentage point of GDP higher than in 2009 and the composition of economic activity was tax poorer.
— The stability programme for 2013-17, adopted by the Italian government on 10 April 2013 and endorsed by parliament on 7 May, plans the deficit to decline slightly to 2,9 % of GDP in 2013 and then fall to 1,8 % of GDP in 2014. Based on the no-policy-change assumption, the Commission services' 2013 Spring forecast projects a deficit of 2,9 % of GDP in 2013 and, 2,5 % of GDP in 2014. Both the stability programme and the Spring forecast include the impact of decree-law 35 of 8 April 2013, which provides for the settlement of trade debt arrears owed by the general government sector to private suppliers, for an overall amount of EUR 40 billion (or around 2,5 % of GDP) over 2013-14. While this amount translates into a corresponding increase of the general government debt, it affects the deficit only for the part that is related to capital expenditure. The decree law sets these payments at 0,5 % of GDP in 2013, with a corresponding increase in the deficit. It also includes a safeguard clause that authorises the government to delay the settlement of deficit-increasing trade debt arrears or adopt other corrective measures, in order to ensure the achievement of the 2013 budgetary target.
— The Italian Parliament formally endorsed the budgetary objectives put forward in the 2013 stability programme on 7 May. On 17 May, namely after the spring forecast, the new government issued a formal declaration to confirm these commitments and announce the adoption of new measures in the full respect of the budgetary objectives in the stability programme. Decree-law 54, adopted on the same date, sets out the new measures. These include:
— the suspension of the June instalment of the property tax on owner-occupied houses, excluding luxury residences, as well as agricultural property, while committing the government to an overall redesign of the legislation on real estate taxation. A safeguard clause ensures that the redesign has to be made in the full respect of the budgetary targets in primary terms; furthermore, if the budgetary-neutral reform fails to be approved by the end of August 2013, the suspended property tax instalment will have to be paid by 16 September.
— the extension of the wage supplementation scheme to workers not already covered for the year 2013, by reallocating available budgetary resources over and above those set aside with the 2012 labour-market reform.
— Overall, the new provisions are assessed to have no significant impact on the deficit, if consistently implemented. Therefore, the deficit is set to remain below the reference value of 3 % of GDP in a durable way.
— After improving by nearly 2¾ percentage points of GDP in cumulative terms between 2009 and 2012, the structural balance, namely adjusted for the economic cycle and net of one-off and other temporary measures, is forecast to further improve by nearly 1 percentage point in 2013 (to around -½ % of GDP) and worsen slightly in 2014, based on a no-policy-change assumption.
— The debt-to-GDP ratio rose by 10,6 percentage points between 2009 and 2012, to 127,0 %, also due to Italy's contribution to financial assistance to the Member States of the euro area. As cyclical conditions remain negative, the gross government debt is forecast to increase to 131,4 % of GDP in 2013 and 132,2 % in 2014 also due to the 2,5 percentage points of GDP settlement of trade debt arrears planned over 2013-14 and further contributions to financial assistance to the Member States of the euro area.
(6) Starting in 2013, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, Italy should progress towards its medium-term budgetary objective at an appropriate pace, including respecting the expenditure benchmark, and make sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt criterion in accordance with Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) 1467/97.
(7) In accordance with Article 126(12) TFEU, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(8) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in Italy has been corrected and Decision 2010/286/EU should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '26.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 173/41', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 21 June 2013\nabrogating Decision 2010/286/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in Italy\n(2013/314/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 2 December 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Decision 2010/286/EU(1), that an excessive deficit existed in Italy.

of 12 June 2013
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 (3) establishes a general prohibition of the practice of ‘shark finning’, whereby a shark’s fins are removed and the remainder of the shark is discarded at sea.
(2) Fish belonging to the taxon Elasmobranchii, including sharks, skates and rays, are generally very vulnerable to overexploitation due to the characteristics of their life cycle, which include slow growth, late maturity and a small number of young, although biological productivity is not the same for all species. Generally, in recent years, some shark populations have been severely targeted, including by vessels flying the flag of a Member State that are operating in Union and non-Union waters, and put under serious threat as a result of a dramatic increase in demand for shark products, and for shark fins in particular.
(3) Shark fins do not constitute a traditional ingredient of the European diet, but sharks do constitute a necessary element of the Union’s marine ecosystem. The management and conservation of shark stocks, as well as, more generally, the promotion of a fishing sector that is sustainably managed for the benefit of the environment and of the people working in the sector, should therefore be a priority.
(4) Current scientific knowledge, based on the examination of shark catch rates, generally indicates that many shark stocks are under serious threat, although the situation is not the same for all species or even for the same species in different maritime zones. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), more than 25 % of all pelagic shark species, of which over 50 % are large oceanic-pelagic sharks, are threatened. In recent years, the capture, retention on board, transhipment, or landing of a growing number of shark species, including that of sharks whose fins are highly valuable in trade, has been prohibited under Union law or within the framework of regional fisheries management organisations.
(5) Blue shark (Priconace glauca) and shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), classified by the IUCN as ‘near-threatened’ and ‘vulnerable’ respectively, are currently the predominant species of shark captured by the Union fleet, with blue shark accounting for approximately 70 % of total reported shark landings. Other species, however, including hammerhead and silky sharks, are also subject to capture in Union and non-Union waters and contribute to the economic viability of fisheries.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 currently allows Member States to issue special fishing permits allowing sharks to be processed on board by removing their fins from their bodies. In order to ensure that there is a correlation between the weight of a shark’s fins and its body, a ‘fin-to-carcass’ ratio has been established. There are serious control and enforcement difficulties with the use of the ‘fin-to-carcass’ ratio. The use of such a ratio is insufficient to eliminate the practice of high-grading and, due to differences in fin-cutting techniques and the variability of the fin size and weight of different shark species, its use could lead to finning going undetected. Following processing operations, fins and bodies can be landed in different ports. In these circumstances, the collection of data, inter alia, on species identification and populations structure, underpinning scientific advice for the establishment of fisheries conservation and management measures, is hampered.
(7) In light of the International Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks adopted in 1999 by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the Union should adopt all measures necessary for the conservation of sharks and to minimise waste and discards from shark catches. In its conclusions of 23 April 2009, the Council endorsed the Union’s overall approach and specific objectives, as set out in the related Commission Communication on a European Community Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks of 5 February 2009. The Council also encouraged the Commission to pay particular attention to the issue of the removal of shark fins and to present, as soon as possible, a proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003, in particular with reference to the derogations and the associated conditions laid down therein.
(8) The Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) acknowledges the problem of shark finning, calls for its eradication, without derogations, and advises that all elasmobranch species should be landed with their fins/wings naturally attached to their bodies.
(9) Regional fisheries management organisations are increasingly addressing the issue of shark finning. In addition, their scientific bodies are showing a preference for sharks to be landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies and are noting that this is the best way to prevent finning and to facilitate the collection of data needed for stock assessments. The annual resolutions on sustainable fisheries issued by the United Nations General Assembly since 2007, the 2008 IUCN Global Policy against shark finning and the 2010 Meeting of the Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference have all called on nations to take measures requiring that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies.
(10) In 2010 and 2011, as part of the required impact assessment exercise, the Commission held a public consultation in order to gather information on the most appropriate manner in which to amend Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003. The Commission concluded in its impact assessment that, in order to achieve the basic objective of conserving shark stocks, that Regulation should provide that all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies.
(11) Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '29.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 181/1', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 605/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 12 June 2013\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 on the removal of fins of sharks on board vessels', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003(3)establishes a general prohibition of the practice of ‘shark finning’, whereby a shark’s fins are removed and the remainder of the shark is discarded at sea.\n\n((2)) Fish belonging to the taxonElasmobranchii, including sharks, skates and rays, are generally very vulnerable to overexploitation due to the characteristics of their life cycle, which include slow growth, late maturity and a small number of young, although biological productivity is not the same for all species.

In its conclusions of 23 April 2009, the Council endorsed the Union’s overall approach and specific objectives, as set out in the related Commission Communication on a European Community Action Plan for the Conservation and Management of Sharks of 5 February 2009. The Council also encouraged the Commission to pay particular attention to the issue of the removal of shark fins and to present, as soon as possible, a proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003, in particular with reference to the derogations and the associated conditions laid down therein.\n\n((8)) The Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) acknowledges the problem of shark finning, calls for its eradication, without derogations, and advises that all elasmobranch species should be landed with their fins/wings naturally attached to their bodies.\n\n((9)) Regional fisheries management organisations are increasingly addressing the issue of shark finning. In addition, their scientific bodies are showing a preference for sharks to be landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies and are noting that this is the best way to prevent finning and to facilitate the collection of data needed for stock assessments. The annual resolutions on sustainable fisheries issued by the United Nations General Assembly since 2007, the 2008 IUCN Global Policy against shark finning and the 2010 Meeting of the Fish Stocks Agreement Review Conference have all called on nations to take measures requiring that all sharks are landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies.\n\n((10)) In 2010 and 2011, as part of the required impact assessment exercise, the Commission held a public consultation in order to gather information on the most appropriate manner in which to amend Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003. The Commission concluded in its impact assessment that, in order to achieve the basic objective of conserving shark stocks, that Regulation should provide that all sharks be landed with their fins naturally attached to their bodies.\n\n((11)) Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Reports', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1185/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 2, point 3 is deleted;\n(2)\nin Article 3, the following paragraph is inserted:\n‘1a.\xa0\xa0\xa0Without prejudice to paragraph 1, in order to facilitate on-board storage, shark fins may be partially sliced through and folded against the carcass, but shall not be removed from the carcass before landing.’;\n(3)\nArticles 4 and 5 are deleted;\n(4)\nArticle 6 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 6\nReports\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Where vessels flying the flag of a Member State catch, retain on-board, tranship or land sharks, the flag Member State, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy\n(\n*1\n)\nand Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009\n(\n*2\n)\n, shall send to the Commission, annually, by 1 May, a comprehensive report on its implementation of this Regulation during the previous year.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field [1], and in particular Article 24(1) and (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for the possibility of a financial contribution from the Community for the eradication and monitoring of the diseases contained in the list annexed to that Decision.
(2) The list may be supplemented or amended to take account of developments in the health situation in the Community.
(3) Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) is a new disease that appeared for the first time in the Community in 1998 which has the potential of causing important losses for the salmon farming industry.
(4) It is important that ISA is controlled so as to prevent its further spread to other areas.
(5) Bluetongue is an arthropod-borne viral disease of sheep, goats, cattle and other ruminants.
(6) Bluetongue has an impact at international level on movements of live animals of sensitive species in that it is included on List A of the World Organisation for Animal Health.
(7) In 1998 Bluetongue entered from abroad the territory of the Community and spread via infected vectors.
(8) Certain areas of the European Union must, due to climatic conditions, be considered as Bluetongue high risk areas.
(9) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for emergency measures caused by Bluetongue outbreaks. A Community financial contribution is also required for monitoring and certain control measures including vaccination against Bluetongue in high risk areas or in areas where the disease is endemic.
(10) In the light of these developments, ISA and Bluetongue should be added to the list in question so that a Community financial contribution can be obtained for the implementation of programmes for the eradication and monitoring of these diseases. In the case of Bluetongue, specific criteria should be adopted to enable the financial measure provided for in Article 24(1) of Decision 90/424/EEC to be implemented.
(11) In order to be eligible for a Community financial contribution, the relevant requirements of Decision 90/424/EEC and, with regard to ISA, Council Directive 93/53/EEC of 24 June 1993 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases [2] must be respected.
(12) Council Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 of 17 December 1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance in the fisheries sector [3] and in particular Article 15(3)(g) thereof, is the appropriate legal basis for ensuring a financial assistance with regard to ISA; therefore the provisions of Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds [4] are applicable by derogation to those provided for under Article 24, paragraphs 5, 6, second sentence, 8 and 9 of Decision 90/424/EEC.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 10 June 1986
concerning aid which the Belgian Government has granted to a ceramic sanitary ware and crockery manufacturer
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(86/366/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By Decisions of 16 February 1983 and 24 October 1984 the Commission found that the Bfrs 475 million and Bfrs 83 million in aid granted without prior notification in 1981 and 1983 to a ceramics manufacturer at La Louvière in the form of subscriptions of new capital was incompatible with the common market and therefore had to be withdrawn. These Decisions gave rise to Cases 52/84 and 40/85 before the Court of Justice and have not yet been implemented.
The Commission, having learnt of the Belgian Government's intention to provide the firm in question with fresh support, again through the agency of its regional authorities, in the form of a subscription of Bfrs 295,3 million of new capital, informed the Belgian Government by letter dated 14 June 1984 that the support had to be notified under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty and asked it to effect such notification within a period of 15 days.
The Belgian Government answered the Commission's request by telexes dated 29 June and 19 July 1984, informing it of its decision to participate in a 295,3 million capital increase, planned but not yet carried out, by the firm. It stressed that it was at the Commission's express request that the notification was being made, as in its view the share purchase was not an aid within the meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty and was therefore not subject to the prior notification obligation laid down in Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty. The capital increase was intended to enable the firm to undertake investments mainly in the crockery division.
The Commission decided on 23 August 1984 to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the aid proposal. It considered that the financial support in question constituted an aid within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty and that the aid did not appear to satisfy the conditions necessary for application of one of the exceptions contained in Article 92 (2) and (3), and gave the Belgian Government notice, by letter dated 27 August 1984, to submit its observations.
II
The Belgian Government answered the Commission's letter by telex dated 26 September 1984, in which it repeated its opinion that the share purchase in question constituted, not a State aid, but a decision comparable to that of a private shareholder, in view of the substantial costs that would be incurred if the firm were to close. It pointed out that the capital increase plan aimed primarily to finance investment in the sanitary ware division, involving no increase in capacity, and that the firm's overall operating results had improved considerably. By letter dated 22 March 1985 the Belgian Government announced that the regional authorities had decided, on 16 January 1985, to wind up the firm and that as a result the Bfrs 295,3 million capital increase had not taken place.
Within the framework of the consultation of other interested parties, the Governments of four other Member States, three national industrial federations, one European federation and two firms in the same industry indicated that they shared the Commission's concern about aid granted in Belgium to the firm in question and underlined the serious distortions of competition that stem from the Belgian Government's repeated aid awards, since they enable the firm concerned to sell its products on any terms.
III
The provision of public funds to companies in the form of subscriptions of new capital may involve elements of State aid. The company in the present case was handicapped by its financial position and by the current overcapacity in the crockery and ceramic sanitary ware industry, which made it unlikely that it would be able to raise on the private capital market the finance necessary for its survival.
The firm made substantial losses for a number of years: Bfrs 134 million in 1979, Bfrs 243 million in 1980, Bfrs 302 million in 1981, Bfrs 168 million in 1982 and Bfrs 98 million in 1983. These losses represented respectively 23, 39, 45, 20 and 11 % of its turnover in those years. The firm's accumulated arrears to the social security fund also increased between 1979 and 1983 from Bfrs 120,8 million to 248,5 million. If the Bfrs 475 million granted in 1981 and the Bfrs 83 million granted in 1983 had been withdrawn as ordered by the Commission in its Decisions of 16 February 1983 and 24 October 1984 respectively, the firm's financial position would have been even worse.
In these circumstances, a capital injection, whether directly or indirectly out of public funds, provided the firm with financial resources which did not at all correspond to its credit rating on the private capital market.
Although the Belgian Government claimed in its letter of 22 March 1985 that the Bfrs 295,3 million capital increase had not taken place and that the regional authorities had decided to wind up the firm, the Commission has discovered that an advance of Bfrs 104 million on that amount was in fact paid to the firm in 1984, enabling it to continue manufacturing and selling crockery and sanitary ware until its sanitary ware division was taken over in August 1985 by a new legal entity set up in March 1985 on the regional authorities' behalf. This advance, which was never mentioned in the correspondence from the Belgian Government but whose existence is confirmed by the annual report of the Wallonia Regional Investment Corporation for 1984, kept the firm going artificially for several months and hence constitutes rescue aid.
The firm used to be the largest of the three Belgian sanitary ware producers. Its sales amounted to 6 111 tonnes in 1979, 6 289 in 1980, 6 544 in 1981, 7 386 in 1982, 7 733 in 1983 and 7 601 in 1984, of which 57,7, 61,5, 71,2 74,3, 79,3 and 76 % respectively was exported. It had a share of the Belgian market varying between 20 and 25 % and its exports accounted for 7,9, 9,3, 12,3, 14,9 and 15,2 % respectively of all intra-Community trade in the sector in question between 1979 and 1983.
In 1983, according to the firm's own figures, it supplied 7 % of the Dutch market and 6 % of the German market in sanitary ware, selling 15 % of its output in the Netherlands, 46 % in Germany, 10 % in France, 3 % in the United Kingdom and 5 % in eleven other countries. Its exports outside the common market were minimal.
The average export prices charged by the firm were invariably lower than the average prices of all Belgian sanitary ware exports and all intra-Community trade between 1979 and 1983 in sanitary ware, reaching 78 to 82 % of the Community level and 80 to 85 % of the Belgian level.
Exports of sanitary ware (NIMEXE code 69.10-10) from the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union to the other Member States have increased considerably since 1979, although the market, suffering the effects of the downturn in the building industry, has stagnated. They came to 8 650 tonnes in 1979, 9 339 in 1980, 10 556 in 1981, 11 042 in 1982, 14 090 in 1983 and 14 110 in 1984, or 19,4, 22,4, 27,8, 29,9, 34,8 and 35,1 % respectively of all intra-Community trade in sanitary ware (in terms of weight).
The Commission has no data on production, sales, exports and prices of the firm's crockery.
BLEU exports of crockery (NIMEXE codes 69.11 and 69.12) to the other Member States between 1979 and 1984 remained static at 5 to 6 000 tonnes a year, or about 5 % of intra-Community trade.
In view of the above, the aid in question, which undoubtedly favoured the firm concerned, has affected trade between Member States and threatened to distort competition in the common market within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty. Article 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market. The exceptions provided for in Article 92 (2) are not applicable in this case because of the nature of the proposed assistance, which is not directed towards such objectives.
Article 92 (3) of the Treaty lists the aid which may be compatible with the common market. Compatibility with the Treaty must be determined in the context of the Community as a whole and not of a single Member State. In order to ensure the proper functioning of the common market, and having regard to the principle embodied in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) must be construed narrowly when any aid scheme or any individual award under a general scheme is scrutinized.
In particular, they may be invoked only when the Commission is satisfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would be insufficient to guide the recipients towards patterns of behaviour that would serve one of the objectives of the said exceptions.
To apply the exceptions where there is no such compensating benefit or where the aid is not necessary for the attainment of one of those objectives would be to give unfair advantages to the industries of certain Member States by improving their financial position and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3).
The Belgian Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the aid in question falls into any of the categories of exception provided for in Article 92 (3).
With regard to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aid that promotes or facilitates the development of certain areas, the La Louvière area, though eligible under the Belgian regional aid scheme, on account of its poor socio-economic situation, is not one where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (a), and the Belgian aid award does not have the requisite features of aid to facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (c), inasmuch as it is not conditional on initial investment or job creation as explained in the 1979 Commission communication on the principles of coordination of regional aid systems (1).
Nor, of course, has the aid measure the features of a 'project of common European interest' or of a project likely to 'remedy a serious disturbance' in the Belgian economy, so as to qualify for the exception in Article 92 (3) (b). Belgium belongs to the central regions of the Community, which do not have, by Community standards, the most severe economic and social problems and in which there is a greater danger than elsewhere of a competitive bidding-up of aid and of aid affecting trade between Member States.
As to the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) for 'aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities', the situation of the crockery and ceramic sanitary ware industry, and particularly the overcapacity that exists in that industry in the Community, suggests that to preserve capacity artificially through aid is against the common interest. This holds true even if, without such aid, the firm concerned might have had to close.
The Belgian Government has produced no cogent evidence to support its case.
In its message of 19 July 1984, it maintained firstly that the Bfrs 295,3 million capital injection would enable the firm to undertake mainly rationalization investments which would lead to no increase in production capacity and would be centred on the crockery division, and secondly that it was essential to the firm's survival. Subsequently, in its telex of 26 September 1984 it contended, firstly, that the capital injection would be used primarily to finance rationalization investments in the firm's sanitary ware division involving no capacity increase and would be made with a view to the firm's modernization and possible splitting up, and, secondly, that closure was the alternative to making available the extra money needed for the modernization drive.
Quite apart from the inconsistencies between them, these arguments do not convince the Commission that the Bfrs 295,3 million in aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest. The Belgian Government's plan to give the recipient firm Bfrs 295,3 million in the form of a subscription of new capital therefore does not qualify for application of any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
Lastly, as regards the advance payment of Bfrs 104 million made unlawfully in 1984, this aid enabled the recipient firm to carry on its ceramic sanitary ware operations until they were taken over by the new legal entity in August 1985.
It also enabled it to continue its crockery production until the decision was taken to wind the firm up in January 1985. Crockery sales continued even after that date.
The recipient firm's operations have already been maintained artificially for a number of years by repeated government subsidies. Like that aid, the Bfrs 104 million advance does not, for the reasons given above, qualify for application of any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3).
Although the recipient firm has since been wound up, the Commission considers that the adoption of a final negative decision regarding the two aid measures in question is necessary. This Decision fulfils in particular the requirement that the Bfrs 104 million in aid unlawfully granted but recovered and that competing firms' rights be protected in so far as they have suffered loss or damage as a result of the infringement of the Treaty's provisions on State aid,","{'title': '86/366/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 June 1986 concerning aid which the Belgian Government has granted to a ceramic sanitary ware and crockery manufacturer (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (3) of the Treaty lists the aid which may be compatible with the common market.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC (2), and in particular Article 13 (4) thereof,

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Because of an outbreak of avian influenza in certain production regions in Italy between December 1999 and April 2000, between August and October 2000 and between October 2002 and September 2003, veterinary and trade restrictions were adopted by the Italian authorities under, in particular, Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza (2). As a result, the transport and marketing of hatching eggs were temporarily banned within Italy or within the areas directly affected by the outbreak.
(2) The restrictions on the free movement of hatching eggs resulting from the application of the veterinary measures threatened severe disruption of the market in hatching eggs in Italy. The Italian authorities adopted market support measures for the period for which this was absolutely necessary. These allowed hatching eggs falling within CN code 0407 00 19 for which incubation was no longer possible to be processed into egg products and the destruction of hatching eggs falling within CN codes 0407 00 19 and 0407 00 11.
(3) These measures had a beneficial effect on the market in hatching eggs. This justifies their being treated as an exceptional market support measure within the meaning of Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 and the grant of aid to compensate for part of the financial loss resulting from the processing or destruction of hatching eggs.
(4) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,","{'header': '10.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 365/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2102/2004\nof 9 December 2004\non certain exceptional market support measures for eggs in Italy', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Because of an outbreak of avian influenza in certain production regions in Italy between December 1999 and April 2000, between August and October 2000 and between October 2002 and September 2003, veterinary and trade restrictions were adopted by the Italian authorities under, in particular, Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza(2).
