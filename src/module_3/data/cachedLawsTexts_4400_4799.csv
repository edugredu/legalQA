(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) lays down the rules for determining the production refunds and specifies the chemical products the basic products used in the manufacture of which attract a production refund. Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provide that the production refund applying to raw sugar, sucrose syrups and unprocessed isoglucose is to be derived from the refund fixed for white sugar in accordance with a method of calculation specific to each basic product.
(3) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provides that the production refund on white sugar is to be fixed at monthly intervals commencing on the first day of each month. It may be adjusted in the intervening period where there is a significant change in the prices for sugar on the Community and/or world markets.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a preparation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) From the Opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 16 July 2008 (2) it results that, on the basis of the data provided by the manufacturer, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it is efficacious in stabilising the gut flora. The Authority further concluded that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens CECT 5940 (Ecobiol and Ecobiol plus) does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on chicken for fattening. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) By Council Decision 97/836/EC (1), the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (2) (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’).
(2) The harmonised requirements of Regulation No 41 of the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UN/ECE) — Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor cycles with regard to noise (3) (‘UNECE Regulation No 41’) are intended to remove technical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties to the Revised 1958 Agreement and to ensure that such vehicles offer a high level of safety and protection.
(3) Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Directive 97/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and its implementing measures mandate the adoption of permissible sound levels, exhaust systems and testing procedures of two and three-wheel motor vehicles.
(4) Annex III to Chapter 9 of Directive 97/24/EC contains requirements for the type-approval of L-category vehicles with regard to their permissible sound level and exhaust system. L-category vehicles is the family name of light vehicles such as powered cycles, two or three-wheel mopeds, motor cycles with and without sidecar, tricycles and quadricycles.
(5) At the date of its accession to the Revised 1958 Agreement, the Union acceded to a limited number of UNECE Regulations listed in Annex II to Decision 97/836/EC; UNECE Regulation No 41 was not included in that list.
(6) As provided for in Article 3(3) of Decision 97/836/EC, and pursuant to Article 1(7) of the Revised 1958 Agreement, the Union may decide to apply one, some or all of the UNECE Regulations to which it has not acceded at the time of its accession to the Revised 1958 Agreement.
(7) It is now appropriate for the Union to apply UNECE Regulation No 41 in order to have common harmonised requirements at international level, which will facilitate international trade and which will replace the existing approval requirements set-out in Annex III to Chapter 9 of Directive 97/24/EC.

of 19 August 2011
adopting a work programme for the financing of the activities of the Union on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs
(2011/C 243/06)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (1), and in particular Article 75 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (2), and in particular Article 90 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (3), and in particular Articles 19, 20, 22 and 23 therof,
Whereas,
(1) Regulations (EC, Euratom) Nos 1605/2002 and 2342/2002 require that the budgetary commitments of the Union are preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the particular action involved.
(2) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the Union financial contribution towards specific veterinary measures, including information policy for animal health, animal welfare and food safety, as well as technical and scientific measures.
(3) Boar taint is an offensive odour that may occur when meat from non-castrated male pigs is heated for cooking. Only a small percentage of pigs accumulate high concentrations of androstenone, skatole and indole, the substances responsible for the odour, in their meat when they are sexually mature. While not all consumers are sensitive to boar taint, those consumers who are will reject the pig meat as inedible. As a result, paragraph 1 (p) of Chapter V of Section II of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4) provides that meat with a pronounced sexual odour is unfit for human consumption.
(4) Three main approaches to prevent boar taint in pig meat are currently pursued, namely early slaughter, removal of the testicles (surgical castration), or immunocastration (vaccination to reduce boar taint). Surgical castration of pigs is an animal welfare concern. As a result, Council Directive 2008/120/EC of 18 December 2008 laying down minimum standards for the protection of pigs (5) provides that only veterinarians or trained persons may castrate pigs and that when the pigs are seven days or older an anaesthetic and additional prolonged analgesia is to be used.
(5) The Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on a request from the Commission related to welfare aspects of the castration of piglets (6), adopted on 12 and 13 July 2004, suggests that surgical castration of pigs at any age is painful.
(6) Article 13 of the Treaty acknowledges that animals are sentient beings and that full regard is to be paid to their welfare requirements in formulating and implementing, amongst others, the Union's agriculture and internal market policies.
(7) In the European Declaration on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs (7) of December 2010, major actors of the pig sector committed on a voluntary basis to stop routine surgical castration of male pigs by 1 January 2018, provided that a European partnership on pig castration is set up to develop the necessary actions to achieve this goal.
(8) The Union should therefore invest in studies on alternatives to the surgical castration of pigs. Hence a work programme should be launched to support technical, scientific and educational measures to identify and introduce alternatives to surgical castration. The work programme should include the development of reference and screening methods for the detection of boar taint in pig meat and studies on consumer acceptance of meat and products obtained from male pigs not surgically castrated.
(9) The result of those studies may also require reconsideration of relevant Union legislation to ensure a smooth functioning of the internal market. The economic impact of the end of routine surgical castration of pigs by 1 January 2018 should be identified. It is therefore appropriate to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the cost and benefits that relevant measures would have at the different levels of the pig meat production chain.
(10) A dedicated interactive website should be set up in order to promote education and training of the main interested parties of the pig sector on the actions taken by the Union on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs.
(11) The Joint Research Centre of the Commission — Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) in Geel, Belgium, has the necessary scientific and technical expertise to develop and validate reference methods of analysis. Therefore a Union budgetary transfer covered by an administrative agreement should be awarded to the JRC-IRMM for the development of reference methods recognised by the European Union for the detection and measurement of the main compounds responsible for boar taint.
(12) For the application of this Decision, it is appropriate to define the term ‘substantial change’ within the meaning of Article 90(4) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': 'Commission Implementing Decision of 19\xa0August 2011 adopting a work programme for the financing of the activities of the Union on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe work programme for the activities of the Union on alternatives to surgical castration of pigs, as set out in the Annex (""the work programme""), is adopted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe maximum contribution for the work programme is set at EUR 1330000 and shall be financed from the following line of the general budget of the European Union for 2011:\n\n- budget line 17 04 02 01: EUR 1330000.\n\nThese appropriations may cover interest due for late payment.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nCumulated changes of the allocations to the actions covered by the work programme not exceeding 10 % of the maximum contribution provided for in Article 2 of this Decision shall not be considered to be substantial within the meaning of Article 90(4) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002, provided that those changes do not significantly affect the nature and objective of the work programme.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision constitutes a financing decision in the meaning of Article 75 of the Financial Regulation.\n\nThis Decision covers the payment of interest due for late payment pursuant to Article 83 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and Article 106(5) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 August 2011.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJohn Dalli\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n[1] OJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1.\n\n[2] OJ L 357, 31.12.2002, p. 1.\n\n[3] OJ L 155, 18.6.2009, p. 30.\n\n[4] OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 206.\n\n[5] OJ L 47, 18.2.2009, p. 5.\n\n[6] EFSA Journal (2004) 91, 1-18.\n\n[7] http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/farm/initiatives_en.htm\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nANNEX\n\nWork Programme as referred to in Article 1\n\n1.1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 (1) concerns import arrangements for products originating in State-trading countries, not liberalized at Community level;
Whereas it was laid down by the Council in Regulation (EEC) No 2456/92 of 13 July 1992 fixing the import quotas to be opened by Member States in respect of State-trading countries in 1992 (2) that the provisions of Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  3420/83, stipulating automatic extension of the previous year's quotas, would not be applicable for 1993; whereas this was done on the assumption that Community provisions covering the national restrictions which exist pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No  3420/83 would be implemented by 31 December 1992;
Whereas, to that end, the Commission put before the Council on 10 November 1992 a proposal for a Regulation concerning the uniform common rules applicable to imports from certain third countries, repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82 (3), (EEC) No  1766/82 (4) and (EEC) No 3420/83; whereas the Council has not yet taken a decision on this proposal;
Whereas, for the above reasons, certain products originating in the third countries referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 can no longer be imported into certain Member States since 1 January 1993 unless there is exceptional application of Articles  7 et seq. of that Regulation;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 7 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83, Belgium, acting on behalf of the Benelux countries, has informed the other Member States and the Commission that it considers that changes should be made, pursuant to that  Regulation, to the import arrangements applied in the Benelux to certain State-trading countries in respect of various products;
Whereas the measure proposed entails the abolition of quantitative restrictions; whereas such a measure may, in the context of purely national arrangements, jeopardize the establishment of the common arrangements referred to above aimed at freeing all  products at Community level except those subject to Community quotas and surveillance measures; whereas, pending the implementation of the common arrangements, the Benelux should be authorized to open import facilities temporarily for only small  quantities to cover its immediate requirements,","{'title': '93/506/EEC: Council Decision of 13 September 1993 changing the import arrangements established by Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 and applied in the Benelux to certain State-trading countries in respect of various products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nUnder the import arrangements laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83, the Benelux shall open import facilities, by way of exception, for the following products originating in certain State-trading countries:\n\n/* Tables: see OJ */'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 September 1993.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nPh.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/1999(2), and in particular Article 6(1a) and (4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The production potential arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(3) involve the granting of new planting rights, within a certain limit. These arrangements enter into force on 1 August 2000. The urgent need for additional rights in certain wine-growing regions has led the Council to amend Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 to permit Member States to grant some of the newly created rights in advance.
(2) Under Article 6(1a) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/1999, the Member States may grant authorisation for new planting from 1 January 2000 until the end of the 1999/2000 wine year by using up to 20 % of the newly created planting rights allocating to them under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. These rights must be used in compliance with the provisions of Title II, Chapter I of that Regulation.
(3) Sound management of the system of allocating new planting rights under Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, ensuring market equilibrium, requires knowledge of the exact situation with regard to the production potential involved.
(4) The Council acknowledges this requirement in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, in which it indicates that, to encourage Member States to compile an inventory, access to the regularisation of unlawfully planted areas, the increase in planting rights and support for restructuring and conversion should be limited to those who have compiled an inventory.
(5) It is therefore essential in such cases to determine the data relating to production potential before new rights are granted so as to avoid the risk of market disruption.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (1), and in particular Article 33(2) and (3) and Article 38(d) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 (2) sets out the list of third countries whose systems of production and control measures for organic production of agricultural products are recognised as equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.
(2) The Republic of Korea submitted a request in accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 to the Commission to be included in the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 for certain processed agricultural products. It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of that information, subsequent discussions with the authorities of the Republic of Korea and an on-the-spot examination of the rules of production and the control measures applied in the Republic of Korea have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of organic production of processed agricultural products for use as food are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Consequently, the Republic of Korea should be included in the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 for processed agricultural products for use as food (Category D products).
(3) Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 contains a list of control bodies and control authorities competent to carry out controls and issue certificates in third countries for the purpose of equivalence. As a consequence of the inclusion of the Republic of Korea in Annex III to that Regulation, the relevant control bodies and control authorities recognised until now for the import of Category D products from the Republic of Korea should be deleted from Annex IV.
(4) Annexes III and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The inclusion of the Republic of Korea in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should apply from 1 February 2015. In order to allow operators to adapt to the amendments made to Annexes III and IV to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008, the amendment of the latter Annex should, however, apply only after a reasonable time period.

Activities and financial support\n\nThe activities undertaken in the scope of the Preparatory Action on ""The enhancement of the European industrial potential in the field of security research"" will be projects and supporting activities. The projects will normally have duration between one and two years and the supporting activities will have duration between six months and three years.\n\nProjects will be invited by calls for proposals. The financial contributions to projects shall be covered by a written agreement (called grant contract). Supporting activities can also be selected from calls for proposals, leading to grant contracts or calls for tenders, resulting in service contracts.\n\nCalls for proposals and calls for tenders will be published in the Official Journal of the Community.\n\nFor calls for proposals, the evaluation and negotiation procedures and the principles for IPR and grants contracts are described in sections 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 below. For the call for tenders standard procedures and contracts will be used.\n\nThe Commission may appoint independent experts to assist in the development of the European Security Research Programme; proposal evaluation; and monitoring of activities including the overall outcome of the Preparatory Action. Experts shall be appointed by a decision of the Commission authorising officer based on a call for applications.\n\n2. Participation\n\n2.1. General principles\n\nLegal entities established in the Member States(2) will be eligible to participate and receive a Community financial contribution. The participants will be public authorities, industrial organisations: public and private (including SMEs), higher education institutions and research organisations.\n\nIn exceptional cases and over and above the minimum number of participants, legal entities established in a third country or international organisations may participate. In such cases, a Community financial contribution may be exceptionally provided. Involvement from third countries will be subject to arrangements of a reciprocal nature with that country.\n\nAppropriate measures will be taken to ensure that classified information is treated in accordance with the Commission provisions on security(3). In addition, participants in a consortium shall ensure that the treatment of classified information complies with the security regulations applicable.\n\n2.2. Minimum number of participants\n\nProjects shall be carried out by a consortium composed of at least two independent legal entities from different Member States(4). It should be noted that collaborative working between different Member States entities, including public security organisations, is strongly encouraged and represents one key objective of this Preparatory Action.\n\nSupporting activities may be carried out by a single participant or by a consortium.\n\nConsortiums will be represented by a coordinator who will ensure coordination tasks and administer the Community contribution regarding its allocation between the participants.\n\n2.3. Technical competence and resources\n\nParticipants shall have the knowledge and technical competence needed to carry out the activity. As work progresses, participants shall have the resources as and when needed to carry out the activity. The resources needed to carry out the activity are understood to be human resources, infrastructure, financial resources and, if necessary, intangible property and other resources made available by a third party on the basis of a prior commitment.\n\n3. Evaluation of project proposals\n\n3.1. Evaluation and selection procedure\n\nThe proposals for projects submitted in response to a call for proposals will be evaluated according to the procedure described below. Classified documentation will be treated in accordance to the applicable rules on classified documents.\n\n3.2. Eligibility check\n\nThe Commission services will verify that proposals meet the following eligibility criteria:\n\n- receipt of proposal by the Commission on or before the deadline date and time established in the call;\n\n- minimum number of participants, as referred to in the call for proposals;\n\n- completeness of the proposal, i.e. presence of all requested administrative forms and the proposal description.\n\nOnly proposals that fulfil the eligibility criteria will be retained for evaluation.\n\n3.3. Evaluation criteria\n\nEach proposal will be assessed on the basis of the following criteria:\n\n- relevance of the proposal to the Programme of Work of the Preparatory Action;\n\n- reinforcement of the competitiveness for European industry and potential for exploitation;\n\n- scientific and/or technological excellence and contribution to tangible and demonstrable improvements in security;\n\n- building of effective partnerships between (public) users, industry and research;\n\n- ability of the consortium to carry out the project successfully and to ensure its efficient management, including the ability to protect classified information if necessary, and clear plans for the management of intellectual property.\n\n3.4. Scoring, thresholds and weighting of evaluation criteria\n\nEach evaluation criterion will be marked on a six-point scale from 0 to 5 indicating the following:\n\n0 - the proposal fails to address the issue under examination or can not be judged against the criterion due to missing or incomplete information.\n\n1 - poor; 2 - fair; 3 - good; 4 - very good; 5 - excellent.\n\nA minimum threshold of 3 will be set for all the criteria. Any proposal, which fails to achieve one of the threshold scores, will be rejected. A total score will be calculated for all the proposals, which pass all thresholds with all criteria weighted equally. A minimum threshold of 18/25 will be set for the total score.\n\n3.5. Description of proposals evaluation\n\nEach proposal will be evaluated by at least three evaluators (either Commission staff, or external experts, or both) working independently and without any conflict of interest. They will give marks and comments for each criterion.\n\nOnce all the evaluators to whom a proposal has been assigned have completed their individual assessment, a consensus discussion may be convened to discuss the marks awarded and agree on a consensus mark for each criterion.\n\nA panel of evaluators will carry out a final examination, consolidate the scores and agree on the consensus reports. The outcome of the panel meeting is a report containing for each proposal the scores and underpinning comments for each criterion, and a list of proposals passing thresholds, if any, along with a final mark for each proposal passing the thresholds and the panel recommendations for priority order.\n\n3.6. Feed back to proposers\n\nThe coordinator of each proposal will receive the evaluation report. For those proposals rejected after failing an evaluation threshold, the comments may only be complete for those criteria examined up to the point when the threshold was failed.\n\n4. Finalisation of the evaluation\n\n4.1. Commission ranked list\n\nThe Commission services will draw up a list of all the proposals evaluated which pass the required thresholds ranked in priority order based on the final score. If two proposals have the same final score, the Commission services will take into account the Preparatory Action objectives, the compatibility of the proposals with stated Community objectives and the available budget.\n\n4.2. Commission reserve list\n\nThe list of proposals to be retained for negotiation takes into account the budget available (which is set out in the call for proposals). If necessary, a number of proposals are kept in reserve to allow for the failure of negotiations, withdrawal of proposals and/or savings to be made during contract negotiation.\n\nThe coordinators of any proposals held in reserve receive confirmation that negotiations with a view to preparing a contract may be offered, but only if funding becomes available.\n\nWhen the budget for the call has been used up, any proposal remaining from the ""reserve"" which could not be funded will be rejected and the coordinators informed.\n\n4.3. Rejection decision\n\nThe proposals found to be ineligible, out of scope, failing any of the individual thresholds for evaluation criteria and those which, because they fall below a certain ranking cannot be funded for budgetary reasons will be rejected by a decision of the Commission authorising officer.\n\n5. Negotiation and selection procedure\n\nImmediately following the preparation of the final ranked list by the Commission services, the coordinators of proposals not to be rejected and for which funding is available will be invited to begin negotiations.\n\nNegotiation may cover any scientific, legal or financial aspects of the proposal, based on any issue raised during the evaluation or any other issue that was taken into consideration at the ranking stage.\n\nFuture contractors must be in compliance with the Financial Regulations(5). In addition, any potential contractor subject to a conflict of interest or having been found guilty of misrepresentation in supplying the information required as a condition for participation in the contract or failing to supply such information shall be excluded from participation in any future grant contract(6).\n\nIf it proves impossible to reach agreement with proposers within a reasonable deadline the Commission services may impose, negotiations on contract preparation may be terminated and the proposal rejected. The Commission services will negotiate proposals selected respecting the ranking decided for selection, up till the amount available in the financial decision.\n\nIf negotiations are successful, contracts for grants will be awarded.\n\n6. Reports and audit\n\nThe projects and supporting activities will regularly report to the Commission on in order to allow proper monitoring. In performing monitoring of activities, the Commission may be assisted by independent experts (appropriately cleared if necessary). The Commission, or any representative authorised by it, shall have the right to carry out scientific, technological and financial audits on the participants, in order to ensure that the activities are being or have been performed under the conditions claimed and in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\n7. Contract and intellectual property rights\n\n7.1. General principles\n\nThe grant contract for projects and supporting activities will be based on the 6th Framework programme model contract. The grant contract will be signed by the authorising officer of the Commission and all the participants of the consortium.\n\nSpecial clauses may be added concerning ownership of knowledge, protection of knowledge, use and confidentiality, and access rights in order to test the specificities that may arise in the activities in this Preparatory Action.\n\n7.2. Community financial contribution\n\nThe Community financial contribution shall take the form of a grant to the budget, calculated as a percentage of the budget established by the participants to carry out the project or supporting activity. The expenses needed to implement the project or the supporting activity shall be certified by an external auditor or, in the case of public bodies, a competent public officer.\n\nEligible expenses must meet the following conditions:\n\n1. They must be actual, economic and necessary for the implementation of the project or supporting activity;\n\n2. They must be determined in accordance with the usual accounting principles of the individual participant;\n\n3. They must be recorded in the accounts of the participants or, in the case of the resources of third parties in the corresponding financial documents of those third parties;\n\n4. They shall be exclusive of indirect taxes, duties and interest and may not give rise to profit.\n\n7.3. Financial schemes\n\nFor projects, two financial schemes are distinguished following the research categories as set out in of the Community framework for State-aid for research and development(7):\n\n1. Industrial Research\n\n2. Pre-competitive Development Activities.\n\nA third scheme is added for completeness:\n\n3. Management of the activities\n\nThe following table indicates the maximum rates of Community financial contribution for the projects in function of the schemes.\n\n>TABLE>\n\nWhere Community funding is combined with national funding in the form of State aid, total official support, according to the Community framework for State aid for research and development, may not exceed 75 % in the case of industrial research and 50 % in the case of pre-competitive development activities.\n\nThe grants allocated for supporting activities are not subject to State-aid rules and shall reimburse up to 75 % of the eligible costs, which may include up to 10 % of the total contribution for management activities.\n\n7.4. Intellectual property rights\n\nThe knowledge shall be the property of the contractors who generate it. Any transfer of knowledge created under a grant contract, or any granting of access rights to such knowledge to another organization outside the consortium need the approval of the Commission, the Member States in which the participants reside and the other contractors.\n\nThe Commission and Member States may refuse approval for reasons of major European or national interest or by applying their laws. Other participants may refuse approval if they can demonstrate that their commercial or industrial interests may be significantly impaired or that any legal obligations would be violated.\n\n(1) At the time of the publication of the calls for proposals, the Commission will issue a detailed vade-mecum for proposers.\n\n(2) Member States means all States of EU-25 including Accession Countries.\n\n(3) OJ L 317, 3.12.2001.\n\n(4) If the composition of project partners in an EEIG is comparable with these conditions, the EEIG shall also be eligible.\n\n(5) Financial Regulation Articles 114 and 93.\n\n(6) Financial Regulation Articles 114 and 94.\n\n(7) OJ C 45, 17.2.1996, p. 5.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 3, 9d(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for the authorisation of the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of the preservative preparation of sodium benzoate, propionic acid and sodium propionate for cattle for fattening. On 18 October 2006 the European Food Safety Authority delivered its opinion on the safety and efficacy of that preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.
(6) The use of the preparation of benzoic acid was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 877/2003 (3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that preparation for pigs for fattening. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation, as specified in Annex II to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.
(7) The assessment of these applications show that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (4).

The evolution of the active fishing fleet with the exception of:\n\n- aquaculture working vessels,\n\n- vessels engaged exclusively in molluscs,\n\nduring the period covered by the programme should be made within the following limits:\n\nTonnage\n\n(GRT)\n\n1.2.3.4,6 //  //  //  //  // Type  // Objective of programme at 31. 12. 1986   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987 (1)   // Objective at 1.2.3.4.5.6 //  //  //  // 31. 12. 1989   // 31. 12. 1990  // 31. 12. 1991   //    //   //   //   //   //   // Cutter fleet   // 52 100   // 68 200   //   //   // 51 574   // Deep water fleet   // 14 700   // 14 200   //   //   // 13 222   //   //   //   //   //   //   // Total A  // 66 800   // 82 400  // 80 640   // 71 840   // 64 796   //    //   //   //   //  //   // Vessels exclusively engaged in aquaculture in molluscs   //   // 13 500   //   //   //   //    //   //   //   //   //  // Total B  //  // 95 900   //   //   //   //    //   //   //  //   //\n\n(1) Including the vessels under construction at 1. 1. 1987.\n\nEngine power\n\n( kW)\n\n1.2.3.4,6 //  //  //  //  // Type  // Objective of programme at 31. 12. 1986   // Situation at 1. 1. 1987 (1)   // Objective at 1.2.3.4.5.6 //  //  //  // 31. 12. 1989   // 31. 12. 1990  // 31. 12. 1991   //    //   //   //   //   //   // Cutter fleet   // 338 560   // 440 000   //   //   // 336 000  // Deep water fleet   // 51 520   // 58 000   //   //   // 46 278   //    //   //   //   //   //   // Total A  // 390 080  // 498 800   // 486 430   // 429 570   // 382 278   //    //  //   //   //   //   // Vessels exclusively engaged in aquaculture in molluscs   //   // 39 043   //   //   //   //  //   //   //   //   //   // Total B  //  // 537 043   //   //  //   //    //   //   //   //   //\n\n(1) Including the vessels under construction at 1. 1. 1987. III. PLANNED MEASURES\n\n1.1. While the objectives in II. 2 ""Total A"" require a reduction in the fishing capacity equal to the difference between the situation at 1 January 1987 and the objective to be achieved by 31 December 1991, it is also necessary to take into account the balance of capacity resulting from:\n\n- the balance of exits and entries from the fleet between the situation fixed for 1 January 1987 and 30 June 1988,\n\nwhich additions give the total reduction in fishing fleet capacity required.\n\n1.2. The reductions envisaged in III. 1.1 should be achieved by implementing the following actions in so far as the entry into service of surplus fishing capacity having been incorporated in the capacity limits of this programme (1) and being intended that the reductions envisaged for each of the actions can be varied on condition that the total volume of reduction of fishing capacity set out above in III. 1.1 is respected:\n\n- a reduction in the total fleet, by renewal of those active vessels lost by accident at sea, sinking or otherwise by linking direct withdrawals to new constructions in line with a reduction towards the achievement of the objectives for fleet capacity fixed in II. 2,\n\n- the adoption and implementation of measures intended to adjust the fishing capacity and for which is granted permanent cessation premiums to achieve that reduction particularly which cannot be achieved by the measures in the preceding line,\n\n- the adoption of administrative measures which enable the elimination of possible increase of fishing capacity contrary to the objectives of the programme,\n\n- any other measures that will achieve the same results, inter alia the limitation of the number of days at sea.\n\n2. Adoption and implementation of comprehensive legislation and/or administrative measures in order to control effectively the active fishing capacity with a view to achieving the objectives of the programme.\n\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels in order to effectively control fishing capacity.\n\nIV. COMMENTS\n\n1. The objectives of the fleet given in II. 1 (a) can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n\n2. In the case of fishing vessels operating in the coastal zone and smaller than 12 metres, a limited increase in tonnage (maximum 10 % GRT) and horsepower maximum 6 % kW) can be taken into consideration in order to improve safety, working conditions and preservation of catch on board on condition that these increases are fully justified and that the objectives for the vessels category to which these vessels belong and which are fixed in II. 2 of this Decision are respected. Any such increase, on checking, cannot interfere with the balance of the resources likely to be exploited by these vessels.\n\n3. The objectives of the programme should be realized up to the 10 % level at least by the end of 1989 and to the 60 % level at least by the end of 1990.\n\n4. The Commission recalls that all structural aids sanctioned by national, regional or local authorities on the fisheries sector and including aids for shipyards for the construction of fishing vessels should be included within the framework of the present programme.\''}]}"

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1277/84 of 8 May 1984 laying down general rules for the system of production aid for processed fruit and vegetables (5) contains provisions as to the methods for determining the production aid;
Whereas, under Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, the minimum price to be paid to producers is to be determined on the basis of, firstly, the minimum price applying during the previous marketing year, secondly, the movement of basic prices in the fruit and vegetable sector and, thirdly, the need to ensure the normal marketing of fresh products for the various uses;
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the minimum price to be paid to producers, the non-member country price and, if necessary, the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis; whereas, in respect of tomato concentrates, preserved whole peeled tomatoes and tomato juices the volume of imports makes the non-member country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid for these products must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price;
Whereas Article 1 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 989/84 (6) fixed as the guarantee threshold for each year a quantity of processed tomato products corresponding to 4 700 000 tonnes of fresh tomatoes; whereas Community production calculated in accordance with Article 2 (2) of that Regulation exceeds the threshold for the 1985/86 marketing year and the production of each group of tomato-based products is higher than the quantity specified in the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of the same Regulation; whereas the production aid for the 1986/87 marketing year must be reduced for such products pursuant to Article 2 (1) of the same Regulation;
Whereas, as regards Greece, pursuant to Article 103 of the Act of Accession of Greece and until the first move towards alignment of prices, the minimum price to be paid to Greek producers is to be established on the basis of prices paid in Greece to national producers, over the reference period defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 41/81 (7); whereas that price must be aligned with the level of the common prices pursuant to Article 59 of that Act;
Whereas, as regards Greece, the said Article 103 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 990/84 (8) lay down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid;
Whereas the minimum price to be paid to producers in Spain and Portugal and the production aid for the products obtained shall be determined as provided for in Articles 118 and 304 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas the representative period for determining the minimum price for tomatoes intended for certain uses is laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 461/86 of 25 February laying down, on account of the accession of Spain and Portugal, rules on the production aid system in respect of processed fruit and vegetables (9); whereas as a consequence of Article 1 (2) of that Regulation no production aid can be paid during the transitional period for preserved whole peeled tomatoes and frozen whole tomatoes obtained from the San Marzano variety grown in Portugal;
Whereas Articles 118 (3) (b) and 304 (3) (b) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal provide that the grant of production aid to tomato-based products is to be limited to specific quantities; whereas to ensure equitable allocation of raw material to each of the production regions of the Community, it should be laid down that tomatoes grown in a specific region only attract production aid when processed in that region;
Whereas Article 4 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1709/84 (1) provides that, inter alia, during the 1986/87 marketing year the production aid to be paid for tomato concentrate packed in containers with a weight, including immediate packing, of less than 1,5 kilograms is to be increased by a percentage; whereas this increase is based on the processing cost involved in the packing; whereas these costs are considered as identical in all Member States; whereas the increase should also be identical in all Member States; whereas to that end specific percentages should be fixed for Spain, Portugal and Greece;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride,1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromo-chloromethane.
(2) Each year the Commission has to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.
(3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.
(4) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the sixth Meeting of the Parties, Decision VII/11 and Decision XI/15 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.
(5) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the 12th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom have notified the United Nations Environment Programme (2) that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of specific short-acting beta agonist CFC-MDIs. Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have reduced the demand for CFCs in the Community. In addition, Article 4(6) prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).
(6) The Commission published a notice (3) on 11 July 2003 to those companies in the Community (15) that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2004 and a further notification to companies in the 10 new Member States on 11 May 2004 (4), and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances in 2004.
(7) Commission Decision 2004/209/EC of 28 January 2004 on the allocation of quantities of controlled substances allowed for essential uses in the Community in 2004 pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) should be amended in order to take account of the inclusion of specific quantities of ozone depleting substances required for essential uses in the 10 new Member States from 1 May 2004.
(8) In the interests of legal clarity and transparency Decision 2004/209/EC should therefore be replaced.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,","{'header': '2.3.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 56/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 23 February 2005\non the allocation of quantities of controlled substances allowed for essential uses in the Community in 2004 under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document number C(2005) 293)\n(Only the Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovenian and Spanish texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/171/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride,1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromo-chloromethane.\n\n((2)) Each year the Commission has to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.\n\n((3)) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.\n\n((4)) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the sixth Meeting of the Parties, Decision VII/11 and Decision XI/15 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.\n\n((5)) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the 12th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom have notified the United Nations Environment Programme(2)that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of specific short-acting beta agonist CFC-MDIs.

(1) Pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) the Commission is, subject to confirmation of its feasibility, to review the modalities of achieving the 147 g CO2/km target by 2020, including the formulae set out in Annex I to that Regulation and the derogations provided for in Article 11 thereof. It is appropriate that this Regulation be as neutral as possible from the point of view of competition, socially equitable and sustainable.
(2) In view of the link between CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, defining modalities for reducing CO2 emissions from light commercial vehicles could also contribute to reducing fuel consumption and related costs for owners of such vehicles in a cost-effective manner.
(3) It is appropriate to clarify that, for the purpose of verifying compliance with the target of 147 g CO2/km, CO2 emissions should continue to be measured in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and its implementing measures, and innovative technologies.
(4) According to the technical analysis carried out for the impact assessment, the technologies needed to meet the target of 147 g CO2/km are available and the required reductions can be achieved at a lower cost than estimated in the previous technical analysis carried out prior to the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. In addition, the distance between the current average specific emissions of CO2 from new light commercial vehicles and the target of 147 g CO2/km has also decreased. Therefore, the feasibility of reaching that target by 2020 has been confirmed.
(5) In recognition of the disproportionate impact on the smallest manufacturers resulting from compliance with the specific emissions targets defined on the basis of the utility of the vehicle, the high administrative burden of the derogation procedure, and the marginal resulting benefit in terms of CO2 emissions reduction from the vehicles sold by those manufacturers, manufacturers responsible for fewer than 1 000 new light commercial vehicles registered in the Union annually should be excluded from the scope of the specific emissions target and the excess emissions premium.
(6) The procedure for granting a derogation to small-volume manufacturers should be simplified to allow for more flexibility in terms of when an application for a derogation is to be submitted by such manufacturers and when the Commission is to grant such a derogation.
(7) To enable the automotive industry to engage in long-term investment and innovation, it is desirable to provide indications as to how Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 should be amended for the period beyond 2020. Those indications should be based on an assessment of the necessary rate of reduction in line with the Union’s long-term climate goals and the implications for the development of cost effective CO2-reducing technology for light commercial vehicles. The Commission should, by 2015, review such aspects and submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on its findings. That report should include, where appropriate, proposals for amending Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 in relation to establishing CO2 emission targets for new light commercial vehicles beyond 2020, including the possible setting of a realistic and achievable target for 2025, based on a comprehensive impact assessment that would consider the continued competitiveness of the industry and its dependent industries, while pursuing a clear emissions reduction trajectory in line with the Union’s long-term climate goals. When developing such proposals, the Commission should ensure they are as neutral as possible from the point of view of competition and are socially equitable and sustainable.
(8) Greenhouse gas emissions related to energy supply and vehicle manufacturing and disposal are significant components of the current overall road transport carbon footprint and are likely to significantly increase in importance in the future. Policy action should therefore be taken to guide manufacturers towards optimal solutions taking account of, in particular, greenhouse gas emissions associated with the generation of energy supplied to vehicles such as electricity and alternative fuels and to ensure that those upstream emissions do not erode the benefits related to the improved operational energy use of vehicles aimed for under Regulation (EU) No 510/2011.
(9) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, the Commission is required to publish a report on the availability of data on footprint and payload and their use as utility parameters for determining specific CO2 emissions targets as expressed by the formulae set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. Although those data are available and their potential use has been assessed in the impact assessment, it has been concluded that it is more cost-effective to retain mass in running order as the utility parameter for the 2020 target for light commercial vehicles.
(10) It is appropriate to retain the approach of setting the target based on a linear relationship between the utility of the light commercial vehicle and its target CO2 emissions as expressed by the formulae set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, since this allows the diversity of the light commercial vehicle market, and the ability of manufacturers to address different consumer needs, to be maintained, thus avoiding any unjustified distortion of competition. It is however appropriate to update that approach to reflect the latest available data on registrations of new light commercial vehicles.
(11) In its impact assessment, the Commission assessed the availability of footprint data and the use of footprint as the utility parameter in the formulae set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. On the basis of that assessment, the Commission has concluded that the utility parameter used in the formula for 2020 should be mass.
(12) Under Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) the Commission is required to carry out an impact assessment in order to review the test procedures with a view to reflecting adequately the real CO2 emissions behaviour of cars. Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 extends the review of the test procedures to include light commercial vehicles. There is a need to amend the currently used ‘New European Driving Cycle’ (NEDC), to ensure its representativeness regarding real driving conditions and to avoid the underestimation of real CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. A new, more realistic and reliable test procedure should be agreed as soon as feasible. Work in this direction is proceeding through the development of a Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP) in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe but has not yet been completed. In order to ensure that specific CO2 emissions quoted for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles are brought more closely into line with the emissions actually generated during normal conditions of use, the WLTP should be applied at the earliest opportunity. In view of that context, Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 establishes emission limits for 2020 as measured in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and Annex XII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (6). When the test procedures are amended, the limits set in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 should be adjusted to ensure comparable stringency for manufacturers and classes of vehicles. Accordingly, the Commission should carry out a robust correlation study between the NEDC and the new WLTP test cycles to ensure its representativeness regarding real driving conditions.
(13) With a view to ensuring that real world emissions are adequately reflected, and measured CO2 values are strictly comparable, the Commission should ensure that those elements in the testing procedure that have a significant influence on measured CO2 emissions are strictly defined in order to prevent the utilisation of test cycle flexibilities by manufacturers. The deviations between type-approval CO2 emission values and emissions derived from vehicles offered for sale should be addressed, including by considering an in-service conformity test procedure that should ensure independent testing of a representative sample of vehicles for sale, as well as ways of addressing cases of demonstrated substantial divergence between survey and initial type-approval CO2 emissions.
(14) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to define the modalities for reaching the 2020 target to reduce CO2 emissions from new light commercial vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(15) Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '20.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 84/38', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 253/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\namending Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 to define the modalities for reaching the 2020 target to reduce CO2emissions from new light commercial vehicles\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)the Commission is, subject to confirmation of its feasibility, to review the modalities of achieving the 147\xa0g CO2/km target by 2020, including the formulae set out in Annex I to that Regulation and the derogations provided for in Article 11 thereof.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000(2), and in particular Article 12(5)(a)(iii) and Article 248 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Common Customs Code(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(4) and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature (CN) annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(5), the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 1223/2002(6) clarifying and confirming the classification of the products described below as frozen poultrymeat of heading 0207, under CN subheading 0207 14 10: ""Boneless chicken cuts, frozen and impregnated with salt in all parts. They have a salt content by weight of 1,2 % to 1,9 %. The product is deep-frozen and has to be stored at a temperature of lower than -18 Â°C to ensure conservation for at least one year"".
(2) This classification was adopted for the following reasons: ""Classification is determined by the provisions of General Rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 0207, 0207 14 and 0207 14 10. The product is chicken meat frozen for long-term conservation. The addition of salt does not alter the character of the product as frozen meat of heading 0207"".
(3) Following publication of the above Regulation on 9 July 2002(7), all binding tariff information (BTIs) previously issued by Member States classifying the products concerned as salted meat of heading 0210 ceased to be valid.
(4) Based on this Regulation, some Member States later issued BTIs for frozen products of the same kind containing 2 % to 2,7 % salt under heading 0207.
(5) A number of cases subsequently came to light in which Germany had issued BTIs classifying frozen products of this kind containing between 1,9 % and 3 % by weight of salt under heading 0210.
(6) In so doing, Germany failed to take account of the fact that the classification regulation constitutes the application of a general rule to a particular case, and thus contains guidance on the interpretation of the rule which can be applied by the authority responsible for the classification of an identical or similar product.
(7) Products also consisting of boneless chicken cuts which have been frozen for long-term conservation and have a salt content of 1,9 % to 3 % are similar to the products covered by Regulation (EC) No 1223/2002. The addition of salt in such quantities is not such as to alter the products' character as frozen poultry meat of heading 0207.
(8) In order to safeguard equality between operators, which would be endangered if like cases were not treated alike, and to ensure uniform application of the CN, the BTIs issued by Germany on frozen poultry meat containing between 1,9 % and 3 % salt, listed in the annex, must be withdrawn.
(9) Pursuant to Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2454/93, the holder of the BTIs concerned may make use of the possibility of invoking BTIs which have ceased to be valid during a given period.

Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 1981/94 (3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1667/97 (4), opens and provides for the administration of Community tariff quotas for fresh cut flowers and flower buds originating in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Malta, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1) and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for a Community financial contribution for the undertaking of technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for veterinary education and training.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare in a report of 27 June 2000 recommended that surveys be carried out on poultry flocks and wild birds for avian influenza, in particular to determine the prevalence of infections with avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7.
(3) Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza (2) defines Community control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry. However, it does not provide for regular surveys of that disease in poultry and wild birds.
(4) Accordingly, Commission Decisions 2002/649/EC (3) and 2004/111/EC (4) provided for the submission of surveillance programmes concerning avian influenza by the Member States to the Commission.
(5) Commission Decisions 2002/673/EC (5) and 2004/630/EC (6) approved programmes submitted by the Member States for surveys of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds for the periods specified in those programmes.
(6) During those surveys, the presence of different subtypes of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses has been detected in several Member States. Although the current prevalence of avian influenza viruses can be considered rather low, it is important to continue and to improve the surveillance so as to better understand the epidemiology of the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and prevent that viruses do not circulate unnoticed in the poultry population. The results of the surveys carried out in the Member States have proven to be very useful in monitoring the presence of avian influenza virus subtypes that could present a substantial risk if they mutated into a more virulent form. Taking into account the results obtained and the current disease situation in the Community, it is appropriate to increase the total amount of Community contribution to ensure increased surveillance.

However, it does not provide for regular surveys of that disease in poultry and wild birds.\n\n((4)) Accordingly, Commission Decisions 2002/649/EC(3)and 2004/111/EC(4)provided for the submission of surveillance programmes concerning avian influenza by the Member States to the Commission.\n\n((5)) Commission Decisions 2002/673/EC(5)and 2004/630/EC(6)approved programmes submitted by the Member States for surveys of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds for the periods specified in those programmes.\n\n((6)) During those surveys, the presence of different subtypes of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses has been detected in several Member States. Although the current prevalence of avian influenza viruses can be considered rather low, it is important to continue and to improve the surveillance so as to better understand the epidemiology of the low pathogenic avian influenza viruses and prevent that viruses do not circulate unnoticed in the poultry population. The results of the surveys carried out in the Member States have proven to be very useful in monitoring the presence of avian influenza virus subtypes that could present a substantial risk if they mutated into a more virulent form. Taking into account the results obtained and the current disease situation in the Community, it is appropriate to increase the total amount of Community contribution to ensure increased surveillance.\n\n((7)) Accordingly, Member States should submit their programmes for surveys for avian influenza to the Commission for approval so that the financial assistance by the Community may be granted.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nBy 30 June 2005, Member States shall submit for approval to the Commission programmes for the implementation of surveys for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds in accordance with the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe Community’s financial contribution towards the measures provided for in Article 1 shall be at the rate of 50\xa0% of the costs incurred in Member States up to a maximum of EUR\xa01\xa0200\xa0000 for the Member States in total.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThe maximum amounts of the testing costs to be reimbursed shall not exceed:\n(a)\nELISA test\n:\nEUR 1 per test;\n(b)\nagar gel immune diffusion test\n:\nEUR 0,6 per test;\n(c)\nHI test for H5/H7\n:\nEUR 4 per test;\n(d)\nvirus isolation test\n:\nEUR 30 per test.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nProgrammes for surveillance of avian influenza in poultry and wild birds to be carried out in the Member States in 2005 and 2006\nA.\xa0\xa0\xa0OBJECTIVES\n1.\nTo estimate the prevalence of infections with avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7 in different species of poultry by repeating previous screening exercises provided for in Decisions 2004/111/EC and 2004/630/EC in a modified, more targeted manner.\n2.\nTo continue surveillance for avian influenza on a voluntary basis in wild birds.

For example, in many Member States a large slaughter of poultry (in particular turkeys and geese) takes place around Christmas. Sampling shall not extend beyond 31 January 2006.\n2.\n31 March 2006 shall be the date for the submission of the final survey results.\n3.\nTesting of samples shall be carried out at national laboratories for avian influenza (NL) in Member States or by other laboratories authorised by the competent authorities and under the control of the NL.\n4.\nAll results (both serological and virological) shall be sent to the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for collation. A good flow of information must be ensured. The CRL shall provide technical support and keep an enlarged stock of diagnostic reagents. Antigens for use in the survey shall be supplied to NL’s by the CRL to ensure uniformity.\n5.\nAll avian influenza (AI) virus isolates shall be submitted to the CRL in accordance with Community legislation. Viruses of H5/H7 subtype shall be submitted without delay and shall be subjected to the standard characterisation tests (nucleotide sequencing/IVPI) according to Directive 92/40/EEC. In addition, the CRL shall require that H5 or H7 positive sera collected from anseriformes be submitted ‘blind’ in order that an archive be established to facilitate future test development.\n6.\nAll positive findings shall be retrospectively investigated at the holding and the conclusions of this investigation shall be reported to the Commission and the CRL.\n7.\nSpecific protocols to accompany the sending of material to the CRL and reporting tables for collection of survey data shall be provided by the CRL. In those tables the laboratory testing methods used shall be indicated. The tables provided shall be used to submit results in a single document.\n8.\nBlood samples for serological examination shall be collected from all species of poultry including those reared in free-range systems, from at least 5 to 10 birds (except ducks geese and quail) per holding, and from the different sheds, if more than one shed is present on a holding.\n9.\nSampling shall be stratified throughout the territory of the whole Member State, so that samples can be considered as representative for the whole of the Member State, taking into account:\n(a)\nthe number of holdings to be sampled (excluding ducks, geese and turkeys); that number shall be defined so as to ensure the identification of at least one infected holding if the prevalence of infected holdings is at least 5\xa0%, with a\xa095 % confidence interval; (see table 1) and\n(b)\nthe number of birds sampled from each holding shall be defined so as to ensure 95\xa0% probability of identifying at least one positive bird if the prevalence of sero-positive birds is ≥\xa030\xa0%.\n10.\nThe sampling design shall also consider:\n(a)\nThe types of production and their specific risks, shall be targeted to free range production and outdoor keeping plus taking into account other factors such as multi-age, use of surface water, a relatively longer life span, the presence of more than one species on the holding or other relevant factors.\n(b)\nThe number of turkey, duck and goose holdings to be sampled shall be defined to ensure the identification of at least one infected holding if the prevalence of infected holdings is at least 5\xa0%, with a 99\xa0% confidence interval (see table 2).\n(c)\nWhere significant number of holdings producing ratites and quails are present in a Member State they shall be included in the programme. With regard to quails only adult (or laying) breeders shall be sampled.\n(d)\nThe time period for sampling shall coincide with seasonal production. However, where appropriate, sampling can be adapted to other identified periods at local level, during which time the presence of other poultry hosts on a holding might pose a greater risk for disease introduction.\n(e)\nMember States that must carry out sampling for Newcastle disease to maintain their status as Newcastle disease non-vaccinating countries in accordance with Commission Decision 94/327/EC\n(\n1\n)\nmay utilise these samples from breeding flocks for the surveillance of H5/H7 antibodies.\nTable 1\nNumber of holdings to be sampled of each poultry category (except turkey, duck and goose holdings)\nNumber of holdings per poultry category per Member State\nNumber of holdings to be sampled\nUp to 34\nAll\n35-50\n35\n51-80\n42\n81-250\n53\n> 250\n60\nTable 2\nNumber of turkey, duck and goose holdings to be sampled\nNumber of holdings per Member State\nNumber of holdings to be sampled\nUp to 46\nAll\n47-60\n47\n61-100\n59\n101-350\n80\n> 350\n90\nC.\xa0\xa0\xa0SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR DETECTION OF INFECTIONS WITH H5/H7 SUBTYPES OF AVIAN INFLUENZA IN DUCKS, GOOSE AND QUAIL\n1.\nBlood samples for serological testing shall be taken preferably from birds which are kept outside in fields.\n2.\nFrom each selected holding 40 to 50 blood samples shall be taken for serological testing.\nD.\xa0\xa0\xa0SURVEY FOR AVIAN INFLUENZA IN WILD BIRDS\nIn those Member States where surveillance will also concern wild birds the following guidelines shall be followed.\nD.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Survey design and implementation\n1.\nLiaisons with bird conservation/watching institutions and ringing stations are necessary. Sampling where appropriate shall be carried out by staff from these groups/stations or by hunters.\n2.\nExperience with the previous surveys has shown that the virus isolation rate was extremely low, therefore sampling shall focus on the birds migrating south during autumn and early winter.\nD.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Sampling procedures\n1.\nCloacal swabs for virological examination shall be taken. In addition to ‘first year’ birds in autumn, host species with high susceptibility and increased contact with poultry (such as Mallard ducks) may offer the highest chance of success.\n2.\nSamples shall be taken from different species of free living birds. Waterfowl and shorebirds shall be the main sampling targets.\n3.\nSwabs containing faeces, or carefully collected fresh faeces shall be taken from wild birds trapped, hunted and found freshly dead.\n4.\nPooling of up to five samples from the same species is possible. Specific care has to be taken for the storage and transport of samples. If rapid transport within 48 hours to the laboratory (in transport medium at 4°\xa0Celsius) is not guaranteed, samples shall be stored and then transported in dry ice at –\xa070°\xa0Celsius.\nE.\xa0\xa0\xa0LABORATORY TESTING\nLaboratory tests shall be carried out in accordance with the diagnostic procedures for the confirmation and differential diagnostic of avian influenza (AI) set out in Annex III to Directive 92/40/EEC (including examination of sera from ducks and geese by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. However, if laboratory tests not laid down in Directive 92/40/EEC, nor described in the OIE Terrestrial Manual, are envisaged, Member States shall provide the necessary validation data to the CRL, in parallel to submitting their programme to the Commission for approval.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) Good and transparent corporate governance is essential for enhancing competitiveness and efficiency of businesses in the European Union as well as strengthening shareholders rights and third parties protection.
(2) The Commission set up in September 2001 a high level group of company law experts to make recommendations on a modern regulatory framework for company law; the mandate of the high level group of company law experts was further extended to deal specifically with a number of corporate governance issues.
(3) Following the presentation of the final report of the high level group of experts on company law on 4 November 2002, the Council invited the Commission to develop an Action Plan for company law and corporate governance; such an Action Plan should be in particular a considered response to recent corporate failures.
(4) The Commission Action Plan on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union (1), adopted in May 2003 identified a series of actions that are required in order to modernise and simplify the regulatory framework, including the creation of the European Corporate Governance Forum.
(5) On 22 September 2003 the Council welcomed the presentation of the Action Plan which it considered to be an important element of establishing a transparent and sound capital market in an enlarged Union; the Council endorsed the Commission’s recognition of the importance of expert and public consultation as an integral part of the development of company law and corporate governance at European level and took note of the Commission’s intention to set up a Forum on systems of corporate governance within the European Union.
(6) The European Corporate Governance Forum should serve as a body for exchange of information and best practices existing in Member States in order to enhance the convergence of national codes of corporate governance as well as a body for reflection, debate and advice to the Commission in the field of corporate governance.
(7) The European Corporate Governance Forum should draw up its own rules of procedure and fully respect the role and the prerogatives of the institutions (2),","{'header': '22.10.2004 | EN XM | Official Journal of the European Union | L 321/53', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 15 October 2004\nestablishing the European Corporate Governance Forum\n(2004/706/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Good and transparent corporate governance is essential for enhancing competitiveness and efficiency of businesses in the European Union as well as strengthening shareholders rights and third parties protection.\n\n((2)) The Commission set up in September 2001 a high level group of company law experts to make recommendations on a modern regulatory framework for company law; the mandate of the high level group of company law experts was further extended to deal specifically with a number of corporate governance issues.\n\n((3)) Following the presentation of the final report of the high level group of experts on company law on 4 November 2002, the Council invited the Commission to develop an Action Plan for company law and corporate governance; such an Action Plan should be in particular a considered response to recent corporate failures.\n\n((4)) The Commission Action Plan on modernising company law and enhancing corporate governance in the European Union(1), adopted in May 2003 identified a series of actions that are required in order to modernise and simplify the regulatory framework, including the creation of the European Corporate Governance Forum.\n\n((5)) On 22 September 2003 the Council welcomed the presentation of the Action Plan which it considered to be an important element of establishing a transparent and sound capital market in an enlarged Union; the Council endorsed the Commission’s recognition of the importance of expert and public consultation as an integral part of the development of company law and corporate governance at European level and took note of the Commission’s intention to set up a Forum on systems of corporate governance within the European Union.\n\n((6)) The European Corporate Governance Forum should serve as a body for exchange of information and best practices existing in Member States in order to enhance the convergence of national codes of corporate governance as well as a body for reflection, debate and advice to the Commission in the field of corporate governance.\n\n((7)) The European Corporate Governance Forum should draw up its own rules of procedure and fully respect the role and the prerogatives of the institutions(2),', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAn expert group on corporate governance in the Community, called the ‘European Corporate Governance Forum’ (hereinafter referred to as the Forum) is hereby established.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe role of the Forum shall be, in the light of developing corporate governance practices in the Member States, to enhance the convergence of national codes of corporate governance and to provide strategic advice to the Commission, either at the Commission’s request or on its own initiative, on policy issues in the field of corporate governance.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThe Forum shall comprise 15 members at most whose experience and competence regarding corporate governance are widely recognised at Community level.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136), as a feed additive for ducks, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed. The method of analysis referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is therefore not to be understood as a Community method of analysis within the meaning of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(5) The use of endo-1,4-beta xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136) was authorised without a time limit for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005 (3) and for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004 (4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 15 June 2006 (5) that the safety of this additive for the consumer, the user and the environment have already been established and will not be changed by the proposed new use. It further concluded, that the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on this additional animal category and that the use of that preparation can improve the zootechnical parameters in ducks. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas the principles underlying the organization of documentary, identity and physical checks, as well as the follow-up to such checks have been laid down; whereas it is now necessary to adopt additional measures in order to establish a reliable  harmonized procedure and set up the new arrangements for veterinary checks on products from third countries;
Whereas documentary and identity checks are based on a comparison between the information transmitted by the importer and the products imported into the Community and must be carried out according to certain rules; whereas physical checks on such  products must also meet certain requirements, and the type and results of checks must be mentioned on a certificate;
Whereas, therefore, the proper functioning of the new arrangements requires that all information on a product be brought together in a document based on a given model;
Whereas the routing of products which may be accepted only for uses other than human consumption should be carried out within the framework of an appropriate existing Community procedure;
Whereas certain veterinary checks are not carried out on products carried in the luggage of travellers and intended for their consumption, or sent in small consignments addressed to individuals; whereas a maximum weight limit should nevertheless be  fixed for products subject to such derogations;
Whereas certain plant products posing a risk of spreading contagious diseases to animals must be subjected to veterinary checks; whereas a list of such products must be drawn up, together with a list of third countries or parts of third countries which  may be authorized to export them to the Community;
Whereas certain consignments of products exported from a Member State towards a third country may be refused importation by the third country, then in those cases it is up to the competent authority of the Member State that has exported the products to  take the necessary measures to control the consignment on its re-introduction into the territory of the Community;
Whereas in accordance with Article 11 (2) (b) of Directive 90/675/EEC, the Member State is able to conclude bilateral agreements for certain veterinary controls in the country of destination, it is required in these cases to ensure all necessary  measures in the way of veterinary checks as mentioned in this Directive are carried out;
Whereas the products stored in a free zone or in a free warehouse, in a warehouse under customs control or in transit through the territory of the Community from one third country to another will be made the subject of a further implementing Decision;
Whereas derogations concerning the inspection of fish coming from third countries into the Community will be made the subject of later implementing Decisions;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, hereinafter referred to as 'the Act', and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 303 thereof,

Whereas, pursuant to the first and second subparagraphs of Article 303 of the Act, the maximum quantities of raw sugar to be imported at a reduced levy from certain ACP States, together with the relevant periods of application in order to supply the  Portuguese refineries, have been determined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 600/86 (3);
Whereas the third subparagraph of Article 303 of the Act provides in particular that, where, during the specified periods of application, the Community forward estimate for raw sugar for a given marketing year or part thereof shows that the availability  of raw sugar is insufficient to ensure adequate supply of Portuguese refineries, Portugal may be authorized to import from third countries under the marketing year or part thereof concerned, the quantities which it is estimated are lacking, under the  same conditions regarding the reduced levy as those provided for in respect of the quantities to be imported from the ACP States in question; whereas the forward estimate, for the period from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1992, of Community raw sugar available  for refining does not at this stage enable the quantities that the Portuguese refineries are lacking to be determined with any accuracy; whereas to ensure adequate supplies in these circumstances there should be fixed as a first step a quantity to be  imported from third countries at a reduced levy for a specified period enabling the actual availabilities of Community raw sugar, particularly as regards the production of the French overseas department of RĂŠunion, to be known accurately and therefore  to be able to fix as a second step the final quantities lacking;
Whereas, in order to ensure sound management of the markets in the sector and, in particular, effective control of operations, it is necessary firstly to apply to the sugar concerned the normal rules for performance of the customs formalities for import  and, secondly, to provide for notification by Portugal of the quantities of raw sugar imported and refined within the meaning of this Decision;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 227 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 227 (2) of the Treaty, the common organization of the market in rice applies to the French overseas departments ; whereas import levies are considered as own resources of the Community;
Whereas no rice is cultivated in the overseas department of Reunion ; whereas this department is therefore completely dependent on imports;
Whereas rice constitutes the basic foodstuff of the least favoured categories of the population of Reunion ; whereas per capita consumption considerably exceeds that of the Community ; whereas the supply situation should be improved by the introduction of special arrangements for rice for local consumption;
Whereas import levies should therefore no longer be applied in the overseas department of Reunion;
Whereas the threshold price for milled rice includes a component for the protection of the industry which is currently fixed at 11 750 units of account per tonne ; whereas, in order to continue to protect the industry established in Reunion, a levy equal to the amount of this protection component should be maintained;
Whereas rice imported into Reunion comes not only from third countries but also from Member States ; whereas, in the interests of equal treatment and Community preference, rice from the Member States should enjoy an advantage corresponding to that accorded to rice from third countries ; whereas this must imply a subsidy equal to the amount of the levy;
Whereas the expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of their obligations under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (2), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1158/77 (3), are financed by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2788/72 (5) ; whereas provision should therefore be made for the Community to finance the subsidy for rice from the Member States,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 594/78 of 20 March 1978 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 on the common organization of the market in rice with respect to the French overseas department of Reunion', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following Article shall be added to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76:\n\n""Article 11a 1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84 of 14 August 1984 on special detailed rules for the application of export refunds in the case of certain preserved beef and veal products (2) lays down the conditions under which preserved meat falling within CN codes 1602 50 31 and 1602 50 39 which is exported to third countries may be eligible for a special refund.
(2) In particular, those preserved products must be manufactured under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (3).
(3) The rules and conditions for applying the advance payment of the refund on products processed under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 are laid down in Chapter 3 of Title II of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (4).
(4) The measures laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 565/80, the corresponding implementing measures laid down by Chapter 3 of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 and Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84 have been repealed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1713/2006.
(5) It is also laid down that, in order to benefit from an export refund, the abovementioned preserved products must be produced from beef and veal of Community origin and contain a minimum percentage of beef and veal, excluding offal and fat.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 19 January 2010
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Belgium
(2010/283/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, Article 126(6) in conjunction with Article 126(13) and Article 136 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Belgium,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 also establishes provisions for the implementation of Article 104 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, required the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considered that an excessive deficit in a Member State existed or might occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit existed in Belgium. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Belgium on 11 November 2009 (3).
(6) Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Belgium, this overall assessment leads to the conclusions set out in this Decision.
(7) According to data notified by the Belgian authorities in October 2009, the general government deficit in Belgium is planned to reach 5,9 % of GDP in 2009, thus exceeding and not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value. The planned excess over the reference value can be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it results, among other things, from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In the Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast, GDP is projected to decrease by 2,9 % in 2009 and to expand by 0,6 % in 2010. Furthermore, also on the basis of the autumn 2009 forecast, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the deficit is expected to stabilise at 5,8 % of GDP in 2010 and 2011, taking into account the already sufficiently specified consolidation measures. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) General government gross debt has been continuously declining from 134 % of GDP in 1993 to 84 % of GDP in 2007. In 2008, the operations to stabilise the financial sector led to an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to almost 90 %. Hence, the ratio remained well above the 60 % reference value. According to data notified by the Belgian authorities in October 2009, the general government gross debt is planned to stand at 97,6 % of GDP in 2009. The Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast projects the debt ratio to increase to around 97 % in 2009, 101 % in 2010 and 104 % in 2011. The debt ratio cannot be considered as diminishing sufficiently and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The debt criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(9) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Belgium, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '21.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/34', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 19 January 2010\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Belgium\n(2010/283/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

DIRECTIVE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 18 December 2006
amending Directive 2006/87/EC laying down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels
(2006/137/EC)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee,
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2006/87/EC (2) establishes harmonised conditions for issuing technical certificates for inland waterway vessels throughout the Community's inland waterway network.
(2) The technical requirements set out in the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC for the most part incorporate the provisions laid down in the Regulation on Inspection of Shipping on the Rhine, in the version approved in 2004 by the member states of the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine (CCNR). The conditions and technical requirements for issuing inland navigation certificates under Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation are updated regularly and are recognised as reflecting current technological developments.
(3) In order to prevent distortions of competition and varying levels of safety, it is desirable, specifically in the interests of promoting harmonisation at European level, to adopt equivalent technical requirements for the whole of the Community's inland waterway network and, subsequently, to update them at regular intervals in order to maintain that equivalence.
(4) Directive 2006/87/EC authorises the Commission to adapt those technical requirements in the light of technical progress and of developments arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular that of the CCNR.
(5) Those amendments need to be made rapidly in order to ensure that the technical requirements necessary for the issuing of the Community inland navigation certificate give a level of safety equivalent to that required for the issuing of the certificate referred to in Article 22 of the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation.
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of Directive 2006/87/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission5 (3).
(7) In particular the Commission should be empowered to establish the conditions under which the technical requirements and administrative procedures set out in the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC may be amended. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2006/87/EC, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(8) On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of such measures amending the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC.
(9) On grounds of urgency, it is necessary to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of any amendment of the Annexes to Directive 2006/87/EC to take account of technical developments or related developments arising from the work of other international organisations, in particular the CCNR, as well as for the adoption of temporary requirements.

fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) The second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic (2) approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC (3), a certain amount of Community milk products exported to the Dominican Republic can benefit from reduced customs duties. For this reason, export refunds granted to products exported under this scheme should be reduced by a certain percentage.
(5) The uptake of export refunds for certain products proves to be insignificant. For such products, export refunds should no longer be fixed.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,","{'header': '15.9.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 252/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1361/2006\nof 14 September 2006\nfixing the export refunds on milk and milk products', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.\n\n((3)) The second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.\n\n((4)) In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic(2)approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC(3), a certain amount of Community milk products exported to the Dominican Republic can benefit from reduced customs duties.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the reduction in support granted to the markets in most agricultural products and in  particular the introduction of the stabilizers have considerable effects on the income of small  producers of arable crops; whereas, in accordance with the content of the Commission's  communication on rural development, measures should be introduced to alleviate those effects, the  scope of which is wider than simply the aid granted to small producers of cereals, which was  introduced to reduce the impact of the co-responsibility levy;
Whereas, with a view to achieving the abovementioned objectives, provision should be made for the  granting of aid per hectare, intended to offset loss of income, to producers of the products listed  in Article 1 (a) and (b) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common  organization of the market in cereals (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 1340/90 (5), of  the products listed in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1431/82 of 18 May 1982 laying down  special measures for peas, field beans and sweet lupins (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No  1104/88 (7), and of certain products listed in Article 1 (2) of Council Regulation N° 136/66/EEC of  22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (8),  as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1225/89 (9);
Whereas, for the purposes of applying the abovementioned aid scheme and with a view to its  objectives, the recipients should be defined in terms of the actual structures in the Community and  taking account of the specific provisions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 797/85 of 12  March  1985 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures (10), as last amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 752/90 (11);
Whereas the scheme provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 for small producers of cereals  constitutes an alternative, for Member States, to the scheme provided for by this Regulation;  whereas eligibility under these two schemes taken together should be excluded;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81 of 27 July 1981 laying down the general rules for the system of aid for cotton (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2053/92 (3), and in particular Article 5 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81, aid must be granted for unginned cotton harvested in the Community when the world market price for unginned cotton is below the guide price;
Whereas the aid is equal to the difference between these two prices;
Whereas the second sentence of Article 7 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89 of 3 May 1989 laying down rules implementing the system of aid for cotton (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2328/92 (5), stipulates that aid applications  may be lodged during May and July 1993 for both the 1992/93 and 1993/94 marketing years; whereas the aid valid for the two marketing years in question should therefore be fixed during those months;
Whereas in the absence of a guide price for cotton valid for the 1993/94 marketing year, the amount of aid to be granted where it is fixed in advance for that marketing year can be fixed only provisionally on the basis of the Commission's most recent  price proposals to the Council for the 1993/94 marketing year, taking account of the reduction provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 of 28 December 1992 amending the prices and amounts fixed in ecus as a result of the monetary  realignment of September and November 1992 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 784/93 (7); whereas this amount must therefore be applied provisionally only, and must be confirmed or replaced as soon as the price for the 1992/94 marketing year is  known;
Whereas, pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 2 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 of 2 July 1987 adjusting the system of aid for cotton (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2052/92 (9), the aid for cotton for the 1993/94  marketing year is reduced by ECU 5,140/100 kilograms as fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2511/92 (10) and by the reduction fixed to take account of the expected overrun of the maximum guaranteed quantity fixed by the second subparagraph of
Article 2
(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87; whereas, in these circumstances, the amount of the aid has been provisionally calculated on the basis of an overall reduction of ECU 20,359/100 kilograms;
Whereas the world market price for unginned cotton is determined periodically on the basis of the world prices recorded for ginned cotton and cotton seed, talking into account the estimated yield of the Community harvest in cotton seed and in ginned  cotton and also the net cost of ginning;
Whereas the world market price for ginned cotton and cotton seed is determined in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81;
Whereas, if the world market price for unginned cotton cannot be determined as described above, this price shall be established on the basis of the most recent price determined;
Whereas the world market price for unginned cotton is equal to the sum of the values for ginned cotton seed defined in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89, minus the cost of beginning;
Whereas the above values are established on the basis of the prices determined in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89; whereas the world market price is detrmined on the basis of the most favourable offers and quotations  recorded, excluding offers and quotations which cannot be regarded as representative of the real market trend;
Whereas the necessary adjustments must be made in cases where the offers and quotations recorded do not satisfy the requirements indicated above;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81, if there are no suitable offers or quotations for determing the world market price for cotton seed, that price shall be established on the basis of the most favourable offers and  quotations for cotton seed recorded on the Community market or, if those offers and quotations cannot be established, on the basis of the value of the products obtained from processing the seed in the Community, less the processing cost; whereas this  value is determined in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89;
Whereas the representative market rates defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (11) are used to convert amounts expressed in third country currencies and are used as the basis for determining the agricultural conversion rates of the  Member States' currencies; whereas detailed rules on the application and determination of these conversions are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 (12);
Whereas the aid must be fixed once a month, and in such a way that it can be applied for the first day of the month following the date of fixing; whereas it may be altered between fixings;

2.  By telex of 16 June 1988 the Commission again asked the Italian Government to provide the information specified in point 1.
3.  By letter of 4 July 1988 the Italian Permanent Representative notified the Commission of circular No 28148 of 30 December 1986 of the Minister of Agriculture.
4.  The said circular provides that, with a view of reducing storage costs, olive oil producers' groups and associations thereof are to be granted monthly aid of Lit 5 000 per quintal
of oil in storage. The Italian Government said that the measure was being introduced because the exceptional volume of olive production in 1987/88 had brought about a serious crisis on the market and, by the same token, a sharp fall in prices. In its  letter of 4 July 1988 the Italian Government pointed out that the measures would apply for two months only and that the period of storage of the olive oil would not extend beyond the date of entry into force of the Community rules on the storage of  olive oil - which were in the process of being adopted - and in no case beyond 28 February 1988.
5.  By letter of 5 August 1988 the Commission notified the Italian Government, inter alia, that:
- it was regrettable that, by not notifying it of the circular in good time, the Italian Government had failed to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty,
- after scrutinizing the provisions in question, it had decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of that measures,
- in its opinion, the scheme constituted operating aid which could have no lasting effect on the development of the sector concerned; its effects would cease to be felt as soon as the scheme ended; the Commission regarded such measures as incompatible  with the common market,
- moreover, the measure infringed Regulation No 136/66/EEC in that the latter should be regarded as complete and exhaustive, thus precluding unilateral supplementary measures by the Member States in the operation of the market organization,
- accordingly, the measure did not qualify as an exception as provided for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty,
- by virtue of Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, the measure in question could not be implemented until the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) had resulted in a final decision,
- it wished to draw the Italian Government's attention to the letter which the Commission had sent to all the Member States on 3 November 1983 regarding their
obligations pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, and to the communication published on 24 November 1983 (4), whereby any aid granted illegally, i.e. without awaiting a final decision under the procedure of Article 93 (2) may be the subject of an  application for reimbursement and/or may result in a refusal to pay EAGGF (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund) advances or declare chargeable to the EAGGF budget expenditure relating to national schemes which have a direct effect on  Community measures.
6.  By telex of 6 October 1988 the Italian Government replied to the Commission's letter of 5 August 1988. In their telex the Italian authorities emphasized in particular that the exceptional volume of olive oil production in 1987/88 had resulted in  increased management costs for the producers' groups operating in that sector and had a direct impact on olive growers' incomes; the heavier burden of expenditure resulting from the increased storage, administration and accounting costs had placed the  organizations concerned in a critical situation which was likely to have grave consequences - possibly leading to bankruptcy in some cases - and would thus have an irreversible adverse effect on the olive-growing sector.
7.  The Italian authorities provided information on the application of that measure at a bilateral meeting which took place on 22 February 1989 in Rome.
8.  Further to the undertakings given by its officials at that meeting, the Italian Government sent a telex to the Commission on 2 March 1989 informing it, inter alia, that:
- the aid provided for in circular No 28148 of 30 December 1987 of the Minister of Agriculture had not yet been paid,
- the measure had been adopted pending the adoption of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 315/88 of 2 February 1988 on olive oil storage contracts for the 1987/88 marketing year (5), the need for which had been recognized by the Commission at the beginning  of the 1987/88 marketing year (November 1987),
- in order to overcome the problems resulting from the measure, the Italian Government felt that the premium paid to those who were eligible could be recalculated on the basis of the amounts specified in Regulation (EEC) No 315/88.
9.  By telex of 6 March 1989 the Commission replied to the Italian Government's telex of 2 March, stating that:
- it had taken note of the confirmation that, up to the date on which the telex had been sent by the Italian authorities, no payment had been made on the basis of circular No 28148,
- it was inviting the Italian Government to specify whether the premium which the Italian authorities were planning to grant to groups and associations operating in the olive oil sector was solely that provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 315/88, or if  the premium constituted a national aid designed to supplement the Community premium referred to in that Regulation.
10.  By telex of 10 March 1989 Italy's Minister of Agriculture stated that:
- the national aid provided for in the circular was to be granted for the storage of olive oil in respect of a period beginning on 1 January 1988 and ending when the storage contract provided for in the Community regulations in force was signed, but in  no case later than 28 February 1988,
- the amount of the national aid would have to be recalculated on the basis of the Community premium, since the decision to grant the Community aid had been taken by the Commission at a very late stage.
II.
Concerning the points put forward by the Italian authorities it should be stressed that - even in a critical market situation - Italy is no longer empowered to adopt measures which are not provided for in the market organization for oils and fats. The  latter should be regarded as a complete and exhaustive system which precludes the adoption of unilateral supplementary measures by the Member States.
Accordingly, the measure in question is incompatible with the common market and does not qualify under any of the exceptions provides for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
In the light of the above the grounds put forward by the Italian authorities cannot be regarded as valid.
III
Italy's olive oil production in 1987/88 is put at about 650 000 tonnes and that of the Community at about 1 630 000 tonnes. During the same marketing year Italy's imports of olive oil from the other Member States totalled 200 000 tonnes, while for the  other Member States the figure was 50 000 tonnes. Italy exported 20 000 tonnes to the other Member States and 100 000 tonnes to third countries. The national storage aid provided for in circular No 28148 was set at Lit 5 000 per 100 kilograms. The aid  is equivalent to 1,4 % of the guaranteed intervention price to the producer and 1,5 % of the market value of the product.
IV.
1.  The aid for the storage and marketing of olive oil, as provided for in circular No 28148, would, if it were to be
granted, constitute operating aid to producers' groups and associations thereof and traders operating in the olive oil sector. It would enable the recipients to reduce their storage costs and arrive at more advantageous prices than would have been the  case without government intervention. The scheme is therefore likely to distort competition between recipients of the aid and their competitors in the other Member States, who are also faced with a situation of over-production but do not qualify for aid  of this type.
Moreover, the reduction in storage costs, which is equivalent to 1,5 % of the market value of the olive oil, would reduce the overheads in respect of the marketing of the product and enable Italian producers' groups and associations thereof, and traders  who wished to do so, to sell olive oil in Italy and in the other Member States on more favourable terms. The aid would make them more competitive on other Member States' markets; it is therefore likely to affect trade between Member States.
The measure in question accordingly corresponds to the criteria set out in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty, which provides that aids which fulfil the conditions set out therein are, in principle, incompatible with the common market.
2.  The exceptions to that incompatibility, as provided for in Article 92 (2), are clearly not applicable in the case of these aid schemes. The exceptions provided for in paragraph 3 of the said Article specify objectives which are in the Community  interest and not in the interest of specific sectors of the national economy. Such exceptions should be interpreted in a narrow sense when scrutinizing a regional or sectoral aid scheme or any individual case in which general aid schemes are  implemented.
In particular, such exceptions may be granted only in cases where the Commission is in a position to establish that the aid is necessary for achievement of one of the objectives set out in those provisions. To allow such exceptions in respect of aids  which do not offer such guarantees would amount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without justification from the point of view of the Community interest and would bring about unfair advantage for  certain Member States.
In the case in point, the aid system does not offer such guarantees. The Italian Government was unable to provide any justification, and the Commission could find none, showing that the aid in question fulfils the conditions required for granting one of  the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
They are not measures intended to promote a project of common European interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (b) since, because of their potential effect on trade, they run counter to the common interest.
Nor are they measures intended to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the Member State in question, within the meaning of that provision.
As regards the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) concerning aids to promote or facilitate the economic development of areas or of certain activities referred to in the said subparagraph (c), it should be pointed out that the measure,  being in the nature of an operating aid, cannot bring about lasting improvement in the conditions of the holdings or undertakings receiving the aid, since as soon as the aid ceases to be granted they would be in the same structural situation as obtained  prior to the entry into force of the State scheme.
Consideration should, moreover, be given to the fact that the circular of the Minister of Agriculture provides for granting storage aid for olive oil in respect of the period 1 January to 28 February 1988. This means that the national aid would be  granted not only before the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 315/88 but also, between 6 February (the date of entry into force of the Regulation) and 28 February 1988 (the last possible day of eligibility for the national aid), concurrently with  the Community premium. This would make the adverse effects of the scheme even worse.
Accordingly, the aid cannot be regarded as eligible under any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (2) and (3) of the Treaty.
3.  It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the aid concerns a product which is the subject of an EEC market organization and that there are limitations on Member States' powers to intervene directly in the operation of market organizations  comprising a system of common prices, this being an area where the Community now has exclusive powers.
The grant of the aid in question is at odds with the principle that the Member States no longer have the power to make, by granting aid of this type, unilateral arrangements relating to farmers' incomes within the framework of a market organization. The  infringement of the rules of the market organization would have precluded the granting of an exception pursuant to Article 92 (3) even if such an exception had otherwise been possible.
4.  The aid circular must be regarded as incompatible with the common market and must be annulled,","{'title': '89/660/EEC: Commission Decision of 24 May 1989 prohibiting the aid planned by the Italian Government for the storage and marketing of olive oil (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe grant, to olive oil producers' groups and associations thereof and olive oil traders, of aid for storage and marketing, as provided for in circular No 28148 of\n\n30 December 1987 of the Italian Minister of Agriculture, is illegal pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty.

(2) France still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/2004 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the French intervention agency available on the internal market, which had earlier been destined for export under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1081/2002(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1094/2003(6), and to repeal that Regulation.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender; in addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.
(6) When the French intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.
(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1513/2003 of 27 August 2003 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of 435000 tonnes of barley held by the French intervention agency', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

amending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 (2) established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties.
(2) In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan and the Eastern Partnership, the Republic of Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Republic of Moldova has also already made strong progress on regulatory approximation leading to convergence with Union laws and standards.
(3) The Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part (3) (the Association Agreement), including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), was signed on 27 June 2014 and the provisional application was effective from 1 September 2014.
(4) The specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015.
(5) In order to support the efforts of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, and to provide an attractive and reliable market for its exports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes, further concessions should be made for the import of those products from the Republic of Moldova into the Union, on the basis of duty free tariff quotas.
(6) It is also necessary to amend certain CN codes in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 in order to reflect the amendments introduced in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (4) by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1001/2013 (5).
(7) In order to allow the operators to benefit from those further concessions as soon as possible, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(8) In view of the seasonal production peak of those products, it is appropriate to apply the further concessions from 1 August 2014.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '30.12.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 372/1', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 1383/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 18 December 2014\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introducing autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008(2)established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences for the Republic of Moldova.

(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Meloxicam and tilmicosin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 85/591/EEC of 20 December 1985 concerning the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the monitoring of foodstuffs intended for human consumption(1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food(2) provides that maximum levels must be set for certain contaminants in foodstuffs in order to protect public health.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(3) establishes, besides others, maximum levels for lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) in foodstuffs and makes reference to the measures laying down the sampling and analysis methods to be used.
(3) Council Directive 89/397/EEC of 14 June 1989 on the official control of foodstuffs(4) lays down the general principles for the performance of control of foodstuffs. Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(5) introduces a system of quality standards for laboratories entrusted by the Member States with the official control of foodstuffs.
(4) Sampling plays a crucial role in obtaining representative results for the determination of the levels of the contaminants which may be heterogeneously distributed in a lot.
(5) Directive 85/591/EEC has fixed general criteria for methods of sampling and analysis but in certain cases more specific criteria become necessary in order to ensure that laboratories, in charge of the control, use methods of analysis with comparable levels of performance.
(6) The provisions for the sampling and methods of analysis have been drawn up on the basis of present knowledge and they may be adapted to take account of advances in scientific and technological knowledge.
(7) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs (Text with EEA relevance.)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that the sampling for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs is carried out in accordance with the methods described in Annex I to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure that sample preparation and methods of analyses used for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs comply with the criteria described in Annex II to this Directive.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe Member States shall, not later than 5 April 2003, bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with the provisions of this Directive.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE\n\nSamples intended for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD contents in foodstuffs shall be taken according to the methods described below. Aggregate samples thus obtained shall be considered as representative of the lots or sublots from which they are taken. Compliance with maximum levels laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 shall be established on the basis of the levels determined in the laboratory samples.\n\n2. DEFINITIONS\n\n>TABLE>\n\n3. GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n3.1. Personnel\n\nSampling shall be performed by an authorised qualified person as specified by the Member States.\n\n3.2. Material to be sampled\n\nEach lot which is to be examined must be sampled separately.\n\n3.3. Precautions to be taken\n\nIn the course of sampling and preparation of laboratory samples precautions must be taken to avoid any changes which would affect the lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD contents, adversely affect the analytical determination or make the aggregate samples unrepresentative.\n\n3.4. Incremental samples\n\nAs far as possible incremental samples shall be taken at various places distributed throughout the lot or sublot. Departure from this procedure must be recorded in the record provided for under 3.8.\n\n3.5. Preparation of the aggregate sample\n\nThe aggregate sample is made up by uniting all incremental samples. It shall be at least 1 kg unless not practical, e.g. when a single package has been sampled.\n\n3.6. Subdivision of aggregate sample in laboratory samples for enforcement, defence and referee purposes\n\nThe laboratory samples for enforcement, trade (defence) and referee purposes shall be taken from the homogenised aggregate sample unless this conflicts with Member States' regulations on sampling. The size of the laboratory samples for enforcement shall be sufficient to allow at least for duplicate analyses.\n\n3.7. Packaging and transmission of aggregate and laboratory samples\n\nEach aggregate and laboratory sample shall be placed in a clean, inert container offering adequate protection from contamination, from loss of analytes by adsorption to the internal wall of the container and against damage in transit. All necessary precautions shall be taken to avoid change of composition of the aggregate and laboratory samples which might arise during transportation or storage.\n\n3.8. Sealing and labelling of aggregate and laboratory samples\n\nEach sample taken for official use shall be sealed at the place of sampling and identified following the Member States' regulations. A record must be kept of each sampling, permitting each lot to be identified unambiguously and giving the date and place of sampling together with any additional information likely to be of assistance to the analyst.\n\n4. SAMPLING PLANS\n\nSampling should ideally take place at the point where the commodity enters the food chain and a discrete lot becomes identifiable. The sampling method applied shall ensure that the aggregate sample is representative for the lot that is to be controlled.\n\n4.1. Number of incremental samples\n\nIn the case of liquid products for which a homogeneous distribution of the contaminant in question can be assumed within a given lot, it is sufficient to take one incremental sample per lot which forms the aggregate sample. Reference to the lot number shall be given. Liquid products containing hydrolysed vegetable protein (HVP) or liquid soya sauce shall be shaken well, or homogenised by other suitable means, before the incremental sample is taken.\n\nFor other products, the minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot shall be as given in Table 1. The incremental samples shall be of similar weight. Departure from this procedure must be recorded in the record provided for under 3.8.\n\nTable 1: Minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from the lot\n\n>TABLE>\n\nIf the lot consists of individual packages, then the number of packages which shall be taken to form the aggregate sample is given in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Number of packages (incremental samples) which shall be taken to form the aggregate sample if the lot consists of individual packages\n\n>TABLE>\n\n5. COMPLIANCE OF THE LOT OR SUBLOT WITH THE SPECIFICATION\n\nThe control laboratory shall analyse the laboratory sample for enforcement at least in two independent analyses, and calculate the mean of the results. The lot is accepted if the mean conforms to the respective maximum level as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001. It is rejected if the mean exceeds the respective maximum level.""}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nSAMPLE PREPARATION AND CRITERIA FOR METHODS OF ANALYSIS USED IN OFFICAL CONTROL OF THE LEVELS OF LEAD, CADMIUM, MERCURY AND 3-MCPD IN CERTAIN FOODSTUFFS\n\n1.

That natural handicap, recognised by Article 349 of the Treaty, resulting from the Canary Islands’ insularity, remoteness and outermost location can be remedied, inter alia, by temporarily suspending customs duties on imports of the products in question from third countries within autonomous Union tariff quotas of an appropriate volume.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 (1) opened and provided for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas on imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013.
(3) In July 2010 and June 2012, the Spanish authorities submitted reports on the implementation of the measures referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 645/2008. The Commission has examined the impact of those measures on the basis of those reports.
(4) The reports submitted by the Spanish authorities included information on the utilisation rate of the tariff quotas for the period from 2007 to 2011. That information showed that, on average, over that period, the tariff quota with order number 09.2997 was almost fully utilised, and that the tariff quota with order number 09.2651 was not exhausted.
(5) Since the tariff quota with order number 09.2997 was almost fully utilised, and the non-exhaustion of the tariff quota with order number 09.2651 could be linked to temporary and exogenous factors, it is appropriate to set the volume of the tariff quotas at the same level.
(6) The sharp decline in local demand for products covered by the tariff quota with order number 09.2651, due to the difficult economic conditions in the Canary Islands following the economic and financial crises, may explain the under-utilisation of that tariff quota.
(7) In September 2012, Spain requested the extension of Union tariff quotas for imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands, in accordance with Article 349 of the Treaty.
(8) Tariff quotas similar to those opened pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 645/2008 for certain fishery products are justified as they would cover the needs of the Canary Islands' domestic market, while ensuring that flows of reduced-duty imports into the Union remain predictable and clearly identifiable.
(9) Therefore, with the aim of giving a long-term perspective to economic operators to reach a level of activity which stabilises the economic and social environment of the Canary Islands, it is appropriate to extend, for an additional period, the autonomous tariff quota regime of the Common Customs Tariff duties for the goods listed in the Annex to this Regulation.
(10) In order to avoid undermining the integrity and the coherence of the internal market, measures should be taken to ensure that fishery products for which suspension is granted are intended solely for the Canary Islands’ domestic market.
(11) Measures should be taken to ensure that the Commission is kept regularly informed of the volume of imports in question so that, if necessary, it can take steps to prevent any speculative movement or deflection of trade.
(12) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission allowing the Commission to temporarily withdraw the suspension in the case of a deflection of trade. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). The final decision on whether the suspension should be maintained or withdrawn definitely should, however, be made by the Council in accordance with Article 349 of the Treaty within the time period for which suspension is temporarily withdrawn pursuant to the Commission decision to temporarily withdraw the suspension.
(13) The provisions to be adopted should ensure continuity with the measures set out in Regulation (EC) No 645/2008. Therefore, it is appropriate to apply the measures provided for in this Regulation from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020,","{'header': '28.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 353/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 1412/2013\nof 17 December 2013\nopening and providing for the administration of autonomous Union tariff quotas for imports of certain fishery products into the Canary Islands from 2014 to 2020', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The exceptional geographical situation of the Canary Islands in relation to the sources of supply of certain fishery products which are essential for domestic consumption entails additional costs for that sector.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard Council Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007 establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (1), and in particular Article 5(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) Bearing in mind the objectives of the foundation of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (hereinafter the Agency) and in order for the Agency to carry out its tasks properly, the precise thematic areas of its activity are to be determined by a Multi-annual Framework covering five years as stipulated in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 168/2007.
(2) The Framework should include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance amongst the thematic areas of the Agency’s activity.
(3) The Framework should be in line with Union’s priorities, taking due account of the orientations resulting from the European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions in the field of fundamental rights.
(4) The Framework should have due regard to the Agency’s financial and human resources and should be conducted only within the scope of Community law.
(5) The Framework should include provisions with a view of ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Community and Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights. The most relevant Community agencies and bodies in relation to this Multi-annual Framework are the European Institute for Gender Equality established by Regulation (EC) No 1922/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing a European Institute for Gender Equality (2) and the European Data Protection Supervisor established by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3), and the European Ombudsman, the objectives of which should consequently be taken into account.
(6) The Commission, while preparing its proposal, has consulted the Management Board of the Fundamental Rights Agency during its meeting of 12-13 July 2007 and received written comments by letter of 25 July 2007.
(7) This Framework defines the precise thematic areas of the work of the Agency, whereas several permanent tasks of the Agency are determined in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 168/2007, inter alia, the task of raising the awareness of the general public about their fundamental rights and about active dissemination of information about the work of the Agency.
(8) The Agency, upon a request of the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission, provided its financial and human resources so permit, can work outside the thematic areas determined in the Multi-annual Framework, in accordance with Article 5(3) of the Regulation (EC) No 168/2007,","{'header': '7.3.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 63/14', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 28 February 2008\nimplementing Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 as regards the adoption of a Multi-annual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2007-2012\n(2008/203/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Bearing in mind the objectives of the foundation of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (hereinafter the Agency) and in order for the Agency to carry out its tasks properly, the precise thematic areas of its activity are to be determined by a Multi-annual Framework covering five years as stipulated in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 168/2007.\n\n((2)) The Framework should include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance amongst the thematic areas of the Agency’s activity.\n\n((3)) The Framework should be in line with Union’s priorities, taking due account of the orientations resulting from the European Parliament resolutions and Council conclusions in the field of fundamental rights.\n\n((4)) The Framework should have due regard to the Agency’s financial and human resources and should be conducted only within the scope of Community law.\n\n((5)) The Framework should include provisions with a view of ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Community and Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights.

of 10 June 2002
on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(4), (ESA 95), contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) The report by the Monetary Committee on information requirements, endorsed by the Ecofin Council on 18 January 1999, underlined that, for the proper functioning of economic and monetary union and the single market, effective surveillance and coordination of economic policies are of major importance and that this requires a comprehensive statistical information system providing policy-makers with the necessary data on which to base their decisions. That report also stated that a high priority should be given to short-term public finance statistics for Member States, in particular those participating in economic and monetary union, and that the objective was the compilation of simplified quarterly non-financial accounts for the general government sector resulting from a step-by-step approach.
(3) It is appropriate to define simplified quarterly non-financial accounts for general government by reference to the list of ESA 95 categories of government expenditure and revenue defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1500/2000 of 10 July 2000 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to general government expenditure and revenue(5).
(4) Priority in the step-by-step approach was given to taxes, actual social contributions and social benefits other than social transfers in kind, as categories representing reliable indicators of trends in public finances that are already available on time (first step).
(5) The transmission of this first set of categories on a quarterly basis, from June 2000, in all Member States is covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to short-term public finance statistics(6).
(6) It is necessary to supplement the first step with another set of categories in order to obtain the full list of categories constituting general government expenditure and revenue.
(7) The reliability of quarterly data provided under this Regulation with regard to annual data should be assessed. A report on the quality of the quarterly data should therefore be made before the end of 2005.
(8) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 lay down the conditions under which the Commission may adopt amendments to the ESA 95 methodology in order to clarify and improve its content. The compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts for general government will require additional resources in Member States. Their transmission to the Commission cannot therefore be dealt with in a Commission Decision.
(9) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7), and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB), set up by Council Decision 91/115/EEC(8), have each been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of those Decisions,","{'title': 'Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this Regulation is to define the content of quarterly non-financial accounts for general government, to lay down the list of the ESA 95 categories to be transmitted by Member States from 30 June 2002 and to specify the main characteristics of these categories.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nContent of the quarterly non-financial accounts for general government\n\nThe content of the quarterly non-financial accounts for general government is defined in the Annex by reference to a list of ESA 95 categories constituting general government expenditure and revenue.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nCategories concerned by the transmission of quarterly data\n\n1.

(1) Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(c), (d) and (g) of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector (2).
(5) Export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third country's exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position. Therefore, refunds for exports to those destinations should be abolished.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In December 1994, the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Committee for European Construction Equipment (CECE) on behalf of Community producers of hydraulic excavators. Having decided that the complaint was lodged on behalf of the Community industry, and that there was sufficient evidence of dumping and material injury resulting therefrom to justify the initiation of a proceeding, the Commission announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of hydraulic excavators weighing more than six tonnes originating in the Republic of Korea.
(2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant of the initiation of the proceedings and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) A number of producers in the country concerned, their related importers in the Community and some of the complaining Community producers replied to the questionnaire sent to them, made their views known in writing and requested, and were granted, hearings.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of its investigation and carried out investigations at the premises of the Community producers and four producers in Korea, and a number of importers in the Community.
(5) The period used for the investigation of dumping and injury was 1 January 1994 to 31 March 1995.
B. Products under consideration
(6) The products under consideration are self-propelled tracklaying and other hydraulic excavators weighing more than six tonnes and having a 360° revolving superstructure. The products fall under CN codes ex 8429 52 10 and ex 8429 52 90.
C. Withdrawal of the complaint and termination of the proceeding
(7) The Commission, having concluded its investigation, informed the complainant of the results thereof. The complainant subsequently withdrew the complaint.
(8) The decision of the complainant is a sufficient ground to terminate the proceeding unless it is established that such termination would be contrary to the interest of the Community. The Commission has neither received nor is aware of any indications in the present case that the termination of this proceeding would be against the interest of the Community.
(9) In these circumstances, it is considered that protective measures are unnecessary and that accordingly, the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of hydraulic excavators weighing more than six tonnes originating in the Republic of Korea should be terminated without the imposition of such measures.
(10) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.
(11) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding and no comments were offered thereon,",{'title': '96/661/EC: Commission Decision of 26 November 1996 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of hydraulic excavators weighing more than six tonnes originating in the Republic of Korea'}

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 15(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in non-European countries, other than Mediterranean countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the continental States of the United States of America, may not in principle be introduced into the Union. However, that Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.
(2) Commission Decision 2003/249/EC (2) authorises Member States to provide for temporary derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC to permit the import of plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in Chile.
(3) The circumstances justifying the authorisation provided for in Decision 2003/249/EC are still present and there is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.
(4) By Commission Directive 2008/64/EC (3)
Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds was removed from point (c) of Section II of Part A of Annex II to Directive 2000/29/EC. Therefore this organism should no longer be included in the Annex of Decision 2003/249/EC.
(5) Based on the experience gained with the application of Decision 2003/249/EC it is appropriate to extend the period of validity of that authorisation for 10 years.

of 28 February 2000
adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community (Altener) (1998 to 2002)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), and in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 9 December 1999,
Whereas:
(1) Article 174 of the Treaty provides that one of the objectives of Community action is to ensure prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources.
(2) Article 152 of the Treaty provides that health protection requirements are to form a constituent part of the Community's other policies; the Altener programme set out in this Decision contributes to health protection.
(3) At its meeting on 29 October 1990 the Council set an objective of stabilising total CO2 emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level in the Community as a whole.
(4) The Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change contains further commitments for the Community and its Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the undertaking given by the Community to the effect that an 8 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the years 2008 to 2012 compared with 1990 levels would be achieved.
(5) A mechanism for monitoring CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions in the Community was established by Council Decision 93/389/EEC(4).
(6) C02 emissions from energy consumption in the Community are likely to increase by about 3 % between 1995 and 2000, assuming normal economic growth. In the light of the abovementioned Kyoto undertaking, it is essential to adopt additional measures; measures which would genuinely help to achieve the above objective include a much more intensive use of renewable energy sources as well as energy efficiency.
(7) At its meeting on 25 and 26 June 1996 the Council noted that in the framework of the negotiations on a protocol concerning the Berlin Mandate, the second assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (SAR IPCC) had concluded that the balance of evidence suggested that there was a discernible human influence on global climate change and had stressed the need for urgent action at the widest possible level, noted that significant ""no-regrets"" opportunities were available and requested the Commission to identify the measures that had to be taken at Community level.
(8) By the Green Paper of 11 January 1995 and the White Paper of 13 December 1995 the Commission communicated to the European Parliament and the Council its views on the future of energy policy in the Community and on the role that renewable energy sources should play.
(9) In its Resolution of 4 July 1996 on a Community action plan for renewable energy sources(5) the European Parliament called upon the Commission to implement a Community action plan to promote renewable energy sources.
(10) By the Green Paper of 20 November 1996 and the White Paper of 26 November 1997 entitled ""Energy for the future: Renewable sources of energy"", the Commission started a process for the development and further implementation of a Community strategy and an action plan on renewable energy sources; these are set out, together with a ""Campaign for take-off"", in its White Paper;
(11) In its resolution of 15 May 1997(6) on the Green Paper entitled ""Energy for the future: Renewable sources of energy"", the European Parliament urged the Commission to adopt as soon as possible a strengthened Altener II programme; in its resolution of 18 June 1998(7) on the Commission communication ""Energy for the future: Renewable sources of energy White Paper for a Community strategy and action plan"", it called for a clear increase in funding for the Altener programme in the energy framework programme;
(12) In its resolution of 14 November 1996(8) on the Commission White Paper on an energy policy for the European Union, the European Parliament called on the Commission to develop a financial programme to stimulate renewable energy.
(13) In its above mentioned resolution of 15 May 1997 on the Green Paper on renewable sources of energy, the European Parliament called for attention to be paid to the possibility of coordinating policies and initiatives in the sphere of renewable energy and energy efficiency in order to develop potential existing synergies and avoid duplication of efforts wherever possible.
(14) Article 8 of Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity(9) offers Member States the possibility of furthering the penetration of the market in electricity produced from renewable sources of energy by giving them priority.
(15) Article 158 of the Treaty provides that the Community is to develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic and social cohesion and that, in particular, it is to aim at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least-favoured regions; those actions cover, inter alia, the energy sector.
(16) In Decision 93/500/EEC(10) and Decision 98/352/EC(11), the Council adopted a Community programme entitled Altener for the promotion of renewable energy sources aimed at reducing C02 emissions by increasing the market share of renewable energy sources and its contribution to overall primary energy production in the Community.
(17) The Community has recognised that the Altener programme represents an important element of the Community strategy for reducing CO2 emissions.
(18) Provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998 to 2002) adopted by Council Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom(12) for a specific programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources; this specific programme would replace the corresponding instrument currently in force.
(19) In implementing Decision No 182/1999/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 1998 concerning the fifth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (1998 to 2002)(13), Council Decision 1999/170/EC of 25 January 1999 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration on energy, environment and sustainable development (1998 to 2002)(14) devotes particular attention to efficient and renewable energy technologies; the Altener programme is an instrument which complements that programme.
(20) The Altener programme does not alter national projects or systems for the promotion of renewable resources; its objective is to add a Community aspect that represents added value.
(21) Renewable energy sources are an important energy source for the European Union with considerable commercial potential; their development should therefore be supported through a specific strategy and targeted actions to make them both viable and competitive and thus create a favourable environment for investment.
(22) The increased use of renewable sources of energy will have a positive effect both on the environment and on the security of energy supplies; the free and large-scale development of renewable energy sources will make it possible fully to exploit their economic and employment potential; a high degree of international cooperation is desirable to achieve the best results.
(23) A strengthened Altener programme represents an essential instrument for developing the potential of renewable energy sources; renewable energy sources should account for a reasonable share of the European internal energy market.
(24) In order to ensure proper implementation of the Community Strategy and Action Plan up to 2010 for renewable energy sources, the Commission needs appropriate mechanisms for monitoring and assessing the various initiatives.
(25) The aim of the targeted actions referred to in Article 2(d) of this Decision is to facilitate and accelerate investment in new operational capacity for the production of energy from renewable sources by providing financial support, in particular for small- and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs), in order to reduce the peripheral and service costs of renewable energy projects, and thus overcome the non-technical obstacles present; those actions promote, inter alia, access to specialised advice, the analysis of market prospects, the choice of location of projects, application for construction and operation permits, initiatives taken by SMEs on investment in renewable sources of energy, the establishment of financing plans, the preparation of calls for tenders, the training of operators and plant commissioning.
(26) Those targeted actions concern the implementation of projects carried out in the area of biomass, including energy crops, firewood, residues from forestry and agriculture, municipal waste which cannot be recycled, liquid biofuels and biogas, and in the areas of thermal and photovoltaic solar systems, passive and active solar systems in buildings, small scale (less than 10 MW) hydroelectric projects, wave energy, wind power and geothermal energy.
(27) The development of renewable energy sources can help create a competitive energy system for the whole of Europe and develop a European renewable energy sources industry with vast opportunities for the export of technology and know-how and for investments in third countries involving Community participation in the framework of cooperation programmes.
(28) It is politically and economically desirable to open the Altener programme to the associated central and eastern European countries, in accordance with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of 21 and 22 June 1993 as confirmed by subsequent European Councils and as outlined in the Commission communication on that subject in May 1994, and also to Cyprus.
(29) In order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work is avoided the Commission will ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; it will systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects.
(30) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(15).
(31) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme a financial framework constituting the principal point of reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999(16), on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations(2), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 4 of Directive 94/62/EC stipulates that the Commission shall help to promote the prevention of packaging waste formation by encouraging the development of suitable European standards.
(2) Article 10 of Directive 94/62/EC indicates that the Commission shall promote, as appropriate, the preparation of European standards relating to the essential requirements referred to in Annex II thereto.
(3) When packaging is manufactured for a specific product in accordance with a harmonised standard whose references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the packaging is presumed to comply with the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as covered by that harmonised standard.
(4) Article 9 of Directive 94/62/EC stipulates that the Commission shall ensure that the references of the harmonised standards which comply with the essential requirements defined by the Directive are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(5) The Member States are required to publish the references of the national standards transposing the harmonised standards whose references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(6) In 2000, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) approved five standards (EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000) in line with the mandate which the Commission issued to this body under Directive 94/62/EC, after consultation with the committee set up under Directive 98/34/EC. These standards were presented to the Commission as harmonised standards.
(7) In 2000, in application of Aricle 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Belgium raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.
(8) In 2000, in application of Article 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Denmark raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000 and EN 13431:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.
(9) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13428:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, with the exception of the requirements of the third indent of Annex II(1) to the Directive. This harmonised standard must accordingly be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities with a warning stating that it does not cover the requirements of that indent.
(10) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13429:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(2) to the Directive. In particular, this standard does not cover the mandated requirement for a minimum number of trips or rotations in normally predictable conditions of use, or define a test method for checking this minimum number of trips or rotations. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(11) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13430:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3a) to the Directive. In particular, the standard does not cover the essential requirements stipulating that in order to be considered recyclable, packaging must be manufactured in such a way as to enable the recycling of a certain percentage by weight of the materials used, according to the type of material used for the packaging. The standard does not, moreover, cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to cause problems in recovery and sorting prior to recycling, in the recycling process itself or in recycled products. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(12) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13431:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive, as specified in Annex II(3b) to Directive 94/62/EC, for a minimum lower calorific value to allow optimisation of energy recovery. Furthermore, the standard does not cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to present problems in recovery and sorting prior to energy recovery, or in the energy recovery process itself. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(13) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13432:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3c) and (3d). This harmonised standard must, accordingly, be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(14) The Commission now calls on the CEN to undertake work to improve those standards which either in part or in full do not fulfil the essential requirements defined in the Directive,","{'title': '2001/524/EC: Commission Decision of 28 June 2001 relating to the publication of references for standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000 in the Official Journal of the European Communities in connection with Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2001) 1681)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe references of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the form given in the Annex, accompanied by the following warning: ""Users of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 should note that this standard does not cover the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC as specified in the third indent of Annex II(1) thereto.""\n\nWhen Member States publish the references of the national standard transposing harmonised standard EN 13428:2000, the publication must be accompanied by a warning identical to the one provided for in the first indent.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe references of harmonised standards EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000 and EN 13431:2000 are not published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe references of harmonised standard EN 13432:2000 are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in the form given in the Annex.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 June 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMargot Wallström\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10.\n\n(2) OJ L 204, 21.7.1998, p. 37.\n\n(3) OJ L 217, 5.8.1998, p. 18.\n\nANNEX\n\nPublication of the references of harmonised standards pursuant to Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNote:\n\nUsers of harmonised standard EN 13428:2000 should note that this standard does not cover the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in the first and third indents of Annex II(1) to that Directive.\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNote:\n\n- Any information concerning the availability of the standards can be obtained either from the European standardisation bodies or from the national standardisation bodies, a list of which is annexed to Directive 98/34/EC, as amended by Directive 98/48/EC.\n\n- Publication of the references in the Official Journal of the European Communities does not imply that the standards are available in all the Community languages.\n\nThe Commission ensures the updating of this list.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 14(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The complete, consistent, transparent and accurate monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Commission Decision 2007/589/EC of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) are fundamental for the effective functioning of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme established in Directive 2003/87/EC.
(2) Article 14(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that from 1 January 2010 an aircraft operator should monitor and report for each calendar year the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted from the flights it operates in accordance with the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC.
(3) Each aircraft operator should prepare and submit a monitoring plan to its administering Member State setting out the measures it intends to implement to monitor and report its emissions and that the competent authorities of the administering Member State should approve such monitoring plans in accordance with the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC.
(4) Part 4 of Annex XIV to Decision 2007/589/EC reduces the administrative burden for certain aircraft operators responsible for a limited number of flights per annum or with small emissions of carbon dioxide by establishing a simplified procedure to estimate the fuel consumption of the aircraft they operate using tools implemented by the European organisation for air safety navigation (Eurocontrol) or other relevant organisations which can process all relevant air traffic information such as that available to Eurocontrol if these tools have been approved by the Commission.
(5) Eurocontrol has established and documented a simplified tool for the estimation of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for specific flights between aerodromes. That tool uses the actual route length of each flight based upon the most comprehensive air traffic and operational flight information currently available and addresses the fuel consumed during all aspects of a particular flight including that at the departure gate, during taxiing operations, during landing, take-off and cruise as well as during air traffic management actions. The tool uses statistically robust fuel consumption coefficients for the most important aircraft types as well as a more generic approach for other aircraft which determines fuel consumption coefficients as a function of the aircraft’s maximum take-off mass which result in acceptable levels of uncertainty.
(6) This tool meets the requirements of the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC in respect of the approach based on individual flights, actual route length and statistically sound fuel consumption relationships. It is therefore appropriate that this tool be available and approved for use by the relevant aircraft operators in order to allow them to fulfil their monitoring and reporting obligations in an administratively less burdensome manner.
(7) Due to reasons beyond its control, an aircraft operator may be unable to monitor the actual fuel consumed for a particular flight. In such circumstances, and in the absence of other means to determine the actual fuel consumption, it is appropriate that the fuel consumption estimation tool utilised by small emitters should also be available to other aircraft operators to determine estimates of fuel consumption for specific flights where actual fuel consumption data is missing.
(8) Part 6 of Annex XIV to Decision 2007/589/EC requires an aircraft operator which employs a fuel consumption estimation tool to include in its monitoring plan evidence that the conditions for small emitters are satisfied, as well as providing a confirmation and description of the tool used.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,","{'header': '10.7.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 175/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 606/2010\nof 9 July 2010\non the approval of a simplified tool developed by the European organisation for air safety navigation (Eurocontrol) to estimate the fuel consumption of certain small emitting aircraft operators\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The complete, consistent, transparent and accurate monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the guidelines laid down in Commission Decision 2007/589/EC of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)are fundamental for the effective functioning of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme established in Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\n((2)) Article 14(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that from 1 January 2010 an aircraft operator should monitor and report for each calendar year the quantity of carbon dioxide emitted from the flights it operates in accordance with the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC.\n\n((3)) Each aircraft operator should prepare and submit a monitoring plan to its administering Member State setting out the measures it intends to implement to monitor and report its emissions and that the competent authorities of the administering Member State should approve such monitoring plans in accordance with the guidelines established by Decision 2007/589/EC.\n\n((4)) Part 4 of Annex XIV to Decision 2007/589/EC reduces the administrative burden for certain aircraft operators responsible for a limited number of flights per annum or with small emissions of carbon dioxide by establishing a simplified procedure to estimate the fuel consumption of the aircraft they operate using tools implemented by the European organisation for air safety navigation (Eurocontrol) or other relevant organisations which can process all relevant air traffic information such as that available to Eurocontrol if these tools have been approved by the Commission.\n\n((5)) Eurocontrol has established and documented a simplified tool for the estimation of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for specific flights between aerodromes.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1667/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Examination of the balance sheet shows that exportable amounts of rice are currently held by producers. This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 2001/02 marketing year.
(2) In order to remedy this situation, it is appropriate to make use of export refunds to zones which may be supplied by the Community. The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds, and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the refund amount to be fixed by tendering procedure.
(3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 299/95(4), apply to this invitation to tender.
(4) In order to avoid disturbances on the markets of the producing countries, the invitation to tender should be limited to certain countries.
(5) Pursuant to Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2452/2000(6), amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders.

approving cyproconazole as an existing active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 8
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes cyproconazole.
(2) Cyproconazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 8 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Ireland was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 30 May 2012 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated in an assessment report reviewed within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 March 2014.
(5) According to that assessment report, biocidal products used for product-type 8 and containing cyproconazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve cyproconazole for use in biocidal products for product-type 8 subject to compliance with such specifications and conditions.
(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) The report concludes that cyproconazole meets the criteria for being classified as toxic for reproduction category 1B in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), and for being very persistent (vP) and toxic (T) according to Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Notwithstanding the fact that the existing harmonised classification of cyproconazole should be revised pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, those intrinsic properties should be taken into account for the purpose of determining the period of approval.
(9) Since the conditions of the first subparagraph of Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 are not met, the current practice under Directive 98/8/EC should be followed. The period of approval should therefore be five years.
(10) However, for the purpose of authorising products in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, cyproconazole shall be considered as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 10(1)(a) and (d) of that Regulation.
(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements laid down.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '30.4.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 128/68', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 438/2014\nof 29 April 2014\napproving cyproconazole as an existing active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type 8\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Italian Government submitted to the Commission on 24 November 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the region of Lombardy fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The plan includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other financial instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The Single Programming Document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(8) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(9) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(10) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this Single Programming Document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/571/EC: Commission Decision of 10 December 2001 approving the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Lombardy in Italy (notified under document number C(2001) 2878)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Lombardy in Italy eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(1)(b)(i) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2008/866/EC of 12 November 2008 on emergency measures suspending imports from Peru of certain bivalve molluscs intended for human consumption (2) was adopted as a result of contamination with the hepatitis A virus (HAV) of certain bivalve molluscs imported from Peru which were identified as being at the origin of an outbreak of hepatitis A in humans. That Decision initially applied until 31 March 2009 but this period of application was extended until 30 November 2009 by Commission Decision 2009/297/EC of 26 March 2009 amending Decision 2008/866/EC as regards its period of application (3).
(2) The Peruvian authorities have provided information concerning the corrective measures put in place to improve control of the production of bivalve molluscs intended for export to the Community.
(3) A Commission inspection mission has been carried out from 7 to 18 September 2009 in order to evaluate the control systems in place governing the production of bivalve molluscs and fishery products intended for export to the European Union.
(4) The inspection visit verified that the Peruvian authorities are putting in place the corrective measures contained in the information they provided after the outbreak of hepatitis A. They are, in particular, completely reviewing the classification of the production areas and will also review the monitoring of the production areas as regards the sampling procedure and its frequency. These revisions are still ongoing.
(5) In order to protect the health of consumers it is necessary to maintain the protective measures provided by Decision 2008/866/EC until the Peruvian authorities have completed the implementation of the corrective measures and the Commission has carried out a further inspection on the spot. It is therefore appropriate to extend the application of Decision 2008/866/EC until 30 November 2010, without prejudice of the power of the Commission to modify, repeal or extend those measures in the light of any new information related to the evolution of the situation in Peru and of the outcome of inspections by its services.
(6) Decision 2008/866/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 314/90', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 November 2009\namending Decision 2008/866/EC as regards its period of application\n(notified under document C(2009) 9326)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/862/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2008/866/EC of 12 November 2008 on emergency measures suspending imports from Peru of certain bivalve molluscs intended for human consumption(2)was adopted as a result of contamination with the hepatitis A virus (HAV) of certain bivalve molluscs imported from Peru which were identified as being at the origin of an outbreak of hepatitis A in humans.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (1) and as last revised in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on 23 June 2010 (2), hereinafter referred to as ‘the Cotonou Agreement’, and in particular Article 96 thereof,
Having regard to the Internal Agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement (3), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2002/148/EC (4), consultations with the Republic of Zimbabwe under Article 96(2)(c) of the Cotonou Agreement were concluded and appropriate measures, as specified in the Annex to that Decision, were taken. These measures have since been adapted and their period of application extended each year.
(2) By Decision 2012/96/EU (5) the appropriate measures were adapted and their period of application extended for six months until 20 August 2012.
(3) The Union recognises the creation of the Government of National Unity in Zimbabwe as an opportunity to re-establish a constructive relationship between the Union and Zimbabwe and to support the implementation of Zimbabwe’s reform programme.
(4) By means of Council Decision 2012/97/CFSP of 17 February 2012 amending Decision 2011/101/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Zimbabwe (6), the Union took a significant decision to relax parallel CFSP sanctions on individuals with a view to encouraging further progress and thereby demonstrating its strong commitment to the Global Political Agreement process. The high level consultations held in Brussels with the Zimbabwe Ministerial re-engagement team in May 2012 constitute an important step forward in this re-engagement process.
(5) The Union continues to support the ongoing efforts of the Government of National Unity in implementing the Global Political Agreement, and welcomes the progress made in Zimbabwe to stabilise the economy and restore social services. The Union also continues to support the facilitation efforts led by South Africa on behalf of the Southern African Development Community.
(6) To demonstrate the Union’s continued commitment to the Global Political Agreement process, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2012/96/EU, while, however, suspending the application of the appropriate measures limiting cooperation under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement for a period of 12 months.
(7) Should there be a deterioration of the state of democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe, the Union could re-impose these appropriate measures and/or other measures at any time,","{'header': '10.8.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 213/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 August 2012\nextending the validity of Decision 2012/96/EU and suspending the application of the appropriate measures set out in Decision 2002/148/EC\n(2012/470/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 2002/148/EC(4), consultations with the Republic of Zimbabwe under Article 96(2)(c) of the Cotonou Agreement were concluded and appropriate measures, as specified in the Annex to that Decision, were taken.

In a letter dated 23 February 2012, the European Union informed you of its decision to further extend the period of application of those measures until 20 August 2012.\nThe European Union is encouraged by the progress that is being made in implementing the Global Political Agreement by the Government of National Unity in Zimbabwe. The European Union reiterates the great importance it attaches to the political dialogue provided for in Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement and which, at the request of the Government of Zimbabwe, was officially launched at the EU-Zimbabwe Ministerial Troika in June 2009 in Brussels. As agreed by both parties, the main objective of the Article 8 dialogue is to normalise EU-Zimbabwe relations along with the implementation of the reforms foreseen in the Global Political Agreement and to pave the way for peaceful and credible elections.\nThe European Union welcomes the constructive dialogue that has been established in the process of EU re-engagement with all parties in the Government of National Unity, including through the meeting in May this year between High Representative Ashton and the members of the Zimbabwe Ministerial Re-engagement Committee. The European Union welcomes the continued commitment of SADC to support the implementation of the Global Political Agreement, as expressed at the recent extraordinary SADC Summit in Luanda.\nThe steps taken by the Government of National Unity to improve the freedom and prosperity of the Zimbabwean people justify the immediate suspension of the measures hitherto applied under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. This will allow the European Union to work directly with the Government of National Unity and to develop new assistance programmes for the benefit of the people of Zimbabwe under the next European Development Fund. In this context, and in line with efforts supporting Zimbabwe’s re-engagement with the international financial institutions and the signing of an interim Economic Partnership Agreement, the European Investment Bank also envisages to re-launch development activities with the private sector in Zimbabwe.\nThe European Union welcomes the recent visit to Zimbabwe of the UN HCHR at the invitation of the Government of National Unity. The European Union attaches the utmost importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement, since respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law constitutes the essential basis of EU-Zimbabwe relations and the European Union will continue to closely follow the situation in Zimbabwe. It recognises the improvement that has been achieved in the human rights situation although significant areas of concern remain.\nAs indicated in February this year and consistent with its incremental approach, the European Union will further adjust its policy to recognise progress as it is made by the Zimbabwean parties along the SADC roadmap.\nThe European Union reaffirms its partnership with the people of Zimbabwe. The present European Union decision to suspend the application of the appropriate measures and re-engage in further dialogue and cooperation with the Government of National Unity is intended to provide additional impetus in enhancing EU-Zimbabwe relations, with the aim of normalising bilateral relations. The European Union calls on all parties to seize the momentum to complete implementation of the Global Political Agreement.\nYours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nC. ASHTON\nFor the Commission\nA.

approving aids from the Kingdom of Belgium to the coal-mining industry during 1983
(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)
(84/457/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 528/76/ECSC of 25 February 1976 regarding the Community system of measures taken by the Member States to assist the coal-mining industry (1),
Having consulted the Council,
I
Whereas the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium has informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 2 of the above Decision, of the financial measures which it intends to take during 1983 in order to give direct or indirect support to the coal-mining industry; whereas, of these measures, the following aids qualify for approval pursuant to that Decision:
1.2 //   // (Bfrs million)  // - Investment aid:  // 566,7  // - Recruitment of skilled workers:  // 12,0  // - Aid for stocks:  // 146,3  // - Aid to cover losses:  // 4 518,4
Whereas these aids meet the critera laid down in the Decision for the admissibility of such State assistance;
Whereas, of the investment aid, almost all of the Bfrs 566 700 000 will go to the Campine coalfield, so that the coalfield can maintain the production of coking coal, which is important for the Belgian steel industry;
Whereas the Belgian investment aid is therefore compatible with the provisions of Article 7 (2) of the Decision;
Whereas the aid (Bfrs 12 000 000) for recruiting and training skilled workers has proved necessary in order to attract suitably qualified labour into Belgian coal-mining, capable of operating modern plant and machinery properly;
Whereas the aid therefore complies with Article 8 of the Decision;
Whereas the Bfrs 146 300 000 aid to cover the costs of stocks of coal and coke is based on total producers' stocks amounting to more than 1 100 000 tonnes; whereas, with monthly production of around 500 000 tonnes, stocks eligible for aid under Article 9 (2) of the Decision amount to 600 000 tonnes; whereas the amount of aid per tonne is accordingly Bfrs 244; whereas the actual cost of stocks (including depreciation and interest) is substantially higher than the amount of aid;
Whereas the purpose and form of the aid show that it meets the criteria set out in Article 9 of the Decision;
Whereas the aid totalling Bfrs 4 518 400 000 to cover operating losses is paid to the two Belgian coalfields for different reasons; whereas the aid paid to the Campine coalfield will almost make up the difference between costs and returns; whereas this almost complete covering of the difference between costs and returns is necessary because the coalfield is intended to supply the Belgian steel industry with coking coal and must therefore maintain its output;
Whereas the purpose and amount of aid granted to cover losses in respect of the Campine coalfield therefore comply with the second subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (3) of the Decision;
Whereas, on the other hand, the Southern coalfield should be granted aid in respect of pit operating losses to cover part of the difference between costs and returns. Here the intention is to ensure that only essentials are maintained and the pits remain viable until the coalfield can be closed down without friction, so that serious economic and social upheaval is avoided;
Whereas the purpose and type of the aids to cover pit operating losses of the Southern coalfield are therefore compatible with the first subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (2) of the Decision;
II
Whereas, pursuant to Article 3 (2) of the Decision, all other measures to assist current production in 1983 must be taken into consideration for an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market;
Whereas, on this basis of assessment, the total amount of aid proposed is 162 500 000 ECU, i.e. 25,37 ECU per tonne; whereas this figure compared with 1982 (26,94 ECU per tonne) shows that there is a reduction of nearly 6 %;
Whereas the following observations can be made on the compatibility of the proposed current production aids with the proper functioning of the common market:
- there were no supply difficulties in 1983,
- rationalization of production in 1983 was achieved by investment,
- industrial consumers of coal did not receive aid in 1983 as a result of the prices of Belgian coking coal and steam coal;
Whereas it may be concluded that the aid granted to the Belgian coal-mining industry in 1983 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;
Whereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to the coal-mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC;
III
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '84/457/ECSC: Commission Decision of 6 September 1984 approving aids from the Kingdom of Belgium to the coal-mining industry during 1983 (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the 1983 calendar year to grant aid totalling Bfrs 5 243 400 000 to the Belgian coal-mining industry.\n\nThe amount of Bfrs 5 243 400 000 provided in respect of the 1983 calendar year is divided as follows:\n\n1.

(1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the common fisheries policy must provide for coherent measures concerning the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources, including specific measures to reduce the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems and non-target species.
(2) In order to protect the species cod, haddock and whiting, point 6.1 of Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 (2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009 (3), and Regulation (EU) No 579/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), establishes within ICES division VI a zone in which fishing activities are prohibited (hereafter referred to as the ‘waters to the west of Scotland’).
(3) By way of derogation from that prohibition, points 6.5 and 6.6 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 allow respectively the fishing for nephrops and the fishing with trawls, demersal seines or similar gear, provided that certain conditions are met, and in particular the requirement that no more than a certain percentage of the retained catch be comprised of any mixture of cod, haddock and/or whiting.
(4) The purpose of that requirement was to reduce fishing mortality on the three stocks within their area of distribution, by preventing a targeted fisheries.
(5) Evidence and advice received by the Commission from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) highlighted that discarding was occurring as a result of the imposition of the catch composition rules in ICES division VIa.
(6) ICES identifies the haddock stock in ICES division VIa to be below safe biological limits, however ICES further identifies that recent stronger-than-average recruitment will contribute to an increase in the spawning stock biomass.
(7) The continued growth of these year classes means that these fish are now entering the fishery. Imposition of the catch composition rules will result in further increases in discarding of this stock to meet landing requirements before they contribute to future production. The removal of spawning biomass for a stock below safe biological limits represents a serious threat to the long-term recovery and sustainability of the stock. Landings not catches are controlled by the continued application of the catch composition rules. Regardless of any quota change the current increasing abundance of the haddock stock will result in increasing levels of regulatory induced discarding.
(8) An increase of fishing pressure will result from increased fishing opportunities for the stock of haddock in ICES division VIa as of February 2012. Any effort to utilise the 2012 fishing opportunities will result in an increased mortality upon any stock caught along with haddock, particularly for whiting and cod.
(9) As the main fishery for haddock occurs from February onwards, there is a need to introduce changes to prevent excessive discarding immediately.
(10) A continuation and increase of discards of the haddock stock will impact future recovery and production. Maximising fishing opportunities threatens the sustainability of other stocks. There is a danger of causing further crashes of these stocks as a result of high fishing mortality.
(11) The mismatch between landing requirements and unavoidable catches of haddock will increase substantially in 2012. It is therefore necessary to immediately suspend the catch composition rules as regards haddock to prevent a serious threat to the recovery of that species in waters to the west of Scotland and prevent additional fishing pressure on other stocks, while allowing for the rational use of 2012 fishing opportunities,","{'header': '24.2.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 52/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 161/2012\nof 23 February 2012\non emergency measures for the protection of haddock stocks in waters to the west of Scotland', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the common fisheries policy must provide for coherent measures concerning the conservation, management and exploitation of living aquatic resources, including specific measures to reduce the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems and non-target species.\n\n((2)) In order to protect the species cod, haddock and whiting, point 6.1 of Annex III to Council Regulation (EC) No 43/2009(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1288/2009(3), and Regulation (EU) No 579/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), establishes within ICES division VI a zone in which fishing activities are prohibited (hereafter referred to as the ‘waters to the west of Scotland’).\n\n((3)) By way of derogation from that prohibition, points 6.5 and 6.6 of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 allow respectively the fishing for nephrops and the fishing with trawls, demersal seines or similar gear, provided that certain conditions are met, and in particular the requirement that no more than a certain percentage of the retained catch be comprised of any mixture of cod, haddock and/or whiting.\n\n((4)) The purpose of that requirement was to reduce fishing mortality on the three stocks within their area of distribution, by preventing a targeted fisheries.\n\n((5)) Evidence and advice received by the Commission from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) highlighted that discarding was occurring as a result of the imposition of the catch composition rules in ICES division VIa.\n\n((6)) ICES identifies the haddock stock in ICES division VIa to be below safe biological limits, however ICES further identifies that recent stronger-than-average recruitment will contribute to an increase in the spawning stock biomass.\n\n((7)) The continued growth of these year classes means that these fish are now entering the fishery.

(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for the possibility of financial participation by the Community in the eradication and monitoring of animal diseases and for checks aimed at the prevention of zoonoses.
(2) Commission Decision 2002/799/EC(2) lists the programmes for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases and the programmes of checks aimed at the prevention of zoonoses qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2003. That Decision also sets out the proposed rate and maximum amount of the contribution for each programme.
(3) Commission Decision 2002/943/EC(3) approves the programmes listed in Decision 2002/799/EC and lays down the maximum amounts of the Community's financial contribution.
(4) The Commission has analysed the reports forwarded by the Member States on the expenditures of the programmes. The results of that analysis show that certain Member States will not utilise their full allocation for 2003 while others will spend in excess of the allocated amount.
(5) The Community's financial contribution to certain of those programmes therefore needs to be adjusted. It is appropriate to reallocate funding from programmes of Member States which are not using their full allocation to those that are exceeding it. The reallocation should be based on the most recent information on the expenditure actually incurred by the concerned Member States.

(1) Article 13(8) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the export refund applicable to cereals on the day on which application for an export licence is made must be applied on request to exports to be effected during the period of validity of the export licence.

amending Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 as regards the booking of imports of maize and sorghum and the communications to be made by the Member States concerned
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community undertook, as from the 1995/96 marketing year, to open reduced-tariff quotas (hereinafter abatimento quotas) for imports into Spain of two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum respectively and for imports into Portugal of 500 000 tonnes of maize. Detailed rules for the application of abatimento tariff quotas were laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 of 26 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of tariff quotas for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain and imports of maize into Portugal (2).
(2) To ensure the proper application of these quotas, the quantities of maize and of sorghum imported into Spain and Portugal are booked by the Commission on an annual basis taking account of all imports actually carried out, including imports of certain cereal substitute products which are deducted in proportion to the total quantities to be imported into Spain.
(3) In the case of maize imports, the import period for Portugal corresponds at present to the marketing year while it corresponds to the calendar year in the case of Spain. To ensure the sound management of the abatimento quotas, identical import and accounting periods should be fixed for those two countries, i.e. the calendar year. However, in order to avoid any overlap between the new and old accounting periods, a specific quota should be opened for Portugal for the second half of 2007. This Regulation must therefore apply from 1 July 2007.
(4) To ensure that the Community’s international commitments are met, an additional period should also be provided for, running beyond the calendar year, so enabling these commitments for each reference calendar year to be met. The length of this additional period must be the same for Spain and Portugal.
(5) Changes were made to the customs nomenclature in 2002 as regards certain substitute products to be booked against the abatimento quotas in Spain. CN codes 2308 90 30 (citrus pulp residues) and 2308 10 00 were merged. The products concerned now fall within CN code 2308 00 40. The list of products to be booked within the framework of abatimento quotas should therefore be adapted accordingly.
(6) Moreover, since the introduction of these quota arrangements, certain specific trade concessions for maize have been granted by the Community within the framework of both preferential and non-preferential arrangements. These new concessions apply independently of the abatimento quotas. They presently comprise the concessions granted by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regualtion (EC) No 2820/98 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 2/2000 (3), by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part (4), approved by Council and Commission Decision 2005/40/EC, Euratom (5), by the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Albania, of the other part (6), approved by Council Decision 2006/580/EC (7), and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 969/2006 of 29 June 2006 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for imports of maize from third countries (8).
(7) Accordingly, in order to ensure the sound management of the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1839/95, while continuing to observe the Community’s international obligations, the imports to be booked as abatimento quotas should be clearly specified.
(8) The current provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 provide for the extension of the period for booking imports into Spain to the end of February each year, but do not lay down any rules for Portugal. This situation is unsatisfactory as it creates uncertainty in the application of the arrangements. In order to remove this uncertainty and to ensure the sound management of the abatimento quotas, provision should be made for similar methods for booking imports of maize and sorghum effected in Spain and in Portugal.
(9) In order to attain this objective and to guarantee effective monitoring by the Commission of the arrangements and of the Community’s international obligations, provision should be made for Spain and Portugal to communicate to the Commission, each month, all imports of the products concerned actually carried out, specifying the calculation method applied.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'header': '30.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 138/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 583/2007\nof 29 May 2007\namending Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 as regards the booking of imports of maize and sorghum and the communications to be made by the Member States concerned', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community undertook, as from the 1995/96 marketing year, to open reduced-tariff quotas (hereinafterabatimentoquotas) for imports into Spain of two million tonnes of maize and 300\xa0000 tonnes of sorghum respectively and for imports into Portugal of 500\xa0000 tonnes of maize.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions, the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty and the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The French Government submitted to the Commission on 28 April 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the National Computerisation Programme, fulfilling the conditions for Objectives 1 and 2 pursuant to Articles 3(1) and 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 1 and 2 pursuant to Article 6(1) and (2) of that Regulation. The draft contains the information listed in Article 16 of the Regulation, and in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other financial instruments to be used to implement the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000, the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible is 1 January 2000. Under Article 30 of the Regulation, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the single programming document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.

(9) The EIB has been involved in drawing up the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and has declared itself prepared to contribute to its implementation in conformity with its statutory provisions.
(10) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market (1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Service providers whose services fall within the scope of Directive 2006/123/EC must be able to complete, through the Points of Single Contact and by electronic means, the procedures and formalities necessary for the access to and the exercise of their activities. Within the limits established in Article 5(3) of Directive 2006/123/EC, there may still be cases where service providers have to submit original documents, certified copies or certified translations when completing such procedures and formalities. In those cases, service providers may need to submit documents signed electronically by competent authorities.
(2) The cross-border use of advanced electronic signatures supported by a qualified certificate is facilitated through Commission Decision 2009/767/EC of 16 October 2009 setting out measures facilitating the use of procedures by electronic means through the ‘points of single contact’ under Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (2) which, inter alia, imposes an obligation on Member States to carry out risk assessments before requiring these electronic signatures from service providers and establishes rules for the acceptance by Member States of advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates, created with or without a secure signature creation device. However, Decision 2009/767/EC does not deal with formats of electronic signatures in documents issued by competent authorities, that need to be submitted by service providers when completing the relevant procedures and formalities.
(3) As competent authorities in Member States currently use different formats of advanced electronic signatures to sign their documents electronically, the receiving Member States that have to process these documents may face technical difficulties due to the variety of signature formats used. In order to allow service providers to complete their procedures and formalities across borders by electronic means, it is necessary to ensure that at least a number of advanced electronic signature formats can be technically supported by Member States when they receive documents signed electronically by competent authorities from other Member States. Defining a number of advanced electronic signature formats that need to be supported technically by the receiving Member State would allow greater automation and improve the cross-border interoperability of electronic procedures.
(4) Member States whose competent authorities use other electronic signature formats than those commonly supported, may have implemented validation means that allow their signatures to be verified also across borders. When this is the case and in order for the receiving Member States to be able to rely on these validation tools, it is necessary to make information on these tools available in an easily accessible way unless the necessary information is included directly in the electronic documents, in the electronic signatures or in the electronic document carriers.
(5) This Decision does not affect the determination by the Member States of what constitutes an original, a certified copy or a certified translation. Its objective is limited to facilitating the verification of electronic signatures if they are used in the originals, certified copies or certified translations that service providers may need to submit via the Points of Single Contact.
(6) For the purpose of allowing Member States to implement the necessary technical tools, it is appropriate that this Decision applies as of 1 August 2011.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 145 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas the European Council, at its recent meetings, confirmed that the fight against unemployment and the effort to achieve equal opportunities were the paramount tasks for the Community and its Member States;
Whereas, at its meeting on 9 and 10 December 1994 in Essen, the European Council identified priority areas for action to overcome structural employment problems; whereas it requested each Member State to incorporate these recommendations into a multiannual programme; whereas it invited the Council in the field of Labour and Social Affairs and Economic and Financial Affairs and the Commission to keep close track of employment trends, to monitor the relevant policies of the Member States and to report annually to the European Council on further progress on the employment market; whereas it asked at its meeting on 15 and 16 December 1995 in Madrid to establish as soon as possible the practical monitoring systems, including a system of common indicators;
Whereas the European Council at its meeting in Madrid urged Member States to apply in the framework of their multiannual employment programmes measures with particular emphasis on those categories requiring special attention, such as young people seeking their first job, the long-term unemployed and unemployed women;
Whereas the Council in the field of Economic and Financial Affairs is assisted by the Economic Policy Committee set up by Council Decision 74/122/EEC (2), in order to contribute to the coordination of the short and mid-term economic policies;
Whereas the Council in the field of Labour and Social Affairs has been assisted, thus far, by an ad hoc Working Party of the Representatives of Ministers for Labour and Employment set up on 27 March 1995;
Whereas, in order to ensure the continued success of the Community's strategy for employment and to facilitate the practical implementation of the employment monitoring procedure decided on in Essen, the European Council at its meeting in Madrid in December 1995 felt that it was necessary to establish, as soon as possible, a stable structure to assist the Council in the field of employment;
Whereas it is now appropriate for the Council to decide to set up an Employment and Labour Market Committee in the light of decisions taken by successive European Councils following publication of the White Paper on Growth, competitiveness and employment of 1993;
Whereas it is important to associate the social partners with future work in this field;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin. In particular, it provides that products of animal origin are only to be imported from a third country or part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists, account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of third countries, as regards compliance or equivalence with Union feed and food law and animal health rules as specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(3) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted (3) lists those third countries which satisfy the criteria referred to in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and are therefore able to guarantee that exports of those products to the Union meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Union legislation to protect the health of consumers. In particular, Annex II to that Decision sets out a list of third countries and territories from which imports of fishery products for human consumption are permitted. That list also indicates restrictions concerning such imports from certain third countries.
(4) Serbia is currently included in the list in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC as a third country from which imports of fishery products intended for human consumption are permitted, but such imports are restricted to whole fresh fish from wild seawater catches.
(5) Union controls to evaluate the control system in place in Serbia governing the production of fishery products intended for export to the Union, together with guarantees provided by the competent authority of Serbia, indicate that the conditions applicable in that third country to fishery products for human consumption destined for export to the Union are equivalent to those laid down in the relevant Union legislation. Accordingly, Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC should be amended in order to permit imports from Serbia of fishery products for human consumption, but not subject to the current restriction.
(6) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,",{'header': '7.10.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 264/17'}

(1) On 30 April 1999 the President of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities issued an order in Case T-44/98 RII (Emesa Sugar (Free Zone) NV (hereinafter referred to as ""Emesa"") v Commission of the European Communities) suspending the application, as regards Emesa, of Article 108b of Council Decision 91/482/EEC on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Economic Community(1), as last amended by Decision 97/803/EC(2) (hereinafter referred to as the ""OCT Decision""), of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2553/97 of 17 December 1997 on rules for issuing import licences for certain products covered by CN codes 1701, 1702, 1703 and 1704 and qualifying as ACP/OCT originating products(3), and of the Commission Decision of 23 December 1997 (VI/51329)(4), (hereinafter referred to as the ""Order"").
(2) The Order authorised Emesa until 31 October 1999 to import ground sugar originating in the OCTs in accordance with Article 6 of Annex II to Decision 91/482/EEC, on the conditions set out in that Decision as it applied up to 30 November 1997 and subject to certain requirements and restrictions.
(3) In order to enable Emesa to carry out the transactions for which it was authorised under the Order, the Commission adopted Decision 1999/422/EC of 24 June 1999 laying down measures for the application of the Order of the President of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities of 30 April 1999 in Case T-44/98 RII(5).
(4) Sugar importation authorised by the Order covers the period up to 31 October 1999. Before that date the Court of Justice handed down no judgment in Case C-17/98 concerning the legality of Article 108b of the OCT Decision. At Emesa's request, on 29 September 1999 the President of the Court of First Instance delivered a new Order (hereinafter referred to as the ""second order"") authorising Emesa to import a further quantity of ground sugar originating in the OCTs in accordance with Article 6 of Annex II to the OCT Decision over the period 31 October 1999 to 29 February 2000, on the conditions set out in that Decision as it applied up to 30 November 1997 and subject to certain requirements and restrictions.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 23 October 1984
accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of paraformaldehyde originating in Spain and terminating the investigation
(84/512/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In April 1984 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) on behalf of producers representing all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of paraformaldehyde falling within subheading 29.11 G of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code 29.11-97, originating in Spain and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporter and importers known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) All of the known Community producers, exporter and importers made their views known in writing. None of them requested a hearing.
(4) No submissions were made by or on behalf of Community purchasers of paraformaldehyde.
(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
(1) EEC producers:
- Organichim SA (CDF - Chimie group), Paris, France,
- Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Synthite Ltd, West Bromwich, United Kingdom,
- Alder SpA, Trieste, Italy;
(b) exporter:
- Formol y Derivados SA, Barcelona, Spain;
(c) EEC importer:
- Chimilux SA, Paris, France.
(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 June 1983 to 31 May 1984.
B. Normal value
(7) Normal value was provisionally determined on the basis of the domestic prices of the Spanish producer who exported to the Community and who provided sufficient evidence concerning sales to unrelated customers.
C. Export price
(8) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid for the product sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(9) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences in conditions and terms of sale affecting price comparability and allowances were made for differences in credit terms, commissions and transport.
(10) A request was made by the exporter for an adjustment to take account of a price differential resulting from a price discount for quantity sales given to the main customer on the Spanish domestic market. The Commission granted this request with regard to the qualities concerned since the conditions laid down in Article 2 (10) (b) (i) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 were considered to be fulfilled.
(11) Furthermore, a request was made by the exporter for an adjustment to take account of the fact that quantities exported to the Community had been considerably larger than those sold on the Spanish domestic market. The Commission refused this claim for an adjustment on the grounds that the exporter did not prove that savings were made in the cost of producing different quantities exported as is provided for under Article 2 (10) (b) (ii) of the above Regulation.
(12) The Spanish exporter also requested the Commission on the basis of Article 2 (10) (d) of the above Regulation to take account of the export tax rebate ('Desgravaciรณn fiscal'), being the refund by the Spanish authorities of an amount corresponding to the taxes incurred during the production process, when the product concerned was exported. However, without prejudice to the question whether and to what extent this claim could be taken into consideration, the Commission did not grant this request, since the Spanish exporter did not submit satisfactory evidence concerning the amount of taxes refunded by the Spanish authorities with regard to the exports of the product concerned.
Furthermore, the question whether the tax rebate constitutes an export subsidy could only be examined if a complaint were lodged concerning the subsidy and a proceeding initiated accordingly.
(13) All comparisons were made at ex-works level.
E. Margin
(14) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of the Spanish exporter, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. The weighted average margin amounts to 17,4 %.
F. Injury
(15) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Spain of paraformaldehyde increased from 853 tonnes 1980 to 2 776 tonnes in 1982. In 1983 these imports increased to 3 392 tonnes and during the first five months of 1984 they amounted to 1 461 tonnes which corresponds to 3 506 tonnes on an annual basis.
(16) The development of these imports represents an increase in market share held by the exporting country from 3,4 % to 11,2 % between 1980 and 1982. Furthermore, it represents a further increase of the market share to 12,9 % in 1983; the market share achieved subsequently for the first five months of 1984 is estimated to have been 11,3 %.
(17) The resale prices of the dumped imports undercut the prices of the Community producers during the investigation period by 18 %.
(18) The consequent impact on the Community industry concerned has been a reduction of production and of sales within the Community of 2 % and 9,5 % respectively between 1980 and 1982. This development corresponds to a decrease in the market share of the Community producers from 96,2 % to 88,5 % in the same period, as opposed to the increase in the market share held by the dumped imports. (19) It has been argued that in 1983 and during the first five months of 1984 production and sales of the Community producers increased. However, this was due more to their sales outside the Community than on the Community market. Moreover, despite this increase, the market share held by the Community producers dropped further to 85,9 % in 1983. During the first five months of 1984 their market share is estimated to have increased, but not enough to compensate for the loss suffered in 1983.
(20) Most of the Community producers have also suffered significant price depression, which made it impossible to increase their sales prices in order to cover their increased costs of production. Some of them had to lower their sales prices.
(21) Since 1980 the profit and loss situation of most of the Community producers developed in a negative way, although some improvement seems to have taken place since the beginning of 1984.
(22) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as the development of the consumption of this product. In this respect the Commission found that, whilst consumption in the Community dropped by 1,4 % between 1980 and 1982, the market share of the imported products rose by 7,8 %, whereas the market share of the Community producers decreased by 7,7 % during the same period. Therefore, the decline in consumption during this period is considered to have affected the Community producers but not the imported products. Furthermore, although consumption in the Community increased by 6,6 % in 1983, the market share held by the Community producers further declined, whilst there was a further increase of the market share held by the dumped imports.
The volume of the dumped imports, their market share and the prices at which they are offered for sale in the Community led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of paraformaldehyde originating in Spain taken in isolation have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interests
(23) The Spanish exporter argued that it is not in the Community's interest that action be taken, since it would only serve to protect Community producers with a less efficient technology and production process. However, if action is to be taken, it would not be aimed at protecting Community producers against more efficient producers in third countries, but it would serve as a protection against unfair competition from an exporter who sold his products in the Community at dumped prices and who caused material injury to the Community industry concerned.
(24) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken.
H. Undertaking
(25) The exporter concerned was informed of the main findings of the provisional investigation and commented on them. An undertaking was subsequently offered by Formol y Derivados SA concerning their exports of paraformaldehyde to the Community.
The effect of said undertaking will be to increase prices to the Community to the level necessary to eliminate the dumping. The weighted average of this increase in no case exceeds the weighted average dumping margin found in the investigation.
In these circumstances the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the investigation may therefore be terminated without imposition of an anti-dumping duty.
(26) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': '84/512/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 October 1984 accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of paraformaldehyde originating in Spain and terminating the investigation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking given by Formol y Derivados SA, Barcelona in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of paraformaldehyde falling within subheading 29.11 G of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code 29.11-97 and originating in Spain is hereby accepted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe investigation in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding referred to in Article 1 is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 October 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nAntonio GIOLITTI\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No C 145, 1. 6. 1984, p. 7.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1265/95 (2), and in particular Articles 5a (4) (f) and 5b (4) thereof,
Whereas the implementation, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1847/95 (4), of the rules on individual limits introduced by Article 5a of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 resulted, during the 1995 marketing year, in administrative difficulties in the United Kingdom which delayed the allocation of the national reserve for the said marketing year; whereas, consequently, certain producers were not able to effect the transfers of rights or temporary leases provided for in Article 5a (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 within the time limits provided for in Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 for the 1995 marketing year; whereas the Member State concerned should therefore be authorized, on certain conditions designed to limit the risk of irregularities as far as possible, to set a second deadline for notification by the producers concerned of such transfers or temporary leasing of rights for the 1995 marketing year;
Whereas the administrative difficulties in question are also likely to affect the mechanisms set up for transfers and temporary leasing of rights in respect of the 1996 marketing year; whereas, therefore, it should also be laid down that the Member State in question may set a second deadline for certain transfers and temporary leases in respect of the 1996 marketing year under the conditions referred to above;
Whereas the application of the special reserve with a ceiling of 600 000 rights each for Italy and Greece, introduced by Article 5b (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2134/95 (5) leads to the creation of additional rights to the ewe and she-goat premium for certain producers as from the 1995 marketing year; whereas the said rights have been allocated according to the eligible livestock numbers held during the 1991 and 1992 marketing years by those producers; whereas the composition of the flocks held by the said producers may have changed substantially since those marketing years; whereas transfers or temporary leasing of the newly created additional rights should therefore be authorized; whereas Italy and Greece should therefore be authorized to set a second deadline for the notification by the producers concerned of the said transfers or temporary lease of rights in respect of the 1995 and 1996 marketing years;
Whereas, for the same reasons, Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom should be authorized, as a special measure for the 1995 and 1996 marketing years, to extend the deadline provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 for the notification of transfers of premium rights and temporary leasing of those rights;
Whereas the setting of a second deadline for the notification of transfers or temporary leasing of rights under the conditions referred to above also makes it necessary to derogate from the provisions laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92 in respect of the 1995, 1996 and 1997 marketing years for Italy, Greece and the United Kingdom;

of 12 December 2011
on the reuse of Commission documents
(2011/833/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 249 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Europe 2020 sets out a vision of Europe’s social market economy for the 21st century. One of the priority themes in that context is ‘Smart growth: developing an economy based on knowledge and innovation’.
(2) The new information and communication technologies have created unprecedented possibilities to aggregate and combine content from different sources.
(3) Public sector information is an important source of potential growth of innovative online services through value-added products and services. Governments can stimulate content markets by making public sector information available on transparent, effective and non-discriminatory terms. For this reason, the Digital Agenda for Europe (1) singled out the reuse of public sector information as one of the key areas for action.
(4) The Commission and the other Institutions are themselves holders of many documents of all kinds which could be reused in added-value information products and services and which could provide a useful content resource for companies and citizens alike.
(5) The right to access Commission documents is regulated through Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (2).
(6) Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) sets minimum rules for the reuse of public sector information throughout the European Union. In its recitals it encourages Member States to go beyond these minimum rules and to adopt open data policies, allowing a broad use of documents held by public sector bodies.
(7) The Commission has set an example to public administrations in making statistics, publications and the full corpus of Union law freely available online. This is a good basis to make further progress in ensuring the availability and reusability of data held by the institution.
(8) Commission Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom of 7 April 2006 on the reuse of Commission information (4) determines the conditions for the reuse of Commission documents.
(9) In order to make the reuse regime of Commission documents more effective, the rules on the reuse of Commission documents should be adapted with a view to achieving a broader reuse of such documents.
(10) A data portal as a single point of access to documents available for reuse should be set up. In addition, it is appropriate to include in the documents available for reuse the research information produced by the Joint Research Centre. A provision should be adopted to take into account the move towards machine-readable formats. An important improvement with respect to Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom consists in making Commission documents generally available for reuse without the need for individual applications, through open reuse licences or simple disclaimers.
(11) Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom should therefore be replaced by this Decision.
(12) An open reuse policy at the Commission will support new economic activity, lead to a wider use and spread of Union information, enhance the image of openness and transparency of the Institutions, and avoid unnecessary administrative burden for users and Commission services. In 2012, the Commission envisages exploring with other Union institutions and key Agencies to what extent they could adopt their own rules on reuse.
(13) This Decision should be implemented and applied in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5).
(14) This Decision should not apply to documents for which the Commission is not in a position to allow reuse, e.g. in view of third party intellectual property rights or where the documents have been received from the other Institutions,","{'header': '14.12.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 330/39', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 12 December 2011\non the reuse of Commission documents\n(2011/833/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Europe 2020 sets out a vision of Europe’s social market economy for the 21st century.

This is a good basis to make further progress in ensuring the availability and reusability of data held by the institution.\n\n((8)) Commission Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom of 7 April 2006 on the reuse of Commission information(4)determines the conditions for the reuse of Commission documents.\n\n((9)) In order to make the reuse regime of Commission documents more effective, the rules on the reuse of Commission documents should be adapted with a view to achieving a broader reuse of such documents.\n\n((10)) A data portal as a single point of access to documents available for reuse should be set up. In addition, it is appropriate to include in the documents available for reuse the research information produced by the Joint Research Centre. A provision should be adopted to take into account the move towards machine-readable formats. An important improvement with respect to Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom consists in making Commission documents generally available for reuse without the need for individual applications, through open reuse licences or simple disclaimers.\n\n((11)) Decision 2006/291/EC, Euratom should therefore be replaced by this Decision.\n\n((12)) An open reuse policy at the Commission will support new economic activity, lead to a wider use and spread of Union information, enhance the image of openness and transparency of the Institutions, and avoid unnecessary administrative burden for users and Commission services. In 2012, the Commission envisages exploring with other Union institutions and key Agencies to what extent they could adopt their own rules on reuse.\n\n((13)) This Decision should be implemented and applied in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data(5).\n\n((14)) This Decision should not apply to documents for which the Commission is not in a position to allow reuse, e.g. in view of third party intellectual property rights or where the documents have been received from the other Institutions,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter\nThis Decision determines the conditions for the reuse of documents held by the Commission or on its behalf by the Publications Office of the European Union (the Publications Office) with the aim of facilitating a wider reuse of information, enhancing the image of openness of the Commission, and avoiding unnecessary administrative burdens for reusers and the Commission services alike.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Scope', 'text': 'Article 2\nScope\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision applies to public documents produced by the Commission or by public and private entities on its behalf:\n(a)\nwhich have been published by the Commission or by the Publications Office on its behalf through publications, websites or dissemination tools; or\n(b)\nwhich have not been published for economic or other practical reasons, such as studies, reports and other data.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision shall not apply:\n(a)\nto software or to documents covered by industrial property rights such as patents, trademarks, registered designs, logos and names;\n(b)\nto documents for which the Commission is not in a position to allow their reuse in view of intellectual property rights of third parties;\n(c)\nto documents which pursuant to the rules established in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 are excluded from access or only made accessible to a party under specific rules governing privileged access;\n(d)\nto confidential data, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(\n6\n)\n;\n(e)\nto documents resulting from ongoing research projects conducted by the staff of the Commission which are not published or available in a published database, and whose reuse would interfere with the validation of provisional research results or where reuse would constitute a reason to refuse registration of industrial property rights in the Commission’s favour.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision is without prejudice to and in no way affects Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Nothing in this Decision authorises reuse of documents in a manner calculated to deceive or to defraud.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) Norway was designated as Rapporteur and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 8 September 2008 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 16 December 2010, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one in Annex I to that Directive.
(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(7) In view of the risks identified for human health, it is appropriate to require that safe operational procedures are established for products authorised for industrial or professional use, and that those products are used with appropriate personal protective equipment unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to industrial or professional users can be reduced to an acceptable level by other means.
(8) In view of the risks identified for the aquatic and terrestrial compartments, it is appropriate to require that freshly treated timber is stored after treatment under shelter or on impermeable hard standing, or both, and that any losses from the application of products used as wood preservatives and containing 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one are collected for reuse or disposal.
(9) Unacceptable risks for the environment were identified in various scenarios for in-service use of treated wood not covered and not in contact with the ground, which is either continually exposed to the weather or protected from the weather but subject to frequent wetting (use class 3 as defined by OECD (3)) and wood in contact with fresh water (use class 4b as defined by OECD (4)). It is therefore appropriate to require that products are not authorised for the treatment of wood intended for those uses, unless data is submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of both Article 5 of and Annex VI to Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.
(10) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(12) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(13) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '2.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 175/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2011/66/EU\nof 1 July 2011\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include 4,5-Dichloro-2-octyl-2H-isothiazol-3-one as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1196/76 of 17 May 1976 laying down general rules for the granting of compensation to producers of tuna for the canning industry (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas the detailed rules for granting the compensatory allowance were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2469/86 of 31 July 1986 laying down detailed rules for the granting of compensation to producers of tuna for the canning industry (4);
Whereas compensation is to be granted, if necessary, to Community producers of tuna in respect of tuna for the canning industry; whereas this measure was included in order to compensate Community producers for any disadvantages that may arise under the import arrangements; whereas by virtue of those arrangements a fall in the import prices for tuna could directly threaten the income level of Community producers of this product;
Whereas compensation is granted for the quantities of tuna supplied to the canning industry during the three-month period for which prices were recorded, where simultaneously the quarterly average price on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price are less than 90 % of the Community producer price and this fall in prices is occasioned by the level of prices on the world market in tuna and is not caused by an abnormal increase in the quantities produced by Community producers and landed in the Community;
Whereas, since the application of these arrangements to Spain and Portugal was postponed until 1 March 1986 in accordance with Article 394 of the Act of Accession, the situation on the markets in those two Member States can be assessed only on the basis of information covering each three-month period from 1 March 1986; whereas from 1 January 1987 orwards the analysis of the compensation file for tuna should be made for the Community as a whole and with the same periodicity, the application of this method for the 1986 fishing year makes it necessary, exceptionally, to consider the period from 1 September to 31 December 1986 as the third three- month period from 1 March 1986; whereas the market situation in Spain and Portugal should therefore be assessed on the basis of the situation prevailing from the second three-month period following that date and the maximum amount of the compensation fixed, where appropriate, for the period commencing on 1 September 1986;
Whereas an analysis of the situation on the market in tuna in Spain has shown that for certain species and presentations of the product considered, during the period 1 September to 31 December of the 1986 fishing year, both the quarterly average market price and the entry price referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1196/76 were less than 90 % of the Community producer price in force, as fixed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3605/85 of 17 December 1985 fixing the Community producer price for tuna intended for the canning industry for the 1986 fishing year (5);
Whereas the information currently available to the Commission does not suggest that the current level of prices on the Community market in Spain is caused by an abnormal increase in the quantities of Spanish production landed in the Community;
Whereas compensation should therefore be granted, for the period 1 September to 31 December 1986, to tuna producers established in Spain and the maximum amount of compensation for each of the products concerned should be fixed within the limits necessary to ensure that the fall in prices on the Community market does not threaten the income derived by producers of the products from the sale of the quantities produced, be it on the Community market or on that of third countries; whereas in order to assess the actual fall in income on the basis of available data, reference should be made to trends over a sufficiently representative period by means of appropriate criteria; whereas this maximum amount is fixed on the basis of data which, in the immediate future, of necessity reflect a situation which is fragmentary because limited to only part of the fishing year and as the year progresses it
will be necessary to take into account all the factors contributing to a more complete assessment of the situation;

Whereas, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3815/89 (2), lays down detailed rules for the application of the compensation mechanism to imports of fruit and vegetables from Spain;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 152 of the Act of Accession, a compensation mechanism is to be introduced on imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, hereinafter referred to as 'the Community of Ten', from 1 January 1990, of fruit and vegetables from Spain for which a reference price is fixed with regard to third countries; whereas, Community offer prices for lemons coming from Spain should be fixed only during the period where reference prices are fixed with regard to third countries, this means from 1 June up to and including 31 May of the following year;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 152 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each Member State of the Community of Ten, plus transport and packaging costs incurred by the products from the producton regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and bearing in mind developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetable sector; whereas the abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied for third countries;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal variations in prices, the marketing year should be divided into one or more periods and a Community offer price should be fixed for each of them;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3709/89, the producer prices to be used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product defined by its commercial characteristics recorded on the representative market or markets located in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter and which meet quality class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive variations with respect of normal price fluctuations it shall not be taken into account;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 784/90 of 29 March 1990 fixing the reducing coefficient for agricultural prices in the 1990/91 marketing year as a result of the monetary realignment of 5 January 1990 and amending the prices and amounts fixed in ecus for that marketing year (3) establishes the list of prices and amounts to which the coefficient 1,001712 is applied in the framework of the arrangements on the automatic dismantlement of negative monetary gaps; whereas the prices and amounts fixed in ecus by the Commission for the 1990/91 marketing year must take account of the resulting reduction;
Whereas this reducing coefficient shall apply to the prices referred to above; whereas this adjustment shall enter into force on the day of entry into force of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1179/90 (4) fixing the agricultural conversion rates;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices being fixed for lemons for the period 1 June 1990 to 31 May 1991 at the levels set out hereinafter;

BECKETT\n\n(1) OJ L 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1.\n\nANNEX\n\nSLOVENIA\n\n1. Objectives\n\nThe purpose of the accession partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's opinion on Slovenia's application for membership of the European Union, the financial means available to help Slovenia implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The accession partnership will provide a framework for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate countries in their preparations for membership. These will include inter alia the national programme for the adoption of the acquis to be adopted by Slovenia, the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, the pact against organised crime and the internal market road maps. Each of these instruments is different in nature and will be prepared and implemented according to specific procedures. They will not be an integral part of this partnership, but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it.\n\n2. Principles\n\nThe main priority areas identified for each candidate country relate to their ability to assume the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires:\n\n- that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities,\n\n- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union,\n\n- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.\n\nAt its meeting in Madrid, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate countries to adjust their administrative structures to ensure the harmonious operation of Community policies after accession and at Luxembourg, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.\n\n3. Priorities and intermediate objectives\n\nThe Commission's opinions and the Council's examination of these have highlighted the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate countries to prepare for accession and took the view that none of these countries fully satisfies all of the Copenhagen criteria at the present time. This situation will require the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the countries concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. The priorities and intermediate objectives have been divided into two groups - short and medium term. Those listed under the short-term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Slovenia can complete or take them substantially forward by the end of 1998. In view of the short time span, and taking into account the administrative capacity required to achieve them, the number of priorities selected for the short term has been limited. The priorities listed under the medium term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work may and should also begin on them during 1998.\n\nSlovenia will be invited to draw up a national programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA) by the end of March which should set out a timetable for achieving these priorities and intermediate objectives and, where possible and relevant, indicate the necessary staff and financial resources.\n\nThe accession partnership will indicate that Slovenia will have to address all issues identified in the opinion. Incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis.\n\nDrawing on the analysis of the Commission's opinion and the Council's examination of this, the following short- and medium-term priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Slovenia.\n\n3.1. Short-term (1998)\n\nEconomic reform: establishment of medium-term economic policy priorities and joint assessment within the framework of the Interim/Cooperation Agreement; action on market-driven restructuring in the enterprise, finance and banking sectors and preparation of pension reform.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: in particular introduction of a civil service act, improvements in the areas of the judiciary, of land registration, phytosanitary and veterinary administration, particularly as regards facilities at the external borders, financial control and audit functions, institutional strengthening in the area of environment, begin to set up structures needed for regional and structural policy.\n\nInternal market: including alignment in the areas of indirect taxation, intellectual and industrial property, adoption of VAT law and preparation for implementation in 1999, standardisation and certification (conformity assessment), technical regulations, and of company legislation and liberalisation of capital movements (in particular currency legislation), establishment of a State aid monitoring authority, a first State aid inventory and the creation of a legal framework for State aid control, progress towards adoption of an anti-trust law.\n\nProperty law: further clarification of the situation pertaining to property legislation with particular regard to the right to purchase property for Union citizens.\n\nEnvironment: continue transposition of framework legislation, finalising the detailed approximation programmes and implementation strategies related to individual acts. Planning and commencement of implementation of these programmes and strategies.\n\n3.2. Medium-term\n\nPolitical criteria: pursue efforts to speed up property restitution.\n\nEconomic policy: regular review of the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, within the Europe Agreement framework, focusing on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria for membership of the Union and the acquis in the area of economic and monetary policy (coordination of economic policies, submission of convergence programmes, avoidance of excessive deficits); while Slovenia is not expected to adopt the euro immediately on accession, it is expected to pursue policies which aim to achieve real convergence in accordance with the Union's objectives of economic and social cohesion, and nominal convergence compatible with the ultimate goal of adoption of the euro.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: as regards public procurement (in particular transparency), supervision of the insurance and security market, the Slovene Competition Office, completion of competition law, development and implementation of agricultural and regional policies, audiovisual policies, customs administration and enforcement of the customs code; improved operation of the judicial system; training for the judiciary in Community law and its application, reinforcement of justice and home affairs institutions (ensuring sufficient and properly trained personnel, in particular police, border guards, ministries and courts), strengthening of the nuclear safety authority, reform of customs and tax administrations to ensure readiness to apply the acquis, the reinforcement of food control administration.\n\nInternal market: including the alignment of legislation on public procurement, financial services, State aid (in particular alignment of monitoring rules and exclusive and special rights), upgrading of standardisation and conformity assessment structures, establishment of a market surveillance system and alignment of horizontal technical legislation on industrial products, increased efforts to liberalise the capital market and to facilitate foreign investments, further alignment of consumer protection, reinforcement of the competition office and the State aid monitoring authority, efficient enforcement of competition law, promotion of enterprise development, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alignment with the acquis in the fields of telecommunications, consumer protection and the internal energy market.\n\nJustice and home affairs: fight against organised crime (in particular money laundering, drugs and trafficking in human beings) and corruption, alignment of visa policy with that of the Union and completion of alignment on international conventions, implementation of migration policy and asylum procedures, notably in view of the Schengen acquis.\n\nNuclear safety: nuclear policy and investment plans to be adjusted in line with the results of the seismic risk assessment to be carried out in the surroundings of the Krsko NPP.\n\nAgriculture: establishment of a functioning land registry, strengthening of structural and rural development policy, including alignment with the agricultural acquis (including veterinary and phytosanitary matters, in particular external border controls), attention to environmental aspects of agriculture and biodiversity. Development of the capacity to implement and enforce the common agricultural policy (CAP), in particular the fundamental management mechanisms and administrative structures to monitor the agricultural markets and implement structural and rural development measures, adoption and implementation of the veterinary and phytosanitary requirements, upgrading of certain food-processing establishments and testing and diagnostic facilities, restructuring of the agri-food sector.\n\nFisheries: development of capacity to implement and enforce the common fisheries policy.\n\nTransport: further efforts on alignment with the acquis, in particular on road transport (market access, safety rules and taxation) and rail, and to provide necessary investment for transport infrastructure, notably extension of trans-European networks.\n\nEmployment and social affairs: development of appropriate labour-market structures and joint review of employment policies as preparation for participation in Union coordination; alignment of labour and occupational health and safety legislation and development of enforcement structures in particular early adoption of the framework directive on health and safety at work; enforcement of equal opportunities between women and men; further development of active, autonomous social dialogue; further development of social protection.\n\nEnvironment: including the development of monitoring and implementation control structures and capacities, continuous planning and implementation of approximation programmes related to individual legal acts. A particular emphasis should be given to air pollution, the waste water sector as well as integrated industrial pollution control and risk management. Environmental protection requirements and the need for sustainable development must be integrated into the definition and implementation of national, sectoral policies.\n\nRegional policy and cohesion: introduce the legal administrative and budgetary framework for a national policy to address regional disparities through an integrated approach, in order to participate in Union structural programmes after membership.\n\n4. Programming\n\nThe PHARE allocation for the period 1995 to 1997 has totalled ECU 72 million. Subject to the approval of the PHARE budget for the remaining period, the Commission will confirm the allocations for 1998 and 1999. Financial proposals will be submitted to the PHARE Management Committee as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89. Joint financing by the applicant countries will be systematically required for all investment projects. Financial assistance from the year 2000 onwards will comprise aid for agriculture and a structural instrument which will give priority to measures similar to the Cohesion Fund.\n\n5. Conditionality\n\nCommunity assistance will be conditional on respect by Slovenia of its commitments under the Europe Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and progress in implementing this accession partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.\n\n6. Monitoring\n\nThe implementation of the accession partnership will be monitored in the framework of the Europe Agreement. This will begin in 1998 before the Commission presents its first regular report to the Council reviewing the progress made by Slovenia including implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe relevant sections of the accession partnership will be discussed in the appropriate sub-committee. The Association Committee will discuss overall developments, progress and problems in meeting its priorities and intermediate objectives as well as more specific issues referred to it from the sub-committees. The Association Committee will report to the Association Council on the implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe PHARE Management Committee will ensure that financing decisions are compatible with the accession partnerships.\n\nThe accession partnership will be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98. The Commission will propose, before the end of 1999 and at regular intervals thereafter, a review of this partnership, on which the Council will take a formal decision. These reviews will include consideration of the need to further specify intermediate objectives in the light of the progress made by Slovenia in meeting the objectives set out in this partnership.""}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION of 9 September 1981 on a proposal by the Netherlands Government to grant aid for investment by an electrical and electronics engineering firm (Only the Dutch text is authentic) (81/767/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments and having regard to these comments,
I
Whereas Article 6 of the Netherlands law of 29 June 1978 (Wet Investeringsrekening - WIR) (1) on the promotion and guidance of investment introduced an ""additional premium for major schemes"" for the benefit of projects where investment exceeds Fl 30 million. The amount of the premium depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question.
When examining the Netherlands Law at the draft stage, in the course of the procedure under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that since the ""additional premium for major schemes"" involved no sectoral or regional objectives it therefore constituted a general aid system, and that since the arrangements applied to all investment, without distinction by reference to given undertakings, regions or sectors, they could not qualify for the derogations under Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). In the absence of such specification, the Commission could not assess the system's effects on trade between Member States and on competition and therefore assess its compatibility with the common market.
In respect of such general aid systems it is now the well-established policy of the Commission to accept them subject to one of two conditions, namely, that the Member State concerned notifies to the Commission either a plan for regional or sectoral application or, alternatively, where this is felt not to be possible, significant individual cases of application.
In line with this approach, and in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission requested prior notification in good time of individual cases of application of the ""additional premium for major schemes"", account being taken of the amount of investment concerned.
During discussions with the Netherlands authorities, the Commission stated that it would assess each case on its own merits in the light of the rules contained in Article 92 et seq. or rules developed during administration of those provisions. The Netherlands Government could not infer that, by requesting regular prior notification, the Commission had taken a favourable view of the additional premium system.
The Netherlands Government complied with the Commission's request by including the prior notification procedure in Articles 6 (7) and 7 (3) of Chapter V of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978.
II
By letters dated 6, 10 and 12 April 1979 the Netherlands Government notified the Commission, as required by the procedure, of its intention to grant the additional premium for major schemes to an international electrical and electronics engineering firm.
The aid was to be granted to the firm to help modernize administrative buildings, replace power plant and build a new laboratory. The investment would not create any new jobs.
Total investment was estimated at Fl 284 73 million and the scheme would qualify for a Fl 11 74 million subsidy by way of the additional premium for major schemes under the WIR scheme. On account of its location in the Eindhoven area, the project does not qualify for regional aid.  (1) Staatsblad 1978, No 368.
The group, of which the company in question is a part, already operates at Eindhoven and regards the investment - replacing out-of-date equipment and improving the group's research capacity - as a profitable undertaking.
III
The Netherlands Government replied on 27 July 1979 to the Commission's notice under Article 93 of the EEC Treaty stressing that the WIR scheme operated automatically, that aid could not be granted selectively in accordance with the desirability of the investment concerned and that the large amount of investment involved created financing problems even for a major group, notably on account of the investment which it had to make in order to remain competitive on a rapidly evolving market.
In the course of consultations with interested parties the Government of a Member State expressed reservations about the proposed aid. The firm concerned stressed that the investment envisaged would help to improve research capacity and productivity in certain areas.
IV
The aid proposed by the Netherlands Government is therefore liable to affect trade between Member States and to distort of threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty by favouring the undertaking in question or the production of its goods.
Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty provides that, in principle, any aid fulfilling the criteria which it sets out is incompatible with the common market. The derogations from this principle set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty specify objectives pursued in the Community interest and not in that of the individual recipient of the aid. These derogations must be strictly interpreted in the examination both of any regional or sectoral aid scheme and of any individual case of application of general aid systems. In particular, they may be applied only where the Commission establish that, in the absence of the aid, the free play of market forces would not of itself induce the recipient undertakings to act in such a manner as to contribute to the attainment of one of the objectives specified by those derogations.
To derogate in this way in favour of aids offering no compensatory benefit would be tantamount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification in terms of the interest of the Community, while at the same time granting undue advantages to certain Member States.
When applying the principles set out above in its examination of individual cases of application of general aid systems, the Commission must be satisfied that there exists on the part of the recipient undertaking a specific compensatory justification in that the grant of aid is required to promote the attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty. Where this cannot be demonstrated, and especially where the proposed investment nevertheless takes place, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to the attainment of the objective of the derogations but serves to increase the financial power of the undertaking in question.
In the case in question there does not appear to be such a compensatory justification on the part of the recipient of the aid.
The Netherlands Government has not been able to give, nor has the Commission found, any grounds to establish that the proposed aid meets the conditions justifying one of the derogations for which provision is made in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
As regards the derogations of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) of the EEC Treaty concerning aid to promote or to facilitate the development of certain areas, it cannot be considered that the standard of living in the Eindhoven area is ""abnormally low"" or that it suffers from ""serious under-employment"" within the meaning of subparagraph (a). As regards the derogation of subparagraph (c), the Netherlands Government has not included that area amongst those requiring special regional development aid. The Netherlands Government has not included that area amongst those requiring special regional development aid. The Netherlands Government, in its comments submitted to the Commission, itself emphasized that the ""additional premium for major schemes"" was not granted on account of regional considerations.
In respect of the derogations envisaged in Article 92 (3) (b) of the EEC Treaty, investment of this type is brought about in a general way by normal market forces. Moreover, there is nothing peculiar to the investment in question to qualify it as a project of common European interest or as one designed to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, the promotion of which merits a derogation under Article 92 (3) (b) of the EEC Treaty from the principle of the incompatibility of aids laid down by Article 92 (1). In stating its views on the WIR, the Commission recalled that the Netherlands are part of the Community's central regions. These regions are not suffering from the most serious economic and social problems in the Community but they are the regions where there is a real risk of an upward spiral of aids, and where any aid is likely, more than  elsewhere, to affect trade between Member States. Furthermore, the information available on the socio-economic situation in that country does not point to the conclusion that it is suffering from a serious disturbance in its economy within the meaning of the Treaty. In individual cases of application the ""additional premium for major projects"" is not granted for the purpose of dealing with such a situation.
To take any other view would enable the Netherlands, in the present climate of slow growth and high unemployment throughout the Community, to divert to their advantage investment which might be made in other, less well-placed, Member States. Recent social and economic trends in the Community justify maintaining this approach as regards both the scheme itself and possible cases of application.
Finally, as regards the derogation provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) in favour of ""aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities"", scrutiny of the electrical and electronics engineering industry as a whole gives reason to conclude that the play of market forces should itself be capable, without State intervention, of ensuring a normal development of this activity ; in the present case the objective is essentially to facilitate investment for the replacement and updating of production and research facilities which are in the interests of the firm itself.
In view of the foregoing, the abovementioned aid proposed by the Netherlands Government does not fulfil the conditions necessary for it to benefit from any of the derogations referred to in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '81/767/EEC: Commission Decision of 9 September 1981 on a proposal by the Netherlands Government to grant aid for investment by an electrical and electronics engineering firm (Only the Dutch text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty provides that, in principle, any aid fulfilling the criteria which it sets out is incompatible with the common market.

Where this cannot be demonstrated, and especially where the proposed investment nevertheless takes place, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to the attainment of the objective of the derogations but serves to increase the financial power of the undertaking in question.\n\nIn the case in question there does not appear to be such a compensatory justification on the part of the recipient of the aid.\n\nThe Netherlands Government has not been able to give, nor has the Commission found, any grounds to establish that the proposed aid meets the conditions justifying one of the derogations for which provision is made in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.\n\nAs regards the derogations of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) of the EEC Treaty concerning aid to promote or to facilitate the development of certain areas, it cannot be considered that the standard of living in the Eindhoven area is ""abnormally low"" or that it suffers from ""serious under-employment"" within the meaning of subparagraph (a). As regards the derogation of subparagraph (c), the Netherlands Government has not included that area amongst those requiring special regional development aid. The Netherlands Government has not included that area amongst those requiring special regional development aid. The Netherlands Government, in its comments submitted to the Commission, itself emphasized that the ""additional premium for major schemes"" was not granted on account of regional considerations.\n\nIn respect of the derogations envisaged in Article 92 (3) (b) of the EEC Treaty, investment of this type is brought about in a general way by normal market forces. Moreover, there is nothing peculiar to the investment in question to qualify it as a project of common European interest or as one designed to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, the promotion of which merits a derogation under Article 92 (3) (b) of the EEC Treaty from the principle of the incompatibility of aids laid down by Article 92 (1).

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas establishments in third countries cannot be authorized to export fresh meat to the Community unless they satisfy the general and special conditions laid down in Directive 72/462/EEC;
Whereas Czechoslovakia has forwarded, in accordance with Article 4 (3) of Directive 72/462/EEC, a list of the establishments authorized to export fresh meat to the Community;

Whereas the case of the other establishments proposed by Czechoslovakia has to be re-examined on the basis of additional information regarding their hygiene standards and their ability to adapt quickly to Community rules;
Whereas, in the meantime and so as to avoid any abrupt interruption of existing trade flows, these establishments may be authorized temporarily to continue their exports of fresh meat to those Member States prepared to accept them;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (1), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromochloromethane.
(2) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.
(3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.
(4) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, as well as Decisions VII/11, XI/15 and XV/5 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of the controlled substance listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical uses of methyl bromide.
(5) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs), all Member States have notified (2) to the United Nations Environment Programme the active ingredients for which chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of CFC-MDIs for placing on the market of the European Community.
(6) Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).
(7) The Commission has published a Notice (3) on the 22 July 2006 to those companies in the Community of 25 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2007 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2007.
(8) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system, it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2007.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee established by Article 18(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000,","{'header': '4.4.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 94/39', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 27 March 2007\non the allocation of quantities of controlled substances allowed for essential uses in the Community in 2007 under Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document number C(2007) 1285)\n(Only the Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, French, German, Italian, Slovenian and Spanish texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/211/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromochloromethane.\n\n((2)) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.\n\n((3)) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.\n\n((4)) Decision XV/8 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, as well as Decisions VII/11, XI/15 and XV/5 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 700/2007
of 11 June 2007
on the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The second subparagraph of Article 2, in conjunction with point (b) of the first subparagraph of that Article, of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1) provides that the Council is to adopt general rules concerning measures to promote better organisation of production, processing and marketing.
(2) The systems of production of bovine animals aged 12 months or less and their characteristics at the time of slaughter often differ from one Member State to another. On the main consumer markets in the Community, meat from these different production systems is generally marketed under one single sales description.
(3) Experience shows that this practice could disturb trade and encourage unfair competition. Consequently, it has a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the internal market.
(4) This practice could also cause confusion for consumers and is likely to mislead them.
(5) To improve the functioning of the internal market, the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less should be organised in such a way as to make it as transparent as possible. This will also enable such production to be better organised. For that purpose, the sales descriptions to be used in each language of the Member States for the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less should be specified. This will also improve information for consumers.
(6) In certain cases, the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less enjoys protection under Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (2). In those cases it is marketed under the protected indication or designation and, as a result, can be precisely identified by operators and consumers. Accordingly, this Regulation should not affect those protected indications and designations.
(7) Various studies have shown that the organoleptic characteristics of meat, such as tenderness, flavour and colour, change with the age of the animals from which it is obtained and the feed used.
(8) According to a public consultation organised by the Commission in 2005, for a majority of consumers the age of the animals and what they have been fed on are important criteria in determining the characteristics of their meat. On the other hand, the weight of the animals on slaughter appears to be less important.
(9) The systems of production and the type of feed used for animals aged 12 months or less are linked to the age at which the animals go to slaughter. It is easier to monitor age on slaughter than the type of feed used. Consequently, the use of different sales descriptions according to the age of the animals should be sufficient to provide the necessary transparency.
(10) According to the same consultation, most consumers consider that animals aged eight months or less belong in a category of their own. That age limit is also used in Article 130 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (3) to determine the eligibility of animals for the slaughter premium. Therefore, that age limit should be used to divide the category of animals aged 12 months or less into two sub-categories.
(11) The consultation also showed that, depending on the Member State, consumer expectations of the same sales description can differ. Therefore, when selecting sales descriptions, it makes sense to take account as far as possible of customs and cultural traditions to help consumers make a choice in line with their expectations.
(12) Provision should also be made for the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less to be identified by a letter representing the category to which they belong.
(13) Operators wishing to supplement the sales descriptions provided for in this Regulation by other voluntary information should be able to do so in accordance with the procedure provided for in Articles 16 or 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products (4).
(14) To ensure correct use of the information on the labelling in accordance with this Regulation, the data enabling the correctness of the information on the labelling to be verified should be recorded at all stages of production and marketing. To this end, it should be possible to apply the recording system referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1825/2000 of 25 August 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the labelling of beef and beef products (5), subject to necessary adaptations.
(15) The Member States should designate the authorities competent to carry out checks relating to the conditions laid down in this Regulation and provision should be made for the Commission to ensure, where necessary by means of on-the-spot checks, that those conditions are met.
(16) For the sake of consistency, provision should be made to ensure that meat imported from third countries meets the requirements of this Regulation. For that purpose, where checks are carried out by an independent third-party body, that body must provide full assurance of expertise, impartiality and objectivity.
(17) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6),","{'header': '22.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 161/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 700/2007\nof 11 June 2007\non the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The second subparagraph of Article 2, in conjunction with point (b) of the first subparagraph of that Article, of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1)provides that the Council is to adopt general rules concerning measures to promote better organisation of production, processing and marketing.\n\n((2)) The systems of production of bovine animals aged 12 months or less and their characteristics at the time of slaughter often differ from one Member State to another.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of 18 December 2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 131 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 establishes registration obligations of Community manufacturers or importers of substances on their own, in preparations or articles, as well as provisions concerning evaluation of substances and the obligations of downstream users. Article 2(7)(a) of that Regulation provides that substances included in Annex IV are exempted from Titles II, V and VI of the same regulation as sufficient information is known about these substances that they are considered to cause minimum risk because of their intrinsic properties. In addition, Article 2(7)(b) of the same Regulation provides that substances covered by Annex V are exempted from the same titles of the Regulation, as registration is deemed inappropriate or unnecessary for these substances and their exemption from these titles does not prejudice the objectives of the Regulation.
(2) Article 138(4) of that Regulation requires the Commission to review Annexes IV and V by 1 June 2008 with a view to proposing amendments, if appropriate.
(3) The review carried out by the Commission pursuant to Article 138(4) has revealed that three substances listed in Annex IV should be removed from that Annex, as insufficient information is known about these substances for them to be considered as causing minimum risk because of their intrinsic properties. This is the case with vitamin A, as that substance may present significant risks of reproductive toxicity. This is also the case with carbon and graphite, in particular due to the fact that the concerned Einecs and/or CAS numbers are used to identify forms of carbon or graphite at the nano-scale, which do not meet the criteria for inclusion in this Annex.
(4) Furthermore, three noble gases (helium, neon and xenon) fulfil the criteria for inclusion into Annex IV and should therefore be moved there from Annex V. Another noble gas, krypton, which meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV, should be added to the Annex for reasons of consistency. Three other substances (fructose, galactose and lactose) should be added because they have been identified as meeting the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV. Limestone should be deleted from Annex IV as it is a mineral and is already exempted in Annex V. Finally, certain existing entries on oils, fats, waxes, fatty acids and their salts should be deleted, as not all of those substances meet the criteria for inclusion in Annex IV and it is more consistent to include them in a generic entry in Annex V, using a formulation to limit the exemption to substances with a lower hazard profile.
(5) The review carried out by the Commission pursuant to Article 138(4) of the Regulation has revealed that certain amendments should also be made to Annex V. Magnesia should be added, as it has been identified as a substance meeting the criteria for inclusion in Annex V. What is more, it is appropriate to add certain types of glass and ceramic frits which do not meet the classification criteria set out in Council Directive 67/548/EEC (2) and which, in addition, do not have dangerous constituents above the relevant concentration limits, unless there is scientific data proving that these constituents are not available. Certain vegetable oils, fats and waxes and animal oils, fats and waxes, as well as glycerol, that are obtained from natural sources, which are not chemically modified and which do not have any hazardous properties beyond flammability and skin or eye irritancy, should be added to Annex V in order to provide a more consistent treatment of comparable substances and to limit the exemption to substances with lower hazard properties. The same applies to certain fatty acids, which are obtained from natural sources and which are not chemically modified and which do not have any hazardous properties beyond flammability and skin or eye irritancy. The addition of oils, fats, waxes and fatty acids in Annex V corresponds to the deletion of certain individual substances of these groups listed in Annex IV.
(6) The amendments provided for in this Regulation, in particular compost and biogas, are without prejudice to Community legislation on waste.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,","{'header': '9.10.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 268/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 987/2008\nof 8 October 2008\namending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards Annexes IV and V\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 establishes registration obligations of Community manufacturers or importers of substances on their own, in preparations or articles, as well as provisions concerning evaluation of substances and the obligations of downstream users.

Having regard to the Council Decision of 29 July 2002 on the signature and provisional application of an Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement,
Having regard to the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, with regard to an extension of the period laid down in Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement, and in particular Article 3 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part (1), entered into force on 1 February 1995.
(2) Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement lays down that during the first five years after entry into force of the Agreement, and by derogation from paragraph 1(3), Romania may exceptionally, as regards steel products, grant public aid for restructuring purposes, provided that: this leads to the viability of the benefiting firms under normal market conditions at the end of the restructuring period, the amount and intensity of such aid are strictly limited to what is absolutely necessary in order to restore such viability and are progressively reduced, and the restructuring programme is linked to a global rationalising and reduction of capacity in Romania.
(3) The initial period of five years expired on 31 December 1997.
(4) Romania requested an extension of the abovementioned period in December 1997.
(5) It seemed appropriate to grant an extension of this period for an additional period of eight years starting on 1 January 1998 or until the date of Romania’s accession to the European Union, whichever comes first.
(6) To this effect, an Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement was signed by the Community and Romania on 23 October 2002 and is provisionally applied from that date.
(7) Under Article 2 of the Additional Protocol, the extension of the abovementioned period is made conditional on the submission by Romania to the Commission of a restructuring programme and business plans that meet the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement and have been assessed and agreed by its National State Aid Authority (the Competition Council).
(8) In December 2004, Romania submitted to the Commission a restructuring programme and business plans for those companies having benefited or benefiting from state support for restructuring.
(9) Under Article 3 of the Additional Protocol, the extension of the abovementioned period is made conditional on a final assessment of the restructuring programme and business plans by the Commission.
(10) The Commission has made a final assessment of the restructuring programme and the business plans submitted by Romania. This assessment indicates that the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plans will allow the companies concerned to reach viability under normal market conditions.

(1) Whereas Title I of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 introduced a sytem of production aid for certain processed products obtained from fruit and vegetables; whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 504/97 of 19 March 1997 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the system of production aid for products processed from fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 702/1999(4), laid down general rules applicable to that system of aid; whereas without prejudice to the other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 504/97 certain specific rules have to be laid down for the characteristics required of dried figs if they are to qualify for production aid;
(2) Whereas the quality of dried figs before and after processing is variable; whereas the minimum price and production aid should be fixed for a specific type of product; whereas Community production is characterised by two types of dried fig, small-fruit and others; whereas the essential characteristic which distinguishes the market price of both types is their size; whereas the minimum price and the aid should therefore be fixed for the most representative size class for each of the two types of dried figs intended for direct consumption, and the price and aid applicable to the other sizes should be derived from these prices and aid rates;
(3) Whereas the aim of minimum quality requirements laid down in Article 4(4)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 is to avoid the production of products for which there is no demand or which would cause distortion of the market; whereas those requirements must be based on traditional, fair manufacturing procedures; whereas, to ensure compliance with these provisions, the minium characteristics required of unprocessed dried figs purchased by processors and dried figs qualifying for aid should be defined;
(4) Whereas, to ensure uniform application, rules should be laid down on carrying out checks on the characteristics of dried figs before and after processing;
(5) Whereas certain requirements of this Regulation call for far-reaching adjustments of the production and processing sector; whereas these requirements must therefore be introduced progressively over the five marketing years following the entry into force of this Regulation;
(6) Whereas this Regulation incorporates the provisions specific to figs in Articles 1 and 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1709/84 of 19 June 1984 on minimum prices payable to producers and amounts of production aid for certain processed fruit and vegetables eligible for production aid(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1591/98(6), updated in line with legal, technical and economic developments; whereas, therefore, Articles 1 and 2 of and Annexes I, II and III to that Regulation should be repealed;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), and in particular Article 18(6) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (2), and in particular Article 22(1) and (6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry and birds, which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.
(3) On 6 August 2004 the Republic of South Africa has confirmed two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in ratite flocks in the Eastern Cape Province.
(4) This detected avian influenza virus strain is of subtype H5N2 and therefore different from the strain currently causing the epidemic in Asia. Current knowledge suggests that the risk for public health in relation to this subtype is inferior to the risk of the strain circulating in Asia, which is an H5N1 virus subtype.
(5) At this moment for poultry and poultry products, the Republic of South Africa is only authorised to export to the Community live ratites and their hatching eggs and fresh meat from ratites and meat products/meat preparations containing ratite meat, as well as birds other than poultry.
(6) However the competent authorities of the Republic of South Africa suspended certification of live ratites and their meat and certain meat products to the EU on 6 August 2004 until the situation becomes clearer.
(7) In view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, imports of live ratites, and hatching eggs of these species and fresh meat of ratites, meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of those species, obtained from birds slaughtered after 16 July 2004, have been suspended from the Republic of South Africa as of 10 August 2004 by Commission Decision 2004/594/EC (3).
(8) In accordance with Commission Decision 2000/666/EC (4) importation of birds other than poultry is authorised from all member countries of the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) subject to animal health guarantees provided by the country of origin, and to strict post-import quarantine measures implemented in the Member States.
(9) However, the importation of birds other than poultry, including pet birds accompanying their owners has also been suspended from the Republic of South Africa by Decision 2004/594/EC as an additional measure in order to exclude any possible risk for disease occurrence in quarantine stations under the authority of the Member States.
(10) Commission Decision 97/222/EC (5), lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products, and establishes treatment regimes in order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products. The treatment that must be applied to the product depends on the health status of the country of origin, in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; in order to avoid an unnecessary burden on trade, imports of ratite meat products originating in the Republic of South Africa treated to a temperature of at least 70 °C throughout the product should continue to be authorised.
(11) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), the importation of non-treated game trophies from birds originating from the Republic of South Africa is currently authorised. In view of the current avian influenza situation these imports should be suspended, thus preventing any risk of disease introduction into the Community.
(12) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of feathers originating from the Republic of South Africa is currently authorised. In view of the current avian influenza situation these imports should be suspended, thus preventing any risk of disease introduction into the Community. However the importation of feathers may be authorised with an accompanying commercial document that states that the feathers have undergone a certain treatment.
(13) Sanitary control measures applicable to raw material for the manufacture of animal feedingstuffs and pharmaceutical or technical products allow the exclusion from the scope of this Decision of channelled imports of such products.
(14) Therefore the protection measures applicable to the whole territory of the Republic of South Africa should be prolonged and Decision 2004/594/EC should be repealed.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health.","{'header': '25.8.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 275/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 24 August 2004\nconcerning protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Republic of South Africa\n(notified under document number C(2004) 3293)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2004/614/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry and birds, which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming.\n\n((2)) There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.\n\n((3)) On 6 August 2004 the Republic of South Africa has confirmed two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in ratite flocks in the Eastern Cape Province.\n\n((4)) This detected avian influenza virus strain is of subtype H5N2 and therefore different from the strain currently causing the epidemic in Asia.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organisation of the market in wine (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2087/97 (4), prohibits the making of wine from grape varieties classed as table grapes from 1 August 1997; whereas the abolition of this possible alternative use for table grapes is causing serious difficulties on the fresh fruit market in some regions of the Community where large quantities of the product were turned into wine and then distilled; whereas these difficulties are likely to result in a marked increase in withdrawals with no possibility of disposal for the producer organisations concerned; whereas it therefore appears justified to implement a transitional measure under the common organisation of the market in fresh products where the abovementioned difficulties arise;
Whereas provision should be made, for a transitional period, for the Member States to be able to distil table grapes withdrawn from the market; whereas such distillation must be carried out by authorised distilleries providing the guarantees required as regards technical equipment and controls; whereas provisions must be adopted for cases where the authorised distilleries are unable to treat the unprocessed grapes;
Whereas measures should be laid down ensuring effective controls to prevent such grapes withdrawn from the market from being used for winemaking or as a fermented product in the wine sector; whereas such measures relate to the requirement to restrict the movement of grapes withdrawn and to the addition on an identifier to the grapes to enable them to be identified and to prevent their use in the wine sector; whereas provision should also be made for the denaturing of the alcohol obtained from distillation of such grapes and to allow disposal of the alcohol only outside the agricultural and spirit drink sectors;
Whereas Member States are required to ensure equal access to all operators concerned by means of appropriate procedures such as invitations to tender or public auctions; whereas they are also required to prevent any distortion of the wine and alcohol market; whereas they must also ensure that checks are made on the method by which the alcohol is obtained;

(3) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted.

These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, prices on the international market. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.

Having regard to Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the committee established by Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2),
Whereas:
(1) Where a national standard transposing a harmonised standard, the reference of which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, covers one or more essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC, the machine built in accordance with this standard is presumed to meet the essential health and safety requirements concerned.
(2) Two petitions have been addressed by the same person to the European Parliament referring to fatal occupational accidents occurred in Germany involving earth-moving machinery, claiming that accidents were related to the insufficient visibility from the driving position. The machinery concerned was designed in accordance with harmonised standard EN 474-1 ‘Earth-moving machinery — Safety — Part 1: General requirements’.
(3) As a consequence, the harmonised standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 ‘Earth-moving machinery — Safety — Part 1: General requirements’, whose reference was first published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 28 November 2013 (3) was examined by the Commission together with the representatives of the committee established by Article 22 of Directive 2006/42/EC. It was concluded that the earth-moving machinery designed and manufactured according to the standard does not allow the driver to have sufficient visibility in order to operate the machinery without a risk for the driver or third persons.
(4) As a result, the Commission concluded that the harmonised standard EN 474-1:2006+A4:2013 fails to meet the essential health and safety requirements provided for in points 1.2.2 Control devices (visibility of danger zones during starting) and 3.2.1.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas by 1 January 1992 all Member States must have discontinued routine vaccination against  foot-and-mouth disease in their territory;
Whereas, however, in view of the high density of susceptible species in some parts of the  Community, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of emergency vaccination in a limited  area, in circumstances where slaughter of the entire herd may not be sufficient to eliminate the  virus;
Whereas Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine should be established, based on stocks  of concentrated inactivated antigen capable of being quickly converted into vaccine for emergency  use;
Whereas the antigen should be stored at four separate locations; whereas facilities for  formulation, bottling and distribution must also be provided;
Whereas the criteria for the supply and storage of antigen and its conversion into vaccine should  be established;
Whereas the national institutes responsible for maintaining the reserve of antigen should cooperate  with the Community Coordinating Institute for foot-and-mouth disease vaccines designated by  Decision 91/665/EEC (3) in order to ensure the potency, safety and stability of the antigen, and  vaccines produced therefrom, and to ensure that the quantity and sub-types kept are appropriate to  the risk, on the basis, in particular, of information supplied by the reference laboratory for the  identification of foot-and-mouth disease virus designated by Decision 89/531/EEC (4);

Ratu Josefa ILOILO\nPresident of the Republic of the Fiji Islands\nSuva\nFiji\nExcellency,\nThe European Union attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EC partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which form the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement, and form the basis of our relations.\nOn 11 December 2006 the Council of the European Union condemned the military takeover in Fiji.\nUnder Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, and considering that the military takeover which took place on 5 December 2006 constituted a violation of the essential elements listed in Article 9 of that Agreement, the EU invited Fiji to consultations in order, as provided for in the Agreement, to thoroughly examine the situation and, where necessary, take steps to remedy it.\nThe formal part of those consultations began in Brussels on 18 April 2007. The Interim Government of Fiji made a presentation based on a submission dated 18 April 2007 on the reasons for the military takeover of 5 December 2006, on developments in the country’s situation since the takeover, and on the Interim Government’s programme for the transitional period.\nThe EU took note of the Interim Government’s submission of 18 April 2007 to the EU.\nFor its part, the EU was pleased that the Interim Government confirmed a number of key commitments regarding human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for democratic principles and the rule of law, as noted below, and proposed positive steps regarding their implementation. Fiji also agreed to close cooperation regarding the monitoring and verification of the commitments.\nMost of the commitments made in the context of the consultations will be implemented over an extended period, and it is consequently necessary to monitor and verify their implementation closely over time. The EU underlines that, following the credible general elections held in Fiji as recently as May 2006 and in the light of the findings and recommendations of the EU Election Monitoring Mission, and notably the final report from the EU Chief Observer, MEP Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the EU is of the view that new and credible elections can be held well within the agreed deadline of 28 February 2009.\nThe EU stresses the importance of early and full compliance with the agreed commitments listed in annex.\nThe EU notes that the Interim Government, in accordance with the agreed commitments, had lifted the Public Emergency Regulations on 31 May 2007 and that it accepted the findings and recommendations of the Pacific Islands Forum independent election experts on 19 June 2007.\nThe EU is concerned about the recent lack of progress by the interim Government on process and the substance of the commitments it has agreed to. The interim Government committed to regular dialogue and to giving full information to the EU on all matters linked to its other commitments. On substance, the EU notes in particular that the interim Government has yet to undertake a tribunal pursuant to Section 138(3) of the constitution due by 15 July 2007 and looks forward to a decision as soon as possible.\nIn the spirit of partnership that underlies the Cotonou Agreement and in the light of the positive outcome of the consultations, the EU expressed its readiness to support implementation of Fiji’s commitments. The EU looks forward to regular dialogue meetings being resumed on a regular basis, in accordance with the commitment made by the Interim Government.\nThe EU has adopted the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the revised Cotonou Agreement and Article 37 of the Development Cooperation Instrument:\n—\nhumanitarian aid as well as direct support to civil society may continue,\n—\ncooperation activities under way and/or in preparation, in particular under the 8th and 9th EDFs may continue,\n—\nthe 9th EDF End-of-term Review may proceed,\n—\ncooperation activities, which would help the return to democracy and improve governance, may be pursued, save under very exceptional circumstances,\n—\nimplementation of the sugar reform accompanying measures for 2006 may proceed. The financing agreement was signed at the technical level by Fiji on 19 June 2007. It is noted that the financing agreement includes a suspension clause,\n—\nthe Interim Government’s acceptance on 19 June 2007 of the report of 7 June 2007 by the Pacific Islands Forum’s independent election experts is in line with Commitment No 1 agreed on 18 April 2007 between the Interim Government and the EU. Consequently, the preparation and eventual signing of the multi-annual indicative programme for sugar reform accompanying measures for 2008-2010 can proceed,\n—\nthe finalisation, signing at the technical level and implementation of the Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for the 10th EDF with an indicative financial envelope, as well as the possible allocation of an incentive tranche of up to 25\xa0% of this sum, will be subject to respect of the commitments made with regard to human rights and the rule of law; notably that the Interim Government upholds the Constitution, that the independence of the judiciary is fully respected and that the Public Emergency Regulations, reintroduced on 6 September 2007, are lifted as soon as possible, that all allegations of human rights infringements are investigated or dealt with in accordance with the various procedures and forums under the laws of the Fiji Islands and that the Interim Government shall use best endeavours to prevent statements by security agencies destined to intimidate,\n—\nthe 2007 sugar allocation will be zero,\n—\nthe 2008 sugar allocation will become available, subject to evidence of credible and timely preparation of elections in accordance with the agreed commitments; notably regarding census, redrafting of boundaries and electoral reform in accordance with the Constitution, that measures will be taken to ensure the functioning of the Elections Office, including the appointment by a Supervisor of Elections by 30 September 2007 in accordance with the Constitution,\n—\nthe 2009 sugar allocation will become available subject to a legitimate government being in place,\n—\nthe 2010 sugar allocation will depend on progress made in implementing the 2009 sugar allocation and the continuation of the democratic process,\n—\nadditional support for the preparation and implementation of key commitments, in particular in support of the preparation and/or holding of elections, could be considered over and above what is described in this letter,\n—\nregional cooperation, and Fiji’s participation in it, is unaffected,\n—\ncooperation with the European Investment Bank and the Centre for the Development of Enterprise may continue subject to the timely fulfilment of commitments made.\nFollow-up of the commitments will be in accordance with the commitments on monitoring in terms of regular dialogue, cooperation with missions and reporting, as referred to in Annex.\nFurthermore, the EU expects Fiji to cooperate fully with the Pacific Islands Forum regarding the implementation of the recommendations by the Eminent Persons’ Group, as endorsed by the Forum Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Vanuatu on 16 March 2007.\nThe European Union will continue to follow the situation in Fiji closely. Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, an enhanced political dialogue will be conducted with Fiji to ensure the respect for human rights, restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law until both parties conclude that the enhanced nature of dialogue has served its purpose.\nIf there is a slowing down, breakdown or reversal in the implementation by the Interim Government of the commitments made, the EU reserves the right to adjust the appropriate measures.\nThe EU stresses that Fiji’s privileges in its cooperation with the EU depend on respect for the essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and for the values referred to in the Development Cooperation Instrument. In order to convince the EU that the interim government is fully prepared to follow-up on the commitments given, it is essential that early and substantial progress is made in the fulfilment of the agreed commitments.\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council'}]}"

","COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/57/EEC of 29 June 1993 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively
THE COUNCIL OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas it appears desirable to update the nomenclature in Annex I to each of Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC to conform with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2587/91 (3);
Whereas it also appears desirable to enlarge the scope of Annex I to Directive 86/362/EEC to include husked rice and semi-milled or wholly milled rice in addition to paddy or rough rice, since a significant proportion of rice is put into circulation as  such;
Whereas, in the light of technical and scientific progress and the requirements of public health and agriculture, it is now desirable to supplement Annex II to Directive 86/363/EEC in respect of the provisions for the establishment of maximum levels for  birds' eggs and egg yolks and to establish levels for the pesticides therein listed; whereas, for clarity, it appears desirable to present a consolidated version of the said Annex;
Whereas it is also desirable, on the same grounds, to amend Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC by adding provisions relating to further pesticide residues for cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin, namely acephate, benomyl, carbendazim,  chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, chlorthalonil, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, glyphosate, imazalil, iprodione, mancozeb, maneb, methamidophos, metiram, permethrin, procymidone, propineb, thiophanate-methyl, vinclozolin, zineb;
Whereas, however, available data are insufficient for certain pesticide-cereal/foodstuffs of animal origin combinations as appropriate; whereas a period of time, not exceeding four years, will be necessary to generate such data; whereas, therefore,  maximum levels should be established on the basis of such data by 1 January 1998 at the latest; whereas failure to provide satisfactory data would normally result in the establishment of levels at the appropriate limit of determination;
Whereas, in order better to estimate dietary intake of pesticide residues, it is prudent to establish simultaneously, where possible, maximum residue levels for individual pesticides in all major components of the diet; whereas these levels represent  the use of minimum quantities of pesticide to achieve adequate control, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable;
Whereas the maximum residue levels established in the current Directive will have to be reviewed in the framework of the re-evaluations of active substances provided for in the work programme established in Article 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC  of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (4),","{'title': 'Council Directive 93/57/EEC of 29 June 1993 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDirective 86/362/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 28 May 1997, the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-rolled, originating in Russia.
(2) The complaint was lodged by the Italian Narrow Cold-Rolled Strips Producers Association (Federacciai), on behalf of Italian producers whose collective output was alleged to represent the quasi-totality of Italian production of cold-rolled narrow strips.
(3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) The Commission, after consultation, accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-rolled, currently classifiable within CN codes 7211 23 99, 7211 29 50, 7211 29 90 and ex 7211 90 90 and originating in Russia.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By letter of 12 September 1997 to the Commission, Federacciai formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-rolled, originating in Russia in view of the current market situation concerning this product.
(7) Interested parties were informed that, under these circumstances, the Commission intends to terminate the proceeding, and were given the opportunity to comment. None of them raised any objection.
(8) The Commission considers therefore that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-rolled, originating in Russia, should be terminated without the imposition of protective measures, and that such a termination would not be against the interest of the Community.","{'title': '98/141/EC: Commission Decision of 12 February 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Italy of certain flat-rolled narrow strips, of iron or non-alloy steel, cold-rolled, originating in Russia'}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 of 29 November 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas (1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 provides that each year from 1 January, an autonomous tariff quota of 775 000 tonnes net weight subject to a zero-duty rate is to be opened for imports of bananas under CN code 0803 00 19 originating in ACP countries.
(2) The tariff quota provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 for 2007 should therefore be opened and the provisions for its administration laid down for the period until 31 December 2007.
(3) As is the case for non preferential imports, a method of administering the tariff quota should be adopted so as to favour international trade and smoother trade flows. The most appropriate method for this purpose would be that using the quota by chronological order of acceptance of the declarations of release for free circulation (the ‘first come, first served’ method). Nevertheless, in order to ensure continuity of trade with ACP countries and, therefore, satisfactory supplies for the Community market while avoiding disturbances in trade flows, Commission Regulation (EC) No 219/2006 (2) reserved, on a transitional basis, part of the tariff quota for operators who supplied the Community with ACP bananas in the framework of the import regime previously in force. Taking into account the transitional nature of that provision, it appears appropriate to progressively eliminate it and hence ensuring for 2007 a substantial increase in the part of the tariff quota managed by the first come, first served method, by increasing the proportion of imports carried out under that system from 60 % to 81 %.
(4) Provision should therefore be made for a total quantity of 146 848 tonnes of the tariff quota to be reserved for the operators who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community during 2006 That proportion of the tariff quota should be administered by means of import licences issued to each operator in proportion to the quantities imported on the basis of licences received by these operators under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.
(5) In view of the quantities available, a ceiling should be set for the licence application which each operator may lodge for the period until 31 December 2007.
(6) Access to the rest of the tariff quota should be open to all operators established in the Community on a ‘first come, first served’ basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3).

The most appropriate method for this purpose would be that using the quota by chronological order of acceptance of the declarations of release for free circulation (the ‘first come, first served’ method). Nevertheless, in order to ensure continuity of trade with ACP countries and, therefore, satisfactory supplies for the Community market while avoiding disturbances in trade flows, Commission Regulation (EC) No 219/2006(2)reserved, on a transitional basis, part of the tariff quota for operators who supplied the Community with ACP bananas in the framework of the import regime previously in force. Taking into account the transitional nature of that provision, it appears appropriate to progressively eliminate it and hence ensuring for 2007 a substantial increase in the part of the tariff quota managed by the first come, first served method, by increasing the proportion of imports carried out under that system from 60\xa0% to 81\xa0%.\n\n((4)) Provision should therefore be made for a total quantity of 146\xa0848 tonnes of the tariff quota to be reserved for the operators who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community during 2006 That proportion of the tariff quota should be administered by means of import licences issued to each operator in proportion to the quantities imported on the basis of licences received by these operators under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.\n\n((5)) In view of the quantities available, a ceiling should be set for the licence application which each operator may lodge for the period until 31 December 2007.\n\n((6)) Access to the rest of the tariff quota should be open to all operators established in the Community on a ‘first come, first served’ basis in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(3).\n\n((7)) This Regulation should enter into force immediately in order to enable licence applications to be lodged in time.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject\nThe zero-duty tariff quota for the import of bananas falling under CN code 0803\xa000\xa019 originating in ACP countries provided for in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 is hereby opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 2007.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Available quantities', 'text': 'Article 2\nAvailable quantities\nThe quantities available under the tariff quota are set at 775\xa0000 tonnes, of which:\n(a)\n146\xa0848 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter II and have the serial number 09.4164.\n(b)\n628\xa0152 tonnes is to be administered in accordance with Chapter III and have the order numbers: 09.1634, 09.1638, 09.1639, 09.1640, 09.1642, 09.1644.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Import licences', 'text': 'Article 3\nImport licences\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0All imports under the quantity fixed in Article 2(a) shall be subject to the lodging of an import licence issued in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000\n(\n4\n)\nshall be applicable, with the exception of Article 8(4) and (5), subject to the provisions of this Regulation.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'subtitle': 'Lodging licence applications', 'text': 'Article 4\nLodging licence applications\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Economic operators established in the Community who actually imported bananas originating in ACP countries into the Community in 2006, on the basis of licences issued under Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006, shall be entitled to lodge import licence applications.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The quantities applied for by each operator may not exceed 110\xa0% of the quantity imported on the basis of licences allocated to him under chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Import licence applications must be lodged by each operator on 8 and 9 January 2007 with the competent authorities of the Member State which issued him in 2006 with the import licences for the quantities referred to in paragraph 2.\nThe competent authorities in each Member State shall be as listed in the Annex.

Whereas, on 20 February 1986, Touring applied to the Minister for Urban Development, Housing and Transport of North Rhine-Westphalia for the authorization which expired on 8 June 1986 to be renewed; whereas Touring received a provisional authorization until 7 September 1986 pursuant to Article 16a of the Regulation; whereas, however, on 14 August 1986, the local authorizing authority in Duesseldorf, in the person of the Regierungspraesident, rejected the application for a renewal of the authorization;
Whereas, on 1 December 1986, the Federal Minister of Transport asked the Luxembourg Minister of Transport to accept this decision by the German authorizing authority; whereas, on 21 January 1987, the Luxembourg Minister of Transport rejected this request in a letter to the relevant Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and asked for the decision by the authorizing authority in Duesseldorf to be reconsidered; whereas, in a letter of 9 March 1987 to the Federal Minister of Transport, the Luxembourg Minister of Transport confirmed its position stressing that it placed great importance on the continuation of this service;
Whereas, on 11 March 1987, Emile Weber S.a.r.l. itself applied to the Luxembourg Minister of Transport for an authorization for this service; whereas it received a provisional three-month authorization in March 1987; whereas this was extended before its expiry until 9 September 1987;
Whereas the relevant Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia informed the Luxembourg Minister of Transport of its refusal to renew the authorization by letter of 22 May 1987;
Whereas, in view of the fact that the two governments were unable to reach agreement on a new authorization for the service, the Luxembourg Government referred the dispute to the Commission on 1 June 1987 pursuant to Article 14 of the Regulation requesting that the application made by Emile Weber S.a.r.l. be approved;
Whereas the German Government made a similar application to the Commission on 1 July 1987 requesting the Commission to settle the dispute and, if it gave a positive ruling, to grant the authorization to Touring; whereas Touring is willing to continue to contract the service out to Emile Weber S.a.r.l. as it has done in the past;
Whereas Touring confirmed its willingness to do so in a letter of 7 July 1987 to the Federal Minister of Transport;
Whereas the Member States concerned attended a meeting at the Commission in Brussels on 3 July 1987 to discuss these two applications;
II
Whereas the German authorizing authority put forward the following arguments:
The authorization would be incompatible with the interests of public transport. Article 8 of the Regulation should be interpreted as a provision favouring the railways which form the backbone of passenger transport in all European countries. The railways needed therefore to be protected against competition from private regular services. The economic interests of such firms in the establishment of further passenger services would have to be subordinated to this need. In this particular case, the State also had to act in the interests of the Community as a whole and the overriding public concern to maintain an efficient transport system.
The regular road service for which authorization is requested is, in this case, only a seemingly better service, the cost being included in the price of the air fare. The time required for the rail journey is not excessive for passengers compared with their overall travelling time. Rail transport also guarantees connections even if flights are not on time.
The rail connection between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg (10 trains a day in each direction and a journey of three and a half to four hours) can generally be said to provide a quantitatively and qualitatively satisfactory solution to the transport needs in question;
Whereas the Luxembourg Government put forward the following arguments:
The regular service in question has existed for over 20 years and has given no reason for complaint during that time.
The persons using this service are solely Luxavia passengers who have paid for the cost of the connecting journey in the price of their air ticket. The transfer of this service to the railways is unacceptable to passengers:
- owing to the problems involved in changing means of transport/vehicle several times with cumbersome luggage,
- owing to the fact that the journey takes longer by rail than by road,
- because there are no immediate connections if flights arrive late,
- because of the need to pick passengers up at Brussels or take passengers to Brussels since flights are often diverted there;
III
Whereas the applications made by the two Governments are admissible under Article 14, and in accordance with Article 13 of the Regulation; whereas they should be examined in the light of Article 8 (1) and (2), subparagraph (a) thereof;
Whereas the aim of these provisions is, as defined in the recitals to the Regulation, to ensure the proper functioning of services at minimum cost to the community in general, and it is necessary to adapt the supply of transport to demand on the routes to be served and to coordinate passenger transport services in the areas concerned in an effective manner;
Whereas the principle of coordinating transport services to satisfy specific transport needs effectively and at minimum cost must, however, be applied in specific cases in the light of the Community's transport policy and the structure of its transport markets; whereas Article 8 of the Regulation cannot hence be interpreted as a provision which provides absolute protection to the railways or which gives unconditional priority to them; whereas, although the railways are an essential means of transport for passengers in the Community economy, they cannot have a monopoly in these markets;
Whereas, at this level of generality, the principal reasons given by the authorizing authority in Duesseldorf for its decision cannot therefore be accepted;
Whereas decisions in individual cases can, on the contrary, only be made in the light of the particular conditions applying; whereas, although this does not mean that the public transport interests do not have to be taken into account, they do have to be weighed against the specific interests of the transport users concerned and of other transport enterprises;
Whereas, after examining the present and foreseeable transport needs which have to be satisfied by the transport service in question, it has been concluded that a direct coach service between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg through the Eifel offers transport users appreciable advantages over a rail service via Trier and Koblenz. Whereas the coach service has in this particular case the qualitative advantages of:
- a direct connection between Luxembourg airport and Duesseldorf main station without the need to change or transfer luggage, which would be the case by rail,
- a shorter journey.
Whereas this cannot be outweighed by the somewhat greater comfort (more space, refreshments) of rail transport;
Whereas the coach service also has one great quantitative advantage, namely that it provides a guaranteed and straightforward connection with the flight, even if aeroplanes are diverted to Brussels;
Whereas, when all the relevant factors are taken into account in this comparison, it must be concluded that road transport offers a better overall service; whereas this is of particular relevance in this specific case as it involves a special regular service with a limited number of customers and special needs; Whereas, furthermore, this service has operated for over 20 years without any problems; whereas it is hard to see how the market situation and effect on the transport industries can have changed so much that the authorization must now be refused on the basis of new factors or events; whereas a major factor militating in favour of the renewal of the authorization is the interest of both companies in continuing a service they have offered, without objections being made and in accordance with the authorization, over a long period, with all the investment which is tied up in it; whereas, the operators' interest generally corresponds to the still existing and undisputed demand on the side of the transport users;
Whereas, in the light of all these factors, it is concluded that the coach service for which authorization is applied offers a better service than the competing rail services which do not satisfy the specific needs of this particular transport market in the same way,","{'title': '88/40/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 November 1987 settling a dispute between the Federal Republic of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg about the authorization of a regular coach service (Only the German and French texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe competent authority of the Federal Republic of Germany shall authorize Deutsche Touring GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, to have a special regular service by coach between Duesseldorf and Luxembourg set up and operated by Voyages Emile Weber S.a.r.l., Canach, Luxembourg, as requested by those undertakings.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\n\nThis Decision shall take effect 30 days after its notification to the Member States concerned unless one of those Member States refers the matter to the Council before expiry of that time limit.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 November 1987.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nStanley CLINTON DAVIS\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 67, 20. 3. 1972, p. 19.\n\n(2) OJ No L 158, 16. 6. 1978, p. 1.'}]}"

To facilitate the transition to the new arrangements, the final date for payment for the 1999/2000 wine year should be 31 August 2000.
(3) Under Article 1(4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2641/88 of 25 August 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the aid scheme for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must to produce grape juice(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 583/98(7), processing operations must be carried out between 1 September and 31 August of the wine year concerned. To facilitate the transition to the new arrangements, the final processing date should be confirmed as 31 August 2000 for the 1999/2000 wine year. In addition, Article 8(2) of that Regulation provides that in order to qualify for the aid, processors as referred to in Article 2(2) must submit one or more aid applications to the competent authority or department authorised for the purpose, not later than six months after the end of the wine year. To facilitate transition to the new arrangements, 28 February 2001 should be laid down as the date for submission of aid applications for the 1999/2000 wine year.
(4) Under Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2721/88 of 31 August 1988 laying down detailed rules for voluntary distillation as provided for in Articles 38, 41 and 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87(8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 26/92(9), distillation may not be carried out after the end of the wine year concerned. To facilitate the transition to the new arrangements, the final date for distillation should be 31 August 2000 for the 1999/2000 wine year. Under the third subparagraph of Article 11(5) of that Regulation, in order to receive aid, fortifiers must submit an application to the competent intervention agency not later than 31 August of the wine year concerned. To facilitate transition to the new arrangements, 31 August 2000 should be laid down as the final date for the submission of aid applications for the 1999/2000 wine year.
(5) Under the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88 of 7 October 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of compulsory distillation as provided for in Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 194/98(11), distillers must make the 80 % payment on account to the producer following delivery of the products and not later than one month after presentation of the invoice to be drawn up for the products concerned before the end of the wine year. To facilitate transition to the new arrangements, it should be specified that the date by which invoices are to be drawn up for the 1999/2000 wine year is 31 August 2000. In addition, under Article 12(1) of that Regulation, subject to Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2179/83(12), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2505/88(13), distillation may not be carried out after 31 August of the wine year concerned. To facilitate the transition to the new arrangements, it should be specified that the final date for distillation for the 1999/2000 wine year is 31 August 2000.
(6) Under Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1294/96 of 4 July 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 as regards harvest, production and stock declarations relating to wine-sector products(14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 225/97(15), natural or legal persons or groups of such persons, other than private consumers and retailers, must declare each year to the competent authorities designated by the Member States the stocks of concentrated grape must, rectified concentrated grape must and wine held by them on 31 August. To facilitate the transition to the new arrangements, that date should be confirmed as 31 August 2000 for the 1999/2000 wine year.
(7) As a transitional measure, because of the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, 31 August 2000 should be laid down as the final date for the withdrawal of by-products of wine-making, as referred to in Article 14(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89(16), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2468/96(17), for the 1999/2000 wine year.

(1) Whereas following information on contamination on poultry products with dioxin the Commission adopted Decision 1999/363/EC(4); whereas this Decision establishes, in particular, that the Belgian authorities shall investigate of possible distribution of contaminated feedingstuffs with dioxins to other farm animals and inform without delay the Commission and other Member States and concerned Third Countries of the results of such investigation;
(2) Whereas, on 2 June 1999, the Belgian authorities have informed the Commission that they have placed under restriction approximately 500 pig holdings which may have received contaminated feedingstuff; whereas, on 3 June 1999, they have also informed the Commission that contaminated feedingstuffs have been distributed to a number of bovine holdings as well;
(3) Whereas the body of toxicological and epidemiological evidence today have led the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to consider TCDD a class 1 carcinogen (highest class in IARC ranking);
(4) Whereas, in the light of the above, it is necessary to take similar measures to those laid down by Decision 1999/363/EC to protect consumers from risks associated to products derived from pigs and bovine animals; whereas, however, the Belgian authorities have not yet taken actions on pigs and bovine animals and derived products similar to those applied in the case of poultry; whereas it is therefore not appropriate to set an end-date for the application of measures in respect of pigs and bovine animals and products derived therefrom; whereas, consequently, these measures should apply to pigs and bovine animals reared in Belgium starting from 15 January 1999, and products derived therefrom; whereas these measures should not apply to products derived from animals which have not been reared in holdings placed under restrictions by the Belgian authorities or which are not contaminated by dioxins following the results of analyses;

fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.
(5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.
(7) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n\n((4)) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.\n\n((5)) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n\n((6)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n\n((7)) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products appearing in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 shall, in respect of the products listed in the Annex to this Regulation, be fixed in accordance with that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 27 August 2004.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 27 August 2004 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\nex\xa00402\xa010\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\xa0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a)\non exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n—\n—\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n20,30\n29,00\nex\xa00402\xa021\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\xa0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a)\nwhere goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 are exported\n25,23\n36,05\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n49,00\n70,00\nex\xa00405\xa010\nButter, with a fat content by weight of 82\xa0% (PG 6):\n(a)\nwhere goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 are exported\n32,20\n46,00\n(b)\non exportation of goods of CN code 2106\xa090\xa098  containing 40\xa0% or more by weight of milk fat\n96,78\n138,25\n(c)\non exportation of other goods\n91,70\n131,00'}]}"

(2) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 900/2007 of 27 July 2007 on a standing invitation to tender to determine refunds on exports of white sugar until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year (2) provides for such differentiation by excluding certain destinations.
(3) Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3) provides that where the rate of refund varies according to destination, refunds are to be paid subject to the additional conditions laid down under Articles 15 and 16 of that Regulation.
(4) Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that the products must have been imported in their unaltered state into the third country or one of the third countries for which the refund applies.
(5) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 lists the various documents that may constitute proof of the completion of customs formalities in a third country where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under paragraph 4 of that Article the Commission may decide, in certain specific cases to be determined, that the proof referred to in that Article may be deemed to be furnished by a specific document or in any other way.
(6) In the sugar sector export operations are normally governed by contracts defined as fob on the London futures market. As a result, purchasers accept at that fob stage all the contractual obligations, including proof of completion of customs formalities, without being the direct beneficiaries of the refund to which that proof confers the right. Obtaining that proof for all quantities exported may entail considerable administrative difficulties in certain countries, which may substantially delay or prevent payment of the refund for all the quantities actually exported.
(7) In order to limit the impact on the equilibrium of the sugar market, Commission Regulation (EC) No 436/2007 of 20 April 2007 on proof of completion of customs formalities for the import of sugar into third countries as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (4) provides for relaxation of the rules on proof of completion of customs formalities until 31 December 2007.

of 18 May 2004
accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation and Ukraine and making imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation or Ukraine subject to registration
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 (2) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8, 11(3), 21 and 22(c) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Measures in force
(1) Following an expiry and an interim review, by Regulation (EC) No 658/2002 (3), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ammonium nitrate (the ‘product concerned’) originating in the Russian Federation (‘Russia’). By Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 (4), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ammonium nitrate originating in Ukraine. By Regulation (EC) No 993/2004 (5) the Council amended Regulations (EC) No 658/2002 and (EC) No 132/2001.
(2) The measures are specific duty of 47,07 EUR/tonne in the case of Russia and 33,25 EUR/tonne in the case of Ukraine.
2.   Investigation
(3) On 20 March 2004 the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (6) the initiation of a partial interim review of the measures in force (‘the measures’) pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 22(c) of the basic Regulation.
(4) The review was launched at the initiative of the Commission in order to examine whether, as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘Enlargement’) and, bearing in mind the aspect of Community interest, there is a need to adapt the measures in order to avoid a sudden and excessively negative effect on all interested parties including users, distributors and consumers.
(5) All interested parties, including the Community industry, associations of producers or users in the Community, exporters/producers in the countries concerned, importers and their associations and the relevant authorities of the countries concerned as well as interested parties in the 10 new Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 (the ‘EU10’) were advised of the initiation of the investigation and were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing, to submit information and to provide supporting evidence within the time-limit set out in the notice of initiation. All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.
3.   Result of the investigation
(6) As set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, the investigation concluded that it is in the Community interest to adapt the existing measures, provided that such adaptation does not significantly undermine the desired level of trade defence.
4.   Undertakings
(7) In accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, the Commission, in conformity with Article 8 (2) of the basic Regulation, suggested undertakings to the companies concerned. As a result, undertakings were subsequently proposed by, (i) one exporting producer of the product concerned in Ukraine (OJSC ‘Azot’), (ii) an exporting producer in Russia (CJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot, Russia) jointly with its related company (Cumberland Sound Ltd, British Virgin Islands), (iii) two related exporting producers in Russia (OAO Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat and JSC ‘Azot’), separately and (iv) two related exporting producers jointly (Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’, Russia and Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’, Russia).
(8) From the submissions of OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ and publicly available information on the Internet, it is known to the Commission that JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ are linked via Agrochemical Corporation ‘Azot’, which owns considerably more than 5 % of the capital of each of the companies. Therefore, in accordance with an Article 2 of the basic Regulation and the definition of related parties set out in the Article 143 of Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2286/2003 (8), the Commission considers JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’ as related parties. It should be noted that the abnormal increases of the export volumes of one of these two exporting producers, OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’, to the EU10 observed during the first months of 2004 were higher than the combined traditional export volumes to the EU10 of both JSC ‘Azot’ and OAO ‘Kirovo — Chepetsky Chimkombinat’. Accordingly, the undertaking offers submitted by these two exporting producers are rejected because the undertaking ceiling for the two exporting producers taken together, calculated as traditional export volumes to the EU10 in 2001 and 2002 minus the abnormal increases in export volumes to the EU10 observed in the first months of 2004, is negative.
(9) It should be noted that, in application of Article 22(c) of the basic Regulation, any undertakings accepted by this Regulation are considered as special measures since, in accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, they are not directly equivalent to an anti-dumping duty.
(10) Nevertheless, in conformity with Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect minimum import prices within the framework of import ceilings and, in order that the undertakings can be monitored, the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly, or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor, the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place, or it may adjust the level of the ceiling, or it may take other remedial action.
(11) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way, the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place.
(12) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community, meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission.
(13) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
(14) In view of all the above, the offers of undertakings submitted by OJSC ‘Azot’, CJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot, Russia, and Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’ together with Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’ are considered acceptable.
(15) The acceptance of the undertakings is limited to an initial period of six months without prejudice to the normal duration of the measures. However, six months after acceptance of the undertakings, their continued acceptance will be subject to an appraisal by the Commission to verify whether the exceptional and negative conditions for end users in the EU10 which led to the acceptance of the undertakings still exist. In view of the short term character of the undertakings and the exceptional circumstances under which they are accepted the Commission services may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, adapt some of the terms of the undertakings, if after a reasonable period of time it is established that the undertakings are not achieving their intended results in terms of allowing traditional export flows to the EU10 to continue. However, the adapted terms of the undertakings must continue to ensure a significant contribution to the removal of injury.
B.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(16) In view of the unusual circumstances of this case and the inherent risk of breaches of undertakings caused by the price differences between the EU10 and the EU15 and their short term character, it is considered that sufficient grounds exist to make certain imports of the product concerned subject to registration for a maximum period of nine months in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(17) Customs authorities are therefore directed to take the appropriate steps to register imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Ukraine and Russia exported by the companies which have offered acceptable undertakings and for which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought.
(18) In the event of a finding of a breach of the undertakings, duties may be levied retroactively on goods entered into free circulation in the Community from the date of the breach of the undertaking,","{'header': '20.5.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 183/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1001/2004\nof 18 May 2004\naccepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation and Ukraine and making imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation or Ukraine subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertakings offered by the exporting producers mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Ukraine and the Russian Federation are hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTaric Additional Code\nUkraine\nProduced and exported by OJSC ‘Azot’, Cherkassy, Ukraine to its first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA521\nRussian Federation\nProduced by OJSC MCC Eurochem, Moscow, Russia at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot, Novomoskovsk, Russia and sold by Cumberland Sound Ltd, Tortola, British Virgin Islands to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA522\nRussian Federation\nProduced and exported by Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’, Veliky Novgorod, Russia or Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’ Verkhnedneprovsky, Smolensk Region, Russia to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA532'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community of ammonium nitrate originating in the Ukraine and the Russian Federation falling within CN codes 3102\xa030\xa090 and 3102\xa040\xa090 produced and sold or produced and exported by the companies listed in Article 1 for which an exemption to the anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004 is sought.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day after its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nand shall remain in force for a period of six months.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides that each Member State is to establish a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation.
(2) That system comprises four elements, namely: means of identification to identify each animal; up-to-date registers kept on each holding; movement documents; and a central register or a computer database. The Annex to that Regulation sets out the requirements for those elements.
(3) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 currently provides that animals intended for slaughter before the age of 12 months and not intended for intra-Community trade or export to third countries may be identified with a method complying with the conditions set out in Section A.7 of the Annex to that Regulation. However, in some cases animals which were originally intended for slaughter are nevertheless used for breeding later in holdings other than that of birth. It should therefore be permitted to allow such animals to be individually identified after they have left their holding of birth provided that the individual animal can be traced back to its holding of birth.
(4) Section C of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 sets out the information which should be contained in the movement document. In order to record the individual identification code of each animal on the movement document, animals are to be individually read at departure. Animals are read again in the holding of destination. In order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be permitted to allow the identification codes of animals to be recorded at the holding of destination, instead of at the holding of departure subject to certain conditions.
(5) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 provides for certain keepers to keep an inventory of animals at least annually. Part D of the Annex to that Regulation provides for certain information to be contained in the computer database. The results of the inventory are part of that information. In order to reduce the administrative burden, it should be permissible not to record such results in those Member States where the computer database contains, in addition to the information required pursuant to Part D of that Annex, the individual identification codes of each animal on holdings.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organization of the market in bananas (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Articles 2 to 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 (3) lays down quality standards for bananas to be delivered fresh to the consumer; whereas those quality standards apply to bananas imported from third countries at the stage of release for free circulation, to bananas originating in the Community at the stage of first landing at a Community port and to bananas delivered fresh to the consumer in the producing region at the stage of leaving the packing shed;
Whereas measures should be adopted to ensure uniform application of the rules, in particular as regards conformity checks;
Whereas, while taking due account of the nature of a highly perishable product and of the marketing practices and inspection procedures used in the trade, it should be laid down that checks on conformity are to be carried out in principle at the stage to which the standards apply as laid down in the second paragraph of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2257/94;
Whereas a product which has satisfied checks at that stage is deemed to comply with the standards; whereas that assessment should be without prejudice to any unannounced checks carried out subsequently up to the ripening depot stage;
Whereas the check on conformity must not be systematic but random, by assessment of an overall sample taken at random from the lot selected for checking by the competent body and assumed to be representative of that lot; whereas, for that purpose, the appropriate provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2251/92 of 29 July 1992 on quality inspection of fresh fruit and vegetables (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3148/94 (5), should be made applicable, in the light of the practice and experience acquired in this sector;
Whereas the banana trade is subject to strong competition; whereas the traders concerned have themselves introduced strict checks; whereas checks should not, therefore, be carried out at the stage laid down on traders who offer suitable guarantees as regards staff and handling facilities and who can guarantee that the bananas they market in the Community conform with Community standards; whereas such exemptions must be granted by the Member State on the territory of which the check must in principle be carried out; whereas such exemptions must be withdrawn where the standards and conditions relating thereto are not met;
Whereas, in order for checks to be carried out, information must be supplied to the competent agencies by the traders concerned;
Whereas the certificate of conformity issued upon completion of the checks should not constitute an accompanying document for the bananas up to the final stage of marketing, but a document of proof of the conformity of the bananas with Community standards up to the ripening depot stage, in accordance with the scope of the standard, to be presented at the request of the competent authorities; whereas it should be stressed that bananas not conforming with the standards laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 may not be marketed for fresh consumption in the Community;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2008/599/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 28 August 2007 an application from Sourcon-Padena GmbH & Co. KG for the inclusion of the active substance Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2008/599/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 3 November 2009.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion (4) on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 on 12 November 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 16 July 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134 may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing Pseudomonas sp. strain DSMZ 13134. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

In an EU Presidency statement on 31 December 2008, it roundly condemned the coup as being in contradiction with the very principles of democracy, but stated its readiness to support the ongoing transition in Guinea and a return to constitutional rule. In application of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, the European Union has therefore engaged in a political dialogue with the ruling regime in order to study the situation and possible solutions. The consultations opened in Brussels on 29 April 2009.\nDuring the opening meeting, the participants discussed how to organise a return to constitutional rule and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and transparent elections. Guinea also presented a memorandum on the stages and issues at stake in the transition. The European Union has noted the following proposals put forward by Guinea during the discussions, in particular:\nTransition roadmap\nGuinea has confirmed its commitment to the roadmap proposed by the Coalition des Forces vives on 17 March 2009 and adopted by communiqué No 50 of the President of the CNDD on 28 March 2009. The stages of the roadmap will follow the timetable below:\n—\nthe continuation of voter registration in accordance with the electoral code,\n—\nthe establishment of a National Council for Transition (NCT),\n—\nthe start of work on revising the Fundamental Law,\n—\nthe manufacture and distribution of poll cards,\n—\nthe adoption of amendments to the Fundamental Law,\n—\nparliamentary elections,\n—\npresidential elections,\n—\nresumption of the work of the Commission of Inquiry into the tragic events of June 2006 and January and February 2007.\nNational Council for Transition\n—\nGuinea confirmed that the NCT provided for in the roadmap and adopted by CNDD Presidential Decree No 50 will be established in May 2009.\n—\nThe European Union will make sure that the NCT is established as soon as possible and that the rules relating to its composition, mandate and powers reflect an inclusive and consensual approach.\n—\nGuinea confirmed that the National Forum, provided for in the memorandum, is a distinct exercise from the establishment of the NCT and will have no bearing on its actual implementation.\nRevision of the Fundamental Law\n—\nThe European Union has noted Guinea’s intention to ask the NCT to revise the Fundamental Law and certain organic laws, including the electoral code, before the elections.\n—\nThe European Union will monitor that this work is confined to essential aspects of the transition and the holding of elections and that it has no adverse impact on the roadmap timetable.\nElections\n—\nGuinea has pledged to comply with the election schedule laid down in the roadmap, i.e. parliamentary elections on 11 October 2009 and two rounds of presidential elections on 13 and 27 December 2009. The European Union will monitor compliance with this schedule.\n—\nGuinea has confirmed the undertaking by the President of the CNDD that he, the members of the CNDD and the Prime Minister of the transitional government will not stand in the elections. The European Union considers this to be a crucial undertaking that must be embodied in a formal decision.\n—\nRegarding the preparation and organisation of the elections, Guinea has specified the following measures to ensure that the elections are free and transparent:\n—\nthe National Independent Election Commission has been made wholly responsible for the organisation and management of the elections by CNDD Presidential decree No 015 of 4 January 2009,\n—\nGuinea intends to request an international election observation mission and also undertakes to invite representatives of Guinean civil society to assist in the election observation,\n—\nsteps have been taken to give election candidates fair access to the media,\n—\nthe Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court will be restored to settle electoral disputes and publish the results of the elections.\n—\nAs regards the financing of elections, a detailed budget for each activity will be submitted to the International Contact Group on Guinea for review.\nHuman rights, rule of law and governance\nThe European Union has noted the ongoing efforts of the Guinean transitional government to tackle drug-trafficking, impunity and corruption, and its commitment to carry out audits in order to reform public finances. The European Union attaches particular importance in this respect to the Guinean Government’s commitment to respect the principles of the rule of law, human rights and good governance, in particular:\n—\nconfirmation that no political prisoners are being held,\n—\nthe restoration of the Supreme Court’s judicial chamber as the higher judicial body of the country,\n—\nrespect for the rights of those detained for common law offences, in particular their right to legal representation on being arrested and to a fair trial by the competent legal body,\n—\nrespect for the principle of equality before the law,\n—\nrepayment to the Treasury of funds recovered through audits so that they can be entered in the national budget accounts,\n—\nresumption of the work of the Commission of Inquiry into the tragic events of June 2006 and January and February 2007 once the newly elected government is in place.\nThe European Union found the undertakings made by Guinea broadly encouraging but is concerned about the lack of progress in implementing the roadmap. It has therefore decided to adopt the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the Cotonou Agreement with a view to the gradual resumption of cooperation in order to assist in the transition:\n1.\nThe European Union will continue to finance humanitarian and emergency operations and measures in direct support of the people of Guinea, to assist in the political transition or aimed at ending the crisis. Note that further support for the preparation of the parliamentary and presidential elections could be provided, in particular through mobilisation of the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) B envelope and, if an invitation is received in due course from the Guinean authorities, through the sending of an election observation mission. The European Commission will also continue to finance ongoing contracts for operations other than the above.\n2.\nThe precautionary measures adopted for ongoing projects and programmes under the Ninth and earlier EDFs, excluding projects for the rehabilitation of public buildings and to support decentralisation, will be lifted as soon as an NCT is actually in place, with its mandate, powers and composition agreed by the stakeholders of the transition in Guinea.\n3.\nThe precautionary measures adopted for ongoing projects and programmes under the Ninth and earlier EDFs will be completely lifted on publication of the electoral roll and the decree setting the dates for the election and for the official opening of the election campaign and arrangements for guaranteeing freedom of public assembly and to campaign for political parties.\n4.\nThe continuation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and the resumption of the debt relief process under the HIPC (heavily indebted poor countries) initiative could be supported by a contribution of around EUR 8 million from the European Union to clear arrears owed to the European Investment Bank (EIB) on loans from the EDF by mobilising the 10th EDF B envelope. This support can be mobilised as soon as the filing of nominations for the presidential election is officially closed and it is confirmed that the President and members of the CNDD and the Prime Minister of the transitional government are not standing.\n5.\nThe Country Strategy Paper and National Indicative Programme for Guinea, for an indicative total of EUR 237 million, will be updated, renegotiated and signed as soon as the parliamentary and presidential elections have been held and the members of the National Assembly appointed. A mid-term review of the 10th EDF, the conclusions of which are scheduled for 2010, will analyse the implementation performance and might agree to a reassessment of Guinea’s allocation.\nIn order to ensure the smooth continuation of cooperation measures, the European Commission reserves the right, if necessary, to take over the duties of the EDF National Authorising Officer, in full or in part, on its own account.\nAs part of the procedure under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, the European Union will continue to monitor the situation in Guinea closely over a period of 24 months. During this period, an enhanced dialogue will be pursued with the Guinean Government pursuant to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement in order to support the process of transition and regular reviews will be conducted involving the Presidency of the European Union and the European Commission. The first monitoring mission will take place within no more than six months.\nThe European Union reserves the right to amend the ‘appropriate measures’ described above in the light of progress in the implementation of commitments, particularly those relating to the section on ‘Human rights, rule of law and governance’.\nThe two parties undertake to hold a regular political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement with the newly elected government on reforms in the area of political, judicial and economic governance and in the security sector.\nWe have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\n…\nFor the Council\n…'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 493/2002(2), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
