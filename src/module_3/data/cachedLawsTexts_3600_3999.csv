Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(1), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 11.1 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in Papua New Guinea to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The requirements in the legislation of Papua New Guinea on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular, the ""National Fisheries Authority (NFA)"" is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from Papua New Guinea. In particular those rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with article 3(1) (a) (I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3). These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the NFA to the Commission. It is therefore the responsibility of the NFA to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of Directive 91/493/EEC.
(7) The NFA has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC with regard to the control of fishery products, and regarding the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive.

Whereas:
(1) Under Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards the support schemes for farmers provided for in Titles IV and V thereof (2), the transitional fruit and vegetable payments referred to in Article 1(1)(g) of that Regulation may be granted only for the areas which have been the subject of an aid application in respect of at least 0,3 hectares. By letters of 18 February 2010 and 1 March 2010, Cyprus has informed the Commission about specific size of agricultural holdings and the structure of aid applications in respect of transitional fruit and vegetable payments granted for citrus fruits. As a result, the minimum area for which this payment shall be granted needs to be decreased to 0,1 hectares.
(2) Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 lays down the rules fixing the agricultural area of the new Member States under the single area payment scheme provided for in Article 122 of that Regulation.
(3) In accordance with Article 89 of Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009, the agricultural areas for Poland and Slovakia are set out in Annex VIII to that Regulation.
(4) By letter of 1 December 2009, Poland has informed the Commission that it had reviewed its utilised agricultural area eligible for the single area payment scheme, as referred to in Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. The revision follows the updating of the identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, which has shown that the part of the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 was less than previously estimated.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (1), and in particular Article 23(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Council adopted regulations fixing for 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (2).
(2) Following national investigations carried out in 2005 and 2006 by the United Kingdom the Commission has been notified by the United Kingdom and Ireland that they exceeded the fishing opportunities allocated to them in terms of catches of mackerel (United Kingdom and Ireland) and herring (United Kingdom) in certain zones in the years from 2001 to 2004.
(3) In 2006, following the publication of the regulation (3) adapting certain fish quotas for 2006 pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (4), the United Kingdom also notified the Commission of an additional quantity of mackerel fished in excess in 2005.
(4) Article 23(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 states that the Commission shall operate deductions from future fishing opportunities of the Member States when it has established that they have exceeded the fishing opportunities which were allocated to them.
(5) According to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the Common Fisheries Policy shall ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions.
(6) Given the fact that the overfishing has occurred during the course of several years and considering the need to take account of the economic and social situation of the respective fishing sectors of the concerned Member States and to limit as much as possible the negative impact on those sectors, it is appropriate to deduct the quantities fished in excess over a period longer than one year.
(7) The trend in mackerel quotas from 2001 to 2004 has been downwards. In order to avoid a disproportionate impact of deductions it is necessary to apply a correction factor to the quantities to be deducted from mackerel quotas in respect of amounts overfished from 2001 to 2004.
(8) The additional quantity of mackerel fished in excess by the UK in 2005 should be deducted from the UK's 2007 quota.
(9) The deduction scheme will be compatible with scientific advice since the total allowable catches for mackerel and herring in coming years will be based on scientific advice which will take into account the adjusted catches resulting from reduced quotas.
(10) The correction factor should equate to the 2006 total allowable catch for mackerel expressed as a percentage of the average total allowable catch for the years 2001 to 2004.
(11) Additionally, in order to avoid adverse social and economic consequences, the quantities deducted in any one year should not exceed a percentage of the annual quota. It is appropriate to fix this percentage at 15 %.
(12) In a case where the quantity to be deducted in any one year exceeds 15 % of the annual quota, the deduction period will be extended to reduce the quantity equal to or below 15 %.

In order to avoid a disproportionate impact of deductions it is necessary to apply a correction factor to the quantities to be deducted from mackerel quotas in respect of amounts overfished from 2001 to 2004.\n\n((8)) The additional quantity of mackerel fished in excess by the UK in 2005 should be deducted from the UK's 2007 quota.\n\n((9)) The deduction scheme will be compatible with scientific advice since the total allowable catches for mackerel and herring in coming years will be based on scientific advice which will take into account the adjusted catches resulting from reduced quotas.\n\n((10)) The correction factor should equate to the 2006 total allowable catch for mackerel expressed as a percentage of the average total allowable catch for the years 2001 to 2004.\n\n((11)) Additionally, in order to avoid adverse social and economic consequences, the quantities deducted in any one year should not exceed a percentage of the annual quota. It is appropriate to fix this percentage at 15\xa0%.\n\n((12)) In a case where the quantity to be deducted in any one year exceeds 15\xa0% of the annual quota, the deduction period will be extended to reduce the quantity equal to or below 15\xa0%.\n\n((13)) Taking account of the request of the Member States concerned to have a smaller amount deducted from certain quotas in 2007 than in the following years from 2008 to 2012.\n\n((14)) The Committee for fisheries and Aquaculture has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nMackerel (\nScomber scombrus\n) and herring (\nClupea harengus\n) quotas allocated to Ireland and the United Kingdom in the years from 2007 to 2012 shall be reduced as shown in Annex I and Annex\xa0II.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe quantities deducted in any one year shall not exceed 15\xa0% of the annual quota.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

31988L0301,"Commission Directive 88/301/EEC of 16 May 1988 on competition in the markets in telecommunications terminal equipment
","COMMISSION  DIRECTIVE
of 16 May 1988
on competition in the markets in telecommunications terminal equipment
(88/301/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 90 (3) thereof,
Whereas:
1. In all the Member States, telecommunications are, either wholly or partly, a State monopoly generally granted in the form of special or exclusive rights to one or more bodies responsible for providing and operating the network infrastructure and related services. Those rights, however, often go beyond the provision of network utilization services and extend to the supply of user terminal equipment for connection to the network. The last decades have seen considerable technical developments in networks, and the pace of development has been especially striking in the area of terminal equipment.
2. Several Member States have, in response to technical and economic developments, reviewed their grant of special or exclusive rights in the telecommunications sector. The proliferation of types of terminal equipment and the possibility of the multiple use of terminals means that users must be allowed a free choice between the various types of equipment available if they are to benefit fully from the technological advances made in the sector.
3. Article 30 of the Treaty prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports from other Member States and all measures having equivalent effect. The grant of special or exclusive rights to import and market goods to one organization can, and often does, lead to restrictions on imports from other Member States.
4. Article 37 of the Treaty states that 'Member States shall progressively adjust any State monopolies of a commercial character so as to ensure that when the transitional period has ended no discrimination regarding the conditions under which goods are procured and marketed exists between nationals of Member States.
The provisions of this Article shall apply to any body through which a Member State, in law or in fact, either directly or indirectly supervises, determines or appreciably influences imports or exports between Member States. These provisions shall likewise apply to monopolies delegated by the State to others.' Paragraph 2 of Article 37 prohibits Member States from introducing any new measure contrary to the principles laid down in Article 37 (1).
5. The special or exclusive rights relating to terminal equipment enjoyed by national telecommunications monopolies are exercised in such a way as, in practice, to disadvantage equipment from other Member States, notably by preventing users from freely choosing the equipment that best suits their needs in terms of price and quality, regardless of its origin. The exercise of these rights is therefore not compatible with Article 37 in all the Member States except Spain and Portugal, where the national monopolies are to be adjusted progressively before the end of the transitional period provided for by the Act of Accession.
6. The provision of installation and maintenance services is a key factor in the purchasing or rental of terminal equipment. The retention of exclusive rights in this field would be tantamount to retention of exclusive marketing rights. Such rights must therefore also be abolished if the abolition of exclusive importing and marketing rights is to have any practical effect. 7. Article 59 of the Treaty provides that 'restrictions on freedom to provide services within the Community shall be progressively abolished during the transitional period in respect of nationals of Member States who are established in a State of the Community other than that of the person for whom the services are intended.' Maintenance of terminals is a service within the meaning of Article 60 of the Treaty. As the transitional period has ended, the service in question, which cannot from a commercial point of view be dissociated from the marketing of the terminals, must be provided freely and in particular when provided by qualified operators.
8. Article 90 (1) of the Treaty provides that 'in the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in this Treaty, in particular to those rules provided for in Article 7 and Articles 85 to 94.'
9. The market in terminal equipment is still as a rule governed by a system which allows competition in the common market to be distorted; this situation continues to produce infringements of the competition rules laid down by the Treaty and to affect adversely the development of trade to such an extent as would be contrary to the interests of the Community. Stronger competition in the terminal equipment market requires the introduction of transparent technical specifications and type-approval procedures which meet the essential requirements mentioned in Council Directive 86/361/EEC (1) and allow the free movement of terminal equipment. In turn, such transparency necessarily entails the publication of technical specifications and typeapproval procedures. To ensure that the latter are applied transparently, objectively and without discrimination, the drawing-up and application of such rules should be entrusted to bodies independent of competitors in the market in question. It is essential that the specifications and type-approval procedures are published simultaneously and in an orderly fashion. Simultaneous publication will also ensure that behaviour contrary to the Treaty is avoided. Such simultaneous, orderly publication can be achieved only by means of a legal instrument that is binding on all the Member States. The most appropriate instrument to this end is a directive.
10. The Treaty entrusts the Commission with very clear tasks and gives it specific powers with regard to the monitoring of relations between the Member States and their public undertakings and enterprises to which they have delegated special or exclusive rights, in particular as regards the elimination of quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effect, discrimination between nationals of Member States, and competition. The only instrument, therefore, by which the Commission can efficiently carry out the tasks and powers assigned to it, is a Directive based on Article 90 (3).
11. Telecommunications bodies or enterprises are undertakings within the meaning of Article 90 (1) because they carry on an organized business activity involving the production of goods or services. They are either public undertakings or private enterprises to which the Member States have granted special or exclusive rights for the importation, marketing, connection, bringing into service of telecommunications terminal equipment and/or maintenance of such equipment. The grant and maintenance of special and exclusive rights for terminal equipment constitute measures within the meaning of that Article. The conditions for applying the exception of Article 90 (2) are not fulfilled. Even if the provision of a telecommunications network for the use of the general public is a service of general economic interest entrusted by the State to the telecommunications bodies, the abolition of their special or exclusive rights to import and market terminal equipment would not obstruct, in law or in fact, the performance of that service. This is all the more true given that Member States are entitled to subject terminal equipment to type-approval procedures to ensure that they conform to the essential requirements.
12. Article 86 of the Treaty prohibits as incompatible with the common market any conduct by one or more undertakings that involves an abuse of a dominant position within the common market or a substantial part of it.
13. The telecommunications bodies hold individually or jointly a monopoly on their national telecommunications network. The national networks are markets. Therefore, the bodies each individually or jointly hold a dominant position in a substantial part of the market in question within the meaning of Article 86.
The effect of the special or exclusive rights granted to such bodies by the State to import and market terminal equipment is to:
- restrict users to renting such equipment, when it would often be cheaper for them, at least in the long term, to purchase this equipment. This effectively makes contracts for the use of networks subject to acceptance by the user of additional services which have no connection with the subject of the contracts,
- limit outlets and impede technical progress since the range of equipment offered by the telecommunications bodies is necessarily limited and will not be the best available to meet the requirements of a significant proportion of users.
Such conduct is expressly prohibited by Article 86 (d) and (b), and is likely significantly to affect trade between Member States.
At all events, such special or exclusive rights in regard to the terminal equipment market give rise to a situation which is contrary to the objective of Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, which provides for the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted, and requires a fortiori that competition must not be eliminated. Member States have an obligation under Article 5 of the Treaty to abstain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty, including Article 3 (f).
The exclusive rights to import and market terminal equipment must therefore be regarded as incompatible with Article 86 in conjunction with Article 3, and the grant or maintenance of such rights by a Member State is prohibited under Article 90 (1).
14. To enable users to have access to the terminal equipment of their choice, it is necessary to know and make transparent the characteristics of the termination points of the network to which the terminal equipment is to be connected. Member States must therefore ensure that the characteristics are published and that users have access to termination points.
15. To be able to market their products, manufacturers of terminal equipment must know what technical specifications they must satisfy. Member States should therefore formalize and publish the specifications and type-approval rules, which they must notify to the Commission in draft form, in accordance with Council Directive 83/189/EEC (1). The specifications may be extended to products imported from other Member States only insofar as they are necessary to ensure conformity with the essential requirements specified in Article 2 (17) of Directive 86/361/EEC that can legitimately be required under Community law. Member States must, in any event, comply with Articles 30 and 36 of the Treaty, under which an importing Member State must allow terminal equipment legally manufactured and marketed in another Member State to be imported on to its territory, and may only subject it to such type-  approval and possibly refuse approval for reasons concerning conformity with the abovementioned essential requirements.
16. The immediate publication of these specifications and procedures cannot be considered in view of their complexity. On the other hand, effective competition is not possible without such publication, since potential competitors of the bodies or enterprises with special or exclusive rights are unaware of the precise specifications with which their terminal equipment must comply and of the terms of the type-approval procedures and hence their cost and duration. A deadline should therefore be set for the publication of specifications and the type-approval procedures. A period of two-and-a-half years will also enable the telecommunications bodies with special or exclusive rights to adjust to the new market conditions and will enable economic operators, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to adapt to the new competitive environment.
17. Monitoring of type-approval specifications and rules cannot be entrusted to a competitor in the terminal equipment market in view of the obvious conflict of interest. Member States should therefore ensure that the responsibility for drawing up type-approval specifications and rules is assigned to a body independent of the operator of the network and of any other competitor in the market for terminals.
18. The holders of special or exclusive rights in the terminal equipment in question have been able to impose on their customers long-term contracts preventing the introduction of free competition from having a practical effect within a reasonable period. Users must therefore be given the right to obtain a revision of the duration of their contracts,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 88/301/EEC of 16 May 1988 on competition in the markets in telecommunications terminal equipment', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n\n- 'terminal equipment' means equipment directly or indirectly connected to the termination of a public telecommunications network to send, process or receive information.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) African swine fever is an infectious viral disease affecting domestic and feral pig populations and can have a severe impact on the profitability of pig farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and exports to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of African swine fever, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other pig holdings and to feral pigs. As a result, it may spread from one Member State to another Member State and to third countries through trade in live pigs or their products.
(3) Council Directive 2002/60/EC (3) lays down minimum measures to be applied within the Union for the control of African swine fever. Article 9 of Directive 2002/60/EC provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of outbreaks of that disease where the measures laid down in Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive are to apply.
(4) Lithuania has informed the Commission of the current African swine fever situation on its territory, and in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2002/60/EC, it has established protection and surveillance zones where the measures referred to in Articles 10 and 11 of that Directive are applied.
(5) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, it is necessary to establish in collaboration with the Member State concerned a Union list of the restricted zones for African swine fever in Lithuania which are the protection and surveillance zones (‘the restricted zones’).
(6) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, the restricted zones in Lithuaniashould be listed in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.
(7) This Decision is to be reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '26.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 222/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 24 July 2014\nconcerning certain interim protective measures relating to African swine fever in Lithuania\n(notified under document C(2014) 5417)\n(Only the Lithuanian text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/502/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) African swine fever is an infectious viral disease affecting domestic and feral pig populations and can have a severe impact on the profitability of pig farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and exports to third countries.\n\n((2)) In the event of an outbreak of African swine fever, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other pig holdings and to feral pigs.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1667/2000(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 800 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

Whereas the aim behind private storage contracts is temporary withdrawal of products from a market in imbalance, without change of ownership, so that they can be put on the market again when the situation has returned to normal; whereas it should therefore be specified that storage contracts may be entered into only for olive oil produced during the current marketing year and ceilings for each country should be fixed;
Whereas only recognized groups and associations may be authorised to store oil produced by their members; whereas in order to enable them to refrain from marketing the oil that they hold, aid should be granted;
Whereas the aim behind private storage must be the improved marketing of olive oil; whereas the period during which storage contracts may be concluded should therefore be restricted; whereas, moreover, the offering of oil for intervention on expiry of the storage contract should be discouraged; whereas it is accordingly desirable to reduce the storage aid if the oil is subsequently offered for intervention;
Whereas it is desirable to specify that entitlement to aid for a storage contract is annulled by the acceptance of an export declaration;

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 7(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, certain Member States have since 2002 submitted information in view of including certain products in Annex II to that Regulation.
(2) Industrial lime, a by-product from vacuum salt production from brine found in mountains, is considered essential for specific soil-conditioning and nutrition requirements in some Member States and has been found not to have any harmful impact on the environment.
(3) Calcium hydroxide has been found to be essential to control a fungal disease in fruit trees in certain climates. The control of this disease in organic production is difficult and requires the use of copper, the use of which can be reduced by applying calcium hydroxide.
(4) Ethylene is already included in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 as a substance of traditional use in organic farming. It has appeared appropriate to complete the conditions for use of that substance in order to cover, besides bananas, certain other fruits for which ethylene is needed in the production.
(5) Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 should therefore be amended accordingly.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 953/2003
of 26 May 2003
to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 21 February 2001, the Commission adopted a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on accelerated action targeted at major communicable diseases within the context of poverty reduction, according to which the Commission was instructed, inter alia, to establish a global tiered pricing system for key pharmaceuticals for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria and related diseases for the poorest developing countries and to prevent product diversion of these products to other markets by ensuring that effective safeguards were in place.
(2) In a resolution dated 14 May 2001 on accelerated action on HIV, TB and malaria, the Council underlined the need to reinforce safeguards against diversion of low priced pharmaceuticals destined for poor markets and prevent price erosion in developed countries markets.
(3) On 15 March 2001, a resolution of the European Parliament on access to drugs for HIV/AIDS victims in developing countries noted the inclusion of a commitment to tiered pricing in the Commission's programme for action and called for a system allowing developing countries equitable access to medicines and vaccines at affordable prices.
(4) Many of the poorest developing countries are in urgent need of access to affordable essential medicines for treatment of communicable diseases. These countries are heavily dependant on imports of medicines as local manufacturing is scarce.
(5) Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, these heavily reduced prices cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets.
(6) Legislative and regulatory instruments are in place in most developed countries to prevent importation, in certain circumstances, of pharmaceutical products, but these instruments risk becoming insufficient where substantial volumes of heavily discounted pharmaceuticals are sold to the poorest developing country markets and the economic interest in trade diversion into high priced markets therefore may increase significantly.
(7) There is a need to encourage the pharmaceutical producers to make pharmaceutical products available at heavily reduced prices in significantly increased volumes by ensuring through this Regulation that these products remain on those markets. Donations of pharmaceutical products and products sold under contracts awarded in response to competitive tenders from national governments or international procurement bodies, or under a partnership agreed between the manufacturer and the government of a country of destination may qualify under this Regulation on equal conditions, bearing in mind that donations are not contributing to the improvement of access to these products on a sustainable basis.
(8) For the purpose of this Regulation, it is necessary to establish a procedure which identifies the products, countries and diseases covered by this Regulation.
(9) This Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Community. Exemptions are laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the countries listed in Annex II.
(10) Manufacturers of tiered priced products must differentiate the appearance of tiered priced products to facilitate the task of identifying them.
(11) It will be appropriate to review the lists of the diseases and the countries of destination covered by this Regulation, as well as the formulae used to identify tiered priced products in the light, inter alia, of the experience gained from its application.
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (1).
(13) With regard to tiered priced products contained in travellers' personal luggage for personal use, the same rules as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 3295/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down measures to prohibit the release for free circulation, export, re-export or entry for a suspensive procedure of counterfeit and pirated goods (2), currently being reviewed, should apply.
(14) Where tiered priced products have been seized under this Regulation, the competent authority may, in accordance with national legislation and with a view to ensuring that the intended use is made of the seized products to the full benefit of the countries listed in Annex II, decide to make them available for humanitarian purposes in these countries. In the absence of such decision, the seized products should be destroyed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 of 26 May 2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the existing preferential agreements between the European Community, of the one part, and Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, of the other part, (hereinafter referred to as 'third countries`) provide that certain goods originating in those countries may, within the limits of tariff quotas or ceilings, attract a reduced or zero rate of duty on import into the Community;
Whereas, following the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, these concessions should be adapted in particular to take account of trade in fishery and textile products existing between Austria, Finland and Sweden, of the one part, and Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of the other part;
Whereas, to that end, exploratory talks are under way with these third countries with a view to concluding additional protocols to the aforementioned agreements;
Whereas, however, as the deadlines were too short, those additional protocols could not come into effect on 1 January 1995;
Whereas, therefore, and in accordance with Articles 76, 102 and 128 of the 1994 Act of Accession, the Community should adopt the necessary measures to remedy this situation; whereas the measures should take the form of autonomous Community tariff quotas and tariff ceilings which include the contractual preferential duty concessions granted by Austria, Finland and Sweden;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 955/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 249 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1662/1999(4), and in particular Article 76 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 of 21 December 1998 applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2001(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1310/2000(6), the Community gave such preferences to Cambodia.
(2) Articles 67 to 97 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 establish the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purposes of generalised tariff preferences. Article 76 of that Regulation provides, however, for derogations to those provisions in favour of least-developed GSP-beneficiary countries which submit an appropriate request to that effect to the Community.
(3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1538/1999(7), Cambodia obtained such a derogation for certain textiles, for the period from 15 July 1999 to 14 July 2000.
(4) The request submitted by Cambodia satisfies the requirements of Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. In particular the introduction of quantitative conditions (on an annual basis) reflecting the Community market's capacity to absorb the Cambodian products, Cambodia's export-capacity and actual recorded trade flows, is such as to prevent injury to the corresponding branches of Community industry. The derogation should be adapted, however, with reference to the economic needs.
(5) In order to encourage regional cooperation among beneficiary countries, it is desirable to provide that the raw materials to be used in Cambodia in the context of this derogation should originate in countries belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (except Myanmar), to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
(6) The open and effective administration of these measures should be ensured by applying the relevant provisions, for the management of tariff quotas, laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1427/97(8).
(7) Any demand to extend application of the derogation beyond the quantities provided for must be considered in consultation with the Cambodian authorities.
(8) To be fully effective, the derogation should be granted for a reasonable length of time, that is, until 31 December 2001 when Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 expires.

on recognition of the ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria under Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
(2012/722/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (1), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (2) as amended by the Directive 2009/30/EC (3), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee established by Article 25, paragraph 2 of Directive 2009/28/EC,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC both lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Provisions of Articles 7b, 7c of and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to provisions of Articles 17, 18 of and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) Recital 76 of Directive 2009/28/EC states that the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry should be avoided and voluntary schemes can help create efficient solutions for proving compliance with these sustainability criteria.
(4) The Commission may decide that a voluntary national or international scheme demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(3) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC or that a voluntary national or international scheme to measure greenhouse gas emission savings contains accurate data for the purposes of Article 17(2) of this Directive.
(5) The Commission may recognise such a voluntary scheme for a period of five years.
(6) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(7) The ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme was submitted on 10 February 2012 to the Commission with the request for recognition. The scheme covers palm oil based products. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC. The Commission should take into account considerations of commercial sensitivity and may decide to only partially publish the scheme.
(8) Assessment of the ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme found it to adequately cover the sustainability criteria in Article 7b(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC, as well as applying a chain of custody methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(9) The evaluation of the ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and also complies with the methodological requirements in Annex IV of Directive 98/70/EC and Annex V of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(10) Any additional sustainability elements covered by the ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme are not part of the consideration of this Decision. These additional sustainability elements are not mandatory to show compliance with sustainability requirements provided for by Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC.
(11) The ‘Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil RED’ scheme was assessed against legislation in force at the time of the adoption of this Commission Implementing Decision. In the case of relevant changes in the legal basis the Commission will assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 91/68/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 2001/10/EC(4), lays down the animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals.
(2) Commission Decision 97/232/EC(5), as last amended by Decision 2002/3/EC(6), draws up lists of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of sheep and goats.
(3) In Hungary Brucellosis melitensis has been a notifiable disease for at least five years, no case has been officially confirmed for at least five years and vaccination has been banned for at least three years; therefore this country complies with the requirements laid down in Annex A, Chapter 1(II)(1)(b), to Directive 91/68/EEC.
(4) Furthermore Hungary undertakes to comply with Annex A, Chapter 1(II)(2), to Directive 91/68/EEC and therefore sheep and goats introduced onto holdings in Hungary must comply with the conditions laid down in Annex A, Chapter 1(I)(D), to Directive 91/68/EEC.
(5) Hungary therefore satisfies the conditions to be recognised as officially free of Brucellosis melitensis and Decision 97/232/EC must be amended accordingly.

(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in animals.

(4) Given the current favourable epidemiological situation in Denmark, the amended national scrapie control programme for that Member State should be approved.

Several fundamental questions were addressed, and the Prime Minister of the transitional government was able to present the point of view of Guinea-Bissau's authorities and their analysis of the situation. The European Union took note of the Prime Minister's commitments to:\n—\nconfirm the transition programme of the government of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and in particular its plans for a general election,\n—\nadopt measures to consolidate public finances,\n—\nconfirm progress towards a return to an independent judiciary and the restoration of civilian control over the armed forces.\nIt was also agreed that an intensive dialogue would be held in Guinea-Bissau over a period of three months on the various points raised, and that the situation would be assessed at the end of this period.\nThis regular and intensive dialogue has been held in Guinea-Bissau. It focused on a series of measures intended to fulfil the undertakings given.\nA number of significant measures have been taken by the authorities of Guinea-Bissau. In particular, we note that:\n—\na fair, free and transparent general election was held on 28 and 30 March 2004,\n—\nprogress has been made towards a return to an independent judiciary with the appointment of a public prosecutor and the election of the supreme court president,\n—\nan emergency economic programme was adopted,\n—\na census of government employees is being carried out.\nThese initiatives are definitely signs of the country's social and political stabilisation. There nevertheless remain issues of concern, especially with regard to the consolidation of public finances, and in particular public accounting, the collection of customs revenue and the payment of the majority of government employees.\nThe European Union attaches particular importance to the following measures to consolidate public finances:\n—\ncontinuing implementation of the emergency economic programme adopted by the transitional government,\n—\nthe continuation of the current census of government employees,\n—\nthe adoption of corrective measures in the matter of public finances, including audits of the financial control system, public procurement and government revenue,\n—\nthe repayment of Community budgetary support following the 2003 audit into the use of resources,\n—\nthe submission of the conclusions of the government auditors' 2003 report on government revenue,\n—\nthe continuation of administrative and judicial proceedings against officials of the government preceding the transition period who committed irregularities or fraud.\nIn the wake of the consultations, it was decided by way of appropriate measures within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, to normalise relations and continue cooperation while monitoring progress made in the areas of public finances, the return to an independent judiciary, the restoration of civilian control over the armed forces and the pursuit of the electoral timetable with the presidential elections. Conditions should be provided in time to ensure that the Presidential elections are transparent and genuinely democratic. The European Union shall regularly monitor progress made in the above areas.\nThe European Union is ready to further a close political dialogue with your democratically elected government and to help consolidate democracy in your country.\nI have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nFor the Council\nFor the Commission""}]}"

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '1.4.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 83/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 509/2005\nof 31 March 2005\nfixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (2), and in particular Article 81(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) It is essential to clearly identify relevant contracts and their respective counterparties. Following a functional approach, entities accessing data held by trade repositories should be considered according to the competences they have and the functions they perform.
(2) The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should have access to all the transaction level data held by trade repositories, for the purpose of trade repository supervision, to be able to make information requests, take appropriate supervisory measures and also monitor whether registration as a trade repository should be kept or withdrawn.
(3) Given its responsibilities under Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (3) and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, ESMA should be given access on different mandates. The access to data by individual staff members of ESMA should be in line with each of those specific mandates.
(4) The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), ESMA and the relevant members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), including some national central banks and relevant Union securities and markets authorities, have a mandate for monitoring and preserving financial stability in the Union, and should therefore have access to transaction data for all counterparties for the purpose of their respective tasks in that regard.
(5) Supervisors and overseers of central counterparties (CCPs) need access to enable the effective exercise of their duties over of such entities, and should therefore have access to all the information necessary for such mandate.
(6) Access by the relevant ESCB members serves to fulfil their basic tasks, most notably the functions of a central bank of issue, their financial stability mandate, and in some cases prudential supervision over some counterparties. Since certain ESCB members have different mandates under national legislation, they should be granted access to data in accordance to the different mandates listed in Article 81(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(7) The relevant Union securities and market authorities have as a main duty investor protection in their respective jurisdictions and should be granted access to transaction data on markets, participants, products and underlyings covered under by their surveillance and enforcement mandates.
(8) The authorities appointed under Article 4 of Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids (4) should be granted access to the transactions in equity derivatives where the underlying is either admitted to trading on a regulated market in their jurisdiction, has their legal address within their jurisdiction or is an offeror for a company for such an undertaking and the consideration it offers includes securities.
(9) The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) should be granted access for the purpose of monitoring wholesale energy markets in order to detect and deter market abuse in cooperation with national regulatory authorities, and the monitoring of wholesale energy markets to detect and deter market abuse under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011 the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT) (5). ACER should therefore have access to all data held by a trade repository as regards energy derivatives.
(10) Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 only covers trade data and not pre-trade data such as orders to trade as required under Regulation (EU) No 1227/2011. Therefore, trade repositories should not be regarded as the appropriate source of information to ACER in that regard.
(11) Under a functional approach for accessing data held by trade repositories, prudential supervision is an essential component. Similarly, different authorities might have a prudential supervisory mandate. Therefore, access to the transaction data on the relevant entities should be ensured to all authorities listed under Article 81(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(12) Entities accessing trade repository data under Article 81(3) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 should ensure that they keep and enforce policies in order to ensure that only the relevant persons access the information for a well-defined and legally founded purpose, also being clear on the possible other persons authorised to access such data.
(13) The access to data should be considered within three aggregation levels. Transaction data should include individual trade details; position data should regard aggregate position data by underlying/product for individual counterparties; and aggregate notional data should correspond to overall positions by underlying/product with no counterparty details. Access to transaction data would also grant access to position level and aggregate data. Access to position data would also grant access to aggregate data, but not transaction level data. Conversely, access to aggregate notional data should be the less granular category and should not enable access to position or transaction level data.
(14) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Securities and Markets Authority to the Commission.
(15) In accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010, ESMA has consulted the relevant authorities and the members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) before submitting the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based. ESMA has also conducted open public consultations on these draft regulatory technical standards, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the ESMA Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of that Regulation,","{'header': '23.2.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 52/33', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 151/2013\nof 19 December 2012\nsupplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the data to be published and made available by trade repositories and operational standards for aggregating, comparing and accessing the data\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) It is essential to clearly identify relevant contracts and their respective counterparties.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 20 August 2013
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan
(2013/440/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) On 28 September 2012, the European Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’) and in Taiwan, lodged pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation by the Defence Committee of the Stainless Steel Butt-welding Fittings Industry of the European Union (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Union production of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings.
(2) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(3) On 10 November 2012, the Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the PRC and in Taiwan.
(4) The Commission officially advised the exporters/producers in the PRC and in Taiwan, importers, users and any associations known to be concerned, the authorities of the PRC and of Taiwan and all known Union producers of the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
(5) All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.
B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By a letter of 27 June 2013 to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.
(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(8) The investigation has not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would be against the Union interest. Therefore the Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. However, the Commission received no comments which would justify that such a termination would not be in the Union interest.
(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the PRC and in Taiwan should be terminated,","{'header': '21.8.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 223/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 20 August 2013\nterminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan\n(2013/440/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of stainless steel tube and pipe butt-welding fittings, whether or not finished, originating in the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan, currently falling within CN codes 7307\xa023\xa010  and 7307\xa023\xa090 , is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Article 29 of the Treaty states that the objective of the Union to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice is to be achieved by preventing and combating crime, organised or otherwise, including corruption and fraud.
(2) The European Union strategy for the beginning of the new millennium on the prevention and control of organised crime emphasises the need to develop a comprehensive EU policy against corruption.
(3) In its Resolution of 14 April 2005 concerning a comprehensive EU policy against corruption, which refers to the communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee of 28 May 2003 on a Comprehensive EU Policy against Corruption, the Council reaffirms the importance of the role and work of the Member States in developing a comprehensive, multi-faceted policy against corruption in both the public and private sectors, in partnership with all relevant players from civil society and business alike.
(4) The European Council welcomed the development in the Hague Programme (3) (point 2.7) of a strategic concept with regard to cross-border organised crime and corruption at EU level and asked the Council and the Commission to develop this concept further and make it operational.
(5) The heads and key representatives of EU Member States' national police monitoring and inspection bodies and those of their anti-corruption agencies with a wider remit met in November 2004 in Vienna at the AGIS conference on the Enhancement of Operational Cooperation in Fighting Corruption in the European Union. They emphasised the importance of further enhancing their cooperation, inter alia, through annual meetings, and welcomed the idea of a European anti-corruption network based upon existing structures. In the wake of the Vienna conference these European Partners Against Corruption (EPAC) met in Budapest in November 2006 for their sixth annual meeting, where with an overwhelming majority, they confirmed their commitment to supporting the initiative on setting up a more formal anti-corruption network.
(6) In order to build upon existing structures, the authorities and agencies to form part of the European anti-corruption network could include EPAC member organisations.
(7) The enhancement of international cooperation is generally (4) recognised as a key issue in the fight against corruption. The fight against all forms of corruption should be improved by cooperating effectively, identifying opportunities, sharing good practices and developing high professional standards.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 92/260/EEC(3), as last amended by Decision 2002/635/EC(4), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses.
(2) Commission Decision 93/197/EEC(5), as last amended by Decision 2002/841/EC(6), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production.
(3) Annex I to Commission Decision 97/10/EC of 12 December 1996 amending Council Decision 79/542/EEC and Commission Decisions 92/160/EEC, 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC in relation to the temporary admission and imports into the Community of registered horses from South Africa(7), as last amended by Decision 2001/622/EC(8), provides for additional guarantees which apply to the regionalisation of South Africa for imports of registered horses into the European Union.
(4) Those additional guarantees require a specific period of residence of registered horses within the African horse sickness-free zone and lay down conditions under which the registered horses intended for transport by air to the European Union must be transported to the airport situated in the surveillance zone under vector-protected conditions.
(5) Taking into account the required isolation in an approved and vector-protected quarantine station, it appears justified to require the same minimum residence period in the African horse sickness-free zone for registered horses temporarily admitted and imported into the European Union.
(6) Due to changes in the schedules of airlines, the transport of registered horses in standard cargo aircraft appears to be impossible, leaving the transport of registered horses by sea the only realistic alternative.
(7) It is necessary to lay down the conditions under which registered horses may be transported without compromising the health status of those animals during the journey by sea from the port of Cape Town situated in the free zone to a harbour in the European Union approved as border inspection post in accordance with Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(9), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(10).

Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products referred to in Part XX of Annex I to that Regulation and prices in the Union for those products may be covered by an export refund.
(2) In view of the current situation on the market in poultrymeat, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products which are authorised to move freely in the Union and bear the identification mark provided for in Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products should also comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3).
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 341/2012 (4). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.

IMI CC 378536 (formerly Penicillium funiculosum IMI SD 101), as a feed additive for chickens, turkeys and ducks for fattening, laying hens, weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use for all major and minor poultry species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2013 (7) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase EC 3.2.1.6 produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has a potential to favourably affect animal performance in chickens and turkeys for fattening, laying hens, weaned piglets and pigs for fattening. Since the mode of action can be considered to be similar in all poultry species, this conclusion can be extrapolated to ducks, guinea fowls, quails, geese, pheasant and pigeons. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase EC 3.2.1.6 produced by Talaromyces versatilis sp. nov. IMI CC 378536 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulations (EC) No 1259/2004, (EC) No 943/2005, (EC) No 1206/2005 and (EC) No 322/2009 should be amended accordingly.
(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.

Whereas it must be made possible to offset the effect of the disappearance of the agricultural conversion rates on the level of certain types of direct aid in terms of national currency in accordance with specific rules adapted to such aid;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (1), and in particular Article 14(3) and 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, provides that when refunds are being fixed, account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availability of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76 (2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) The maximum export refund for rend, medium and long A rice was fixed at a relatively low level. Consequently, it is not justified for the moment to fix a common right to refund for rice.
(5) Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

Consequently, it is not justified for the moment to fix a common right to refund for rice.\n\n((5)) Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.\n\n((6)) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.\n\n((7)) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.\n\n((8)) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((9)) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.\n\n((10)) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.\n\n((11))

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (1), (hereinafter referred to as the Regulation), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 24 April 2001, Monsanto submitted to the competent authorities of the Netherlands a request, in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulation, for placing on the market foods and food ingredients derived from genetically modified maize line NK 603 as novel foods or as novel food ingredients.
(2) In their initial assessment report of 5 November 2002, the Netherlands’ competent food assessment body came to the conclusion that foods and food ingredients derived from maize NK 603 are as safe as foods and food ingredients derived from conventional maize and may be used in the same manner.
(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 6 January 2003. Within the 60 days period laid down in Article 6(4) of the Regulation, reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.
(4) On 27 August 2003, the Commission requested an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in accordance with Article 11 of the Regulation. On 25 November 2003, EFSA delivered its opinion that NK 603 maize is as safe as conventional maize and therefore the placing on the market of NK 603 maize for food or feed or processing is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health and, in that context, the environment (2). In delivering its opinion, the EFSA considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States.
(5) Article 46(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed (3) provides that requests submitted under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 before the date of application of this Regulation shall be processed under the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, notwithstanding Article 38 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, in cases where the additional assessment report required in accordance with Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 has been transmitted to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(6) The Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) in collaboration with the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL), has validated a method for detection of the NK 603 maize. The JRC has carried out a full validation study (ring-trial) following internationally accepted guidelines to test the performance of a quantitative event-specific method to detect and quantify the NK 603 transformation event in maize. The materials needed in the study had been provided by Monsanto. The JRC has considered that the method performance was appropriate for its aimed purpose, taken into account the performance criteria proposed by the ENGL for methods submitted for regulatory compliance as well as the current scientific understanding about satisfactory method performance. Both the method and the results of the validation have been made publicly available.
(7) Reference material for maize from genetically modified maize line NK 603 has been produced by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission.
(8) Food and food ingredients from genetically modified maize line NK 603 should be labelled in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and should be subject to the traceability requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (4).
(9) In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 (5), a unique identifier has been assigned to the product for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003.
(10) Information, contained in the Annex, on the identification of foods and food ingredients derived from genetically modified maize line NK 603, including the validated detection method and the reference material, should be retrievable from the Register referred to in Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(11) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not given an opinion; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 4 February 2004 pursuant to Article 13(b) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 and in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Council Decision 1999/468/EC (6), the Council being-required to act within three months.
(12) However, the Council has not acted within the required time-limit; a Decision should now be adopted by the Commission.","{'header': '21.6.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 158/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 3 March 2005\nauthorising the placing on the market of foods and food ingredients derived from genetically modified maize line NK 603 as novel foods or novel food ingredients under Regulation (EC) No\xa0258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document number C(2005) 580)\n(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)\n(2005/448/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 24 April 2001, Monsanto submitted to the competent authorities of the Netherlands a request, in accordance with Article 4 of the Regulation, for placing on the market foods and food ingredients derived from genetically modified maize line NK 603 as novel foods or as novel food ingredients.\n\n((2)) In their initial assessment report of 5 November 2002, the Netherlands’ competent food assessment body came to the conclusion that foods and food ingredients derived from maize NK 603 are as safe as foods and food ingredients derived from conventional maize and may be used in the same manner.\n\n((3)) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 6 January 2003.

","Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002
of 18 February 2002
establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, presented following consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),
Whereas:
(1) The second subparagraph of Article 119(1) and Article 119(2) of the Treaty provide that, acting on a recommendation from the Commission made after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee, the Council will grant mutual assistance where a Member State is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments. Article 119 does not define the instrument to be used for granting the mutual assistance envisaged.
(2) It should be possible for the operation of lending to a Member State to take place soon enough to encourage that Member State to adopt, in good time in a situation where orderly exchange rate conditions prevail, economic policy measures likely to prevent the occurrence of an acute balance of payments crisis and to support its efforts towards convergence.
(3) Each loan to a Member State should be linked to the adoption by that Member State of economic policy measures designed to re-establish or ensure a sustainable balance of payments situation and to adapt it to the gravity of the balance of payments situation in that State and to the way in which it develops.
(4) Appropriate procedures and instruments should be provided for in advance to enable the Community and Member States to ensure that, if required, financial medium-term assistance is provided quickly, especially where circumstances call for immediate action.
(5) In order to finance assistance that has been granted, the Community needs to be able to use its creditworthiness to borrow resources that will be placed at the disposal of the Member States concerned in the form of loans. Operations of this kind are necessary to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as defined in the Treaty, especially the harmonious development of economic activities in the Community as a whole.
(6) To this end, a single facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States' balances of payments was established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1969/88(4).
(7) Since 1 January 1999 the Member States participating in the single currency no longer qualify for medium-term financial assistance. However, the financial assistance facility should be retained in order to meet not only the potential needs of the present Member States which have not adopted the euro but also the needs of new Member States until such time as they adopt the euro.
(8) The introduction of the single currency has led to a substantial reduction in the number of Member States eligible for the instrument. A downwards revision of the present ceiling of EUR 16 billion is therefore justified. The loan ceiling should, though, be kept at a sufficiently high level in order to satisfy properly the simultaneous needs of several Member States. A reduction in the loan ceiling from EUR 16 billion to EUR 12 billion seems apt to meet this need and also to take account of forthcoming enlargements of the European Union.
(9) The glaring imbalance between the number of potential beneficiaries of the loans during the third stage of economic and monetary union and the number of countries capable of financing them makes it difficult to maintain direct financing of loans granted by all the other Member States. These loans should therefore be financed exclusively by way of recourse to capital markets and financial institutions, these having now attained a stage of development and maturity which should enable them to undertake such financing.
(10) The arrangements for using the facility should also be clarified in the light of experience gained and account should be taken of the development of international financial markets and of the technical possibilities and constraints inherent in recourse to these sources of financing.
(11) It is for the Council to decide whether to grant a loan or appropriate financing facility, its average duration, its total amount and the amounts of the successive instalments. However, the characteristics of the instalments, duration and type of interest rate, should be fixed by common agreement between the beneficiary Member State and the Commission. If the Commission takes the view that the loan characteristics desired by that Member State result in financing that is incompatible with the technical constraints imposed by capital markets or financial institutions, it must be able to propose alternative financing arrangements.
(12) In order to finance loans granted under this Regulation, the Commission should be authorised to contract on behalf of the European Community borrowings on capital markets or from financial institutions.
(13) The financial assistance facility established by Regulation (EEC) No 1969/88 should be adapted accordingly. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be replaced.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) (1), and in particular Article 4(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 14 December 1998, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Decision No 128/1999/EC on the coordinated introduction of a third-generation mobile and wireless communications system (UMTS) in the Community (2) (UMTS Decision) covering the frequency bands 1 900-1 980 MHz, 2 010-2 025 MHz and 2 110-2 170 MHz (‘the terrestrial 2 GHz band’). According to that Decision, Member States were to take all necessary actions in order to allow the coordinated and progressive introduction of the UMTS services on their territory by 1 January 2002 at the latest and in particular were to establish an authorisation system for UMTS by 1 January 2000 at the latest. This Decision expired on 22 January 2003, but the harmonisation of the spectrum has remained in place.
(2) The Commission has since then supported a more flexible use of spectrum in its Communication on ‘Rapid access to spectrum for wireless electronic communications services through more flexibility’ (3), which inter alia addresses the terrestrial 2 GHz band and aims to avoid disruption of the market. The principles of technological neutrality and service neutrality have been confirmed by Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive) (4).
(3) The designation of the paired sub-bands 1 920-1 980 MHz and 2 110-2 170 MHz (‘the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band’) for systems capable of providing electronic communications services is an important element addressing the convergence of the mobile, fixed and broadcasting sectors and reflecting technical innovation. Systems deployed in the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band should mainly target end-user access to broadband services.
(4) Users of wireless broadband services for which the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band is already used today in one Member State can also gain access to equivalent services in any other Member State. However, the unpaired sub-band 1 900-1 920 MHz, although licensed to operators in many Member States, remains largely unused, and the unpaired sub-band 2 010-2 025 MHz is licensed to operators just in few Member States and not used.
(5) Pursuant to Article 4(2) of Decision No 676/2002/EC, the Commission gave on 15 June 2009 a mandate to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (the ‘CEPT’) to develop least restrictive technical conditions for frequency bands addressed in the context of the Wireless Access Policy for Electronic Communications Services (WAPECS).
(6) In response to that mandate, the CEPT has issued a report (CEPT Report 39) containing least restrictive technical conditions and guidance for their application to base stations and terminal stations operating in the terrestrial 2 GHz band. In the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band, these technical conditions are appropriate to manage the risk of harmful interference between neighbouring networks at national and cross-border level without imposing any particular type of technology and based on optimised parameters for the most likely use of the band. In the unpaired sub-bands 1 900-1 920 MHz and 2 010-2 025 MHz (‘the unpaired terrestrial 2 GHz band’) however, the technical conditions contained in CEPT Report 39 are more restrictive for the operation of mobile networks than stipulated in current existing national rights of use.
(7) In accordance with CEPT Report 39 the concept of Block Edge Masks (BEM), which are technical parameters that apply to the entire block of spectrum of a specific user, irrespective of the number of channels occupied by the user’s chosen technology, would be appropriate. These masks are intended to form part of the authorisation conditions for spectrum usage. They cover both emissions within the block of spectrum (i.e. in-block power) as well as emissions outside the block (i.e. out-of-block emission). They are regulatory requirements aimed at managing the risk of harmful interference between neighbouring networks and are without prejudice to limits set in equipment standards under Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity (5) (R&TTE Directive).
(8) The technical conditions defined as a result of the mandate to CEPT also aim to protect existing applications in adjacent bands against harmful interference. For that purpose, compliance with the existing spectrum emission mask for UMTS should be ensured below 1 900 MHz, between 1 980 and 2 010 MHz, between 2 025 and 2 110 MHz and above 2 170 MHz. In so far as coexistence with another radio application is not addressed in CEPT Report 39 and the Electronic Communications Committee’s ERC Report 65, which the CEPT Report 39 uses as a basis, appropriate sharing criteria for coexistence could also be defined based on national considerations.
(9) The results of CEPT Report 39 should be made applicable in the Union and implemented by the Member States taking into account the existing rights of use in the terrestrial 2 GHz band for UMTS and the effective use of spectrum.
(10) However, given the restrictive technical conditions on transmission power levels for the unpaired terrestrial 2 GHz band set out in CEPT Report 39 — in order to protect operations in the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band and ensure coexistence of multiple TDD networks — as well as the limited overall bandwidth of the unpaired terrestrial 2 GHz band, the take-up of wireless broadband services under the current license conditions is obstructed. This situation requires studying alternative harmonisation measures for the unpaired terrestrial 2 GHz band and may entail modification of existing licences. In order not to prevent the early introduction of flexibility of use in the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band, the separation of harmonisation measures for the paired and unpaired terrestrial 2 GHz bands becomes necessary.
(11) Technical harmonisation conditions should be introduced only for the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band without prejudice to the right of Member States to organise the authorisation of the use of the terrestrial 2 GHz band taking into consideration the rights of use in existence under their jurisdiction and in line with Union law, and in particular Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive) (6), and Articles 9 and 9a of Directive 2002/21/EC.
(12) Harmonisation under this Decision should not exclude the possibility for a Member State to apply, where justified and taking into account existing rights of use, transitional periods that could include radio spectrum sharing arrangements, pursuant to Article 4(5) of Decision No 676/2002/EC.
(13) In order to ensure effective use of the paired terrestrial 2 GHz band also in the long term, administrations should continue with studies that may increase efficiency and innovative use. Such studies should be taken into account when considering a review of this Decision.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,","{'header': '7.11.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 307/84', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 5 November 2012\non the harmonisation of the frequency bands 1\xa0920-1\xa0980\xa0MHz and 2\xa0110-2\xa0170\xa0MHz for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in the Union\n(notified under document C(2012) 7697)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/688/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 14 December 1998, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Decision No 128/1999/EC on the coordinated introduction of a third-generation mobile and wireless communications system (UMTS) in the Community(2)(UMTS Decision) covering the frequency bands 1\xa0900-1\xa0980\xa0MHz, 2\xa0010-2\xa0025\xa0MHz and 2\xa0110-2\xa0170\xa0MHz (‘the terrestrial 2\xa0GHz band’).

A BEM is an emission mask that is defined, as a function of frequency, relative to the edge of a block of spectrum for which rights of use are granted to an operator. It consists of in-block and out-of-block components which specify the permitted emission levels over frequencies inside and outside the licensed block of spectrum, respectively.\nThe BEM levels are built up by combining the values listed in the tables below in such a way that the limit at any frequency is given by the highest (least stringent) value of (a) the baseline requirements, (b) the transition requirements, and (c) the in-block requirements (where appropriate). The BEMs are presented as upper limits on the mean equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) or total radiated power (TRP)\n(\n1\n)\nover an averaging time interval, and over a measurement frequency bandwidth. In the time domain, the EIRP or TRP is averaged over the active portions of signal bursts and corresponds to a single power control setting. In the frequency domain, the EIRP or TRP is determined over the measurement bandwidth specified in point B(2), Tables 1, 2 and 3\n(\n2\n)\n. In general, and unless stated otherwise, the BEM levels correspond to the aggregate power radiated by the relevant device including all transmit antennas, except in the case of baseline and transition requirements for base stations, which are specified per antenna.\nBEMs shall be applied as an essential component of the technical conditions necessary to ensure coexistence between services at national level. However, it should be understood that the derived BEMs do not always provide the required level of protection of victim services and additional mitigation techniques would need to be applied in a proportionate manner at national level in order to resolve any remaining cases of interference, also with respect to adjacent bands.\nMember States shall also ensure that operators of terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services can use less stringent technical parameters than those set out below in points A, B and C provided that the use of these parameters is agreed among all affected parties and that these operators continue to comply with the technical conditions applicable for the protection of other services, applications or networks and with obligations resulting from cross-border coordination.\nEquipment operating in this band may also make use of power limits other than those set out below provided that appropriate mitigation techniques are applied which comply with Directive 1999/5/EC and which offer at least an equivalent level of protection to that provided by these technical parameters.\nA.\nGeneral parameters\nWithin the paired terrestrial 2\xa0GHz band, the frequency arrangement shall be as follows:\n(1)\nThe duplex mode of operation shall be Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). The duplex spacing shall be 190\xa0MHz with terminal station transmission (FDD uplink) located in the lower part of the band starting at 1\xa0920\xa0MHz and finishing at 1\xa0980\xa0MHz and base station transmission (FDD downlink) located in the upper part of the band starting at 2\xa0110\xa0MHz and finishing at 2\xa0170\xa0MHz.\n(2)\nThe spectrum block edge nearest to 1\xa0920\xa0MHz starts at 1\xa0920,3\xa0MHz or above\n(\n3\n)\n.\nThe spectrum block edge nearest to 1\xa0980\xa0MHz ends at 1\xa0979,7\xa0MHz or below\n(\n4\n)\n.\nThe spectrum block edge nearest to 2\xa0110\xa0MHz starts at 2\xa0110,3\xa0MHz or above\n(\n5\n)\n.\nThe spectrum block edge nearest to 2\xa0170\xa0MHz ends at 2\xa0169,7\xa0MHz or below\n(\n6\n)\n.\nBase station and terminal station transmission within the paired terrestrial 2\xa0GHz band shall be in compliance with the BEMs in this Annex.\nB.\nTechnical conditions for FDD base stations\n(1)\nIn-block requirements\nAn in-block EIRP limit for base stations is not obligatory. However, Member States may set an EIRP limit of between 61\xa0dBm/5\xa0MHz and 65\xa0dBm/5\xa0MHz in the FDD downlink band, noting that this limit can be increased for specific deployments, e.g. in areas of low population density provided that this does not significantly increase the risk of terminal station receiver blocking.\n(2)\nOut-of-block requirements\nTable 1\nBaseline requirements — base station BEM out-of-block EIRP limits per antenna\n(\n7\n)\nFrequency range of out-of-block emissions of FDD downlink\nMaximum mean out-of-block EIRP\nMeasurement bandwidth\nFrequencies spaced more than 10\xa0MHz from the lower or upper block edge\n9 \xa0dBm\n5 \xa0MHz\nTable 2\nTransition requirements — base station BEM out-of-block EIRP limits per antenna\n(\n8\n)\nFrequency range of out-of-block emissions of FDD downlink\nMaximum mean out-of-block EIRP\nMeasurement bandwidth\n–10 to –5\xa0MHz from lower block edge\n11 \xa0dBm\n5 \xa0MHz\n–5 to 0\xa0MHz from lower block edge\n16,3 \xa0dBm\n5 \xa0MHz\n0 to +5\xa0MHz from upper block edge\n16,3 \xa0dBm\n5 \xa0MHz\n+5 to +10\xa0MHz from upper block edge\n11 \xa0dBm\n5 \xa0MHz\nC.\nTechnical conditions for FDD terminal stations\nTable 3\nIn-block requirements — terminal station BEM in-block emission limit over frequencies of FDD uplink\nMaximum mean in-block power\n(\n9\n)\n24 \xa0dBm\n(\n10\n)\nMember States may relax the limit set out in Table 3 for specific deployments, e.g. fixed terminal stations in rural areas provided that protection of other services, networks and applications is not compromised and cross-border obligations are fulfilled.\n(\n1\n)\nTRP is a measure of how much power the antenna actually radiates. The TRP is defined as the integral of the power transmitted in different directions over the entire radiation sphere. EIRP and TRP are equivalent for isotropic antennas.\n(\n2\n)\nThe actual measurement bandwidth of the measurement equipment used for purposes of compliance testing may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth provided in the tables.\n(\n3\n)\nMember States may decide to reduce this frequency to 1\xa0920,0\xa0MHz for consistency with conditions of existing authorisations.\n(\n4\n)\nMember States may decide to increase this frequency to 1\xa0980,0\xa0MHz for consistency with conditions of existing authorisations.\n(\n5\n)\nMember States may decide to reduce this frequency to 2\xa0110,0\xa0MHz for consistency with conditions of existing authorisations.\n(\n6\n)\nMember States may decide to increase this frequency to 2\xa0170,0\xa0MHz for consistency with conditions of existing authorisations.\n(\n7\n)\nThe BEM level is defined per antenna and applicable to base station configuration with up to four antennas per sector.\n(\n8\n)\nThe BEM level is defined per antenna and applicable to base station configuration with up to four antennas per sector.\n(\n9\n)\nThis power limit is specified as EIRP for terminal stations designed to be fixed or installed and as TRP for terminal stations designed to be mobile or nomadic. EIRP and TRP are equivalent for isotropic antennas. It is recognised that this value may be subject to a tolerance defined in the harmonised standards to take account of operation under extreme environmental conditions and production spread.\n(\n10\n)\nFor the determination of out of band emissions of terminals in CEPT Report 39 the maximum conducted transmit power of 23\xa0dBm has been used as a reference.'}]}"

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 4093/88 of 16 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for new potatoes and certain live plants originating in the Canary Islands (1989)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 4 of Protocol 2 annexed thereto,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, by virtue of Article 4 of Protocol 2 to the Act of Accession and Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1391/87 of 18 May 1987 concerning certain adjustments to the arrangements applied to the Canary Islands (1), new potatoes and certain live  plants originating in the Canary Islands qualify on import into the Community for reduced customs duties within the limits of Community tariff quotas; whereas the quota volumes amount to:
- 6 642 tonnes for new potatoes falling within CN codes 0701 90 51 and 0701 90 59 for the period 1 January to 30 June,
and - 4 700 tonnes for certain live plants falling within Chapter 6 of the Combined Nomenclature for the period 1 January to 31 December;
Whereas for 1989, the duties applicable within the limits of those tariff quotas are equal to 50 % of the basic duties; whereas, however, the products concerned qualify for exemption from import duties on import into that part of Spain which is included  in the customs territory of the Community; whereas, where the said products are imported into Portugal, the quota duties applicable are to be calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act of Accession; whereas to qualify for the tariff quota the products in question must comply with certain marking and labelling  conditions designed to prove their origin;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, allocation of the Community tariff quotas among the Member States would seem such as to preserve the Community nature of the quotas; whereas in order to correspond as closely as  possible to the real trend of the market for the products concerned the allocation should reflect the requirements of the Member States based on statistics of imports of those products originating in the Canary Islands during a representative reference  period and on the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, for 1989, it is necessary to maintain the shares for the Member States given that the administrations of the Member States cannot create, by 1989 a technical and administrative basis for Community administration of the quota; whereas, however,  it is possible, given the evolution of trade over the last few years, to provide for an increase in the Community reserve;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports of these products into each of the Member States were as follows:
(in tonnes) Member States CN codes 0701 90 51, 0701 90 59 new potatoes Live plants 1985 1986 1987 1985 1986 1987 Benelux    21 -     4   144   529   303 Denmark   127   312   180     6     6     6 Germany - - -   220   308   429 Greece - - - - - - Spain    24 -     5 3 880 5 009 4 430 France    38 - -    26    35    89 Ireland - - - -     1     1 Italy - - -    31    44   148 Portugal - - - - - - United Kingdom 6 496 2 531 1 763   177   198   204  Whereas in the last three years the products in question were imported regularly only by certain Member States and not all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be  allocated to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports actually take place in the latter; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure  the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, each quota should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to  cover the subsequent requirements of these Member States where they have used up their initial shares and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree  of security, the first instalment of the Community quotas should, under the circumstances, be fixed at 60 % respectively of the quota volumes;
Whereas if, during the quota period, the Community reserve is almost totally used up, it is vital that Member States should return to that reserve all the unused part of their initial and, where relevant, additional shares to prevent part of the Community tariff quota remaining unused in a Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated  to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4093/88 of 16 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for new potatoes and certain live plants originating in the Canary Islands (1989)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 1.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2000/159/EC of 8 February 2000 on the provisional approval of residue plans of third countries according to Council Directive 96/23/EC(4), lists the third countries which have submitted a plan, setting out the guarantees offered by the third country as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in Annex I to Directive 96/23/EC. Consequently, when these guarantees are not provided, the lists laid down by virtue of Council Decision 95/408/EC of 22 June 1995 on the conditions for drawing up, for an interim period, provisional lists of third country establishments from which Member States are authorised to import certain products of animal origin, fishery products or live bivalve molluscs(5), as last amended by Decision 2001/4/EC(6), should be amended in parallel with the modifications to the Annex to Decision 2000/159/EC. The public health concerns in relation to residues in products of animal origin make it necessary to approve and regularly update residue plans for such products.
(2) Under Council Directive 96/23/EC third countries must each year forward to the Commission the monitoring plans for the current year and the results of the previous year.
(3) When the guarantees foreseen under Directive 96/23/EC are not provided, lists laid down by virtue of Decision 95/408/EC should be suspended in parallel with the modifications to the Annex to Decision 2000/159/EC.
(4) With regard to China, the Annex to Decision 2000/159/EC should be brought in line with Commission Decision 2002/69/EC of 30 January 2002 concerning certain protective measures with regard to the products of animal origin imported from China(7).
(5) Some third countries have presented residue monitoring plans including results thereof to the Commission, but further evaluation, information or clarification is needed.

(2) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. With a view to helping to eradicate avian influenza as rapidly as possible the Union should contribute financially to eligible expenditure borne by the Member States. Article 4(3) first and second indents of that Decision lays down rules on the percentage that must be applied to the costs incurred by the Member States.
(3) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (2) sets rules on the expenditure eligible for Union financial support.

An official request for reimbursement was submitted by the Netherlands on 13 April 2012, as set out in Article 7(1) and 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(5) The payment of the financial contribution from the Union is to be subject to the condition that the planned activities were actually implemented and that the authorities provided all the necessary information within the set deadlines.
(6) The Netherlands have in accordance with Article 3(4) of Decision 2009/470/EC without delay informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures applied in accordance with Union legislation on notification and eradication and the results thereof.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food(1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2), establishes maximum levels for dioxins in certain foodstuffs.
(2) The maximum levels for dioxins apply from 1 July 2002. The application of the text has revealed a need for some clarification of the description of the products or the parts of the product to which the maximum level apply.
(3) Available data indicate that free range and semi-intensive eggs may contain higher levels of dioxin than battery eggs. Measures have to be taken to ensure that dioxin levels in free range and semi-intensive eggs are reduced and a transition period for the application of the levels was foreseen until 1 January 2004. It now appears that more time is needed for the investigations to define possible measures to reduce the dioxin levels in free range and semi-intensive eggs and for implementing these measures. It is therefore appropriate to extend the transition period for one year.
(4) In the meantime, Commission Directive 2002/69/EC of 30 July 2002 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of dioxins and the determination of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs(3) has been adopted.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8, 21 and 22(c) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ammonium nitrate (the product concerned) originating in Ukraine. By Regulation (EC) No 658/2002 (3), following an expiry and interim review, the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of the product concerned originating in the Russian Federation (Russia).
(2) In March 2004, the Commission announced, through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (4), the initiation of a partial interim review of the existing measures on imports of the product concerned originating in Russia and Ukraine (the measures) to examine whether they should be adapted to take account of certain consequences of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States (enlargement).
(3) The Council concluded that it was in the interest of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the existing measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative impact on importers and users in the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union (the EU-10) immediately following enlargement. It was considered that the best means of achieving this was through the acceptance of undertakings offered by the cooperating parties, with elements for minimum import prices and quantitative ceilings.
(4) Accordingly, by Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004 (5), the Commission accepted as a special measure short-term undertakings from: (i) an exporting producer of the product concerned in Ukraine (OJSC ‘Azot’); (ii) an exporting producer in Russia (OJSC MCC Eurochem in respect of goods produced at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot, Russia) and sold by its related company (Cumberland Sound Ltd, British Virgin Islands); (iii) two related Russian exporting producers jointly (Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’ and Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’).
(5) In order to provide for an exemption from the anti-dumping duties afforded by the acceptance of the undertakings, Regulation (EC) No 658/2002 and Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 were amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 993/2004.
(6) It was stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004 that acceptance of the undertakings would be limited to an initial period of six months (the original period) without prejudice to the normal duration of the existing measures and that they would lapse after this period unless the Commission considered it appropriate to extend their period of application.
(7) As set out in recital 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004, the continued acceptance of the undertakings would be subject to an appraisal at the end of the six-month period to verify whether the exceptional and negative conditions for end-users in the EU-10 which led to the acceptance of the undertakings still exist. As part of the overall appraisal, an evaluation of the compliance of the companies concerned with their undertakings was also made.
B.   APPRAISAL
1.   Content of the current undertakings
(8) The existing undertakings offered by the companies oblige them, inter alia, to export in accordance with their traditional pattern of trade to customers in the EU-10 at or above certain minimum import prices (MIPs). These MIPs significantly eliminate the injurious dumping found in the original investigations. Such exports are also to be made within the framework of quantitative ceilings established on the basis of previous, traditional export flows to the EU-10.
(9) The terms of the undertakings also oblige the signatory companies to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a monthly report of their sales to the EU-10 (or resales by any related parties in the Community) and to accept verification visits by the Commission. In order, also, to be able to fully monitor the effectiveness of the undertakings, written agreement was received from the exporters’ traditional customers in the EU-10 that they too would allow on-the-spot verification visits at their premises.
2.   Compliance with the current undertakings
(10) Verification visits to the exporting producers showed that the companies concerned had observed the MIPs and that the volumes exported to the EU-10 had not exceeded the levels of the quantitative ceilings stipulated in the undertakings. In addition, it was found that the companies were broadly respecting their traditional patterns of trade with individual customers in the EU-10. Moreover, according to the information available, there have been no apparent ‘spill-overs’ from the EU-10 into the EU-15 of imports of the product concerned which had benefited from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertakings.
3.   Analysis of conditions for continued acceptance of undertakings
(11) Analysis of the monthly sales reports submitted to the Commission by the companies concerned backed up by available official statistical data showed that although there had been some convergence in prices, a marked difference still existed between the prices for the product concerned in the EU-10 and the EU-15. In addition, it was noted that import volumes from Russia and Ukraine into the EU-10 had declined since enlargement, however, in view of the fact that the period under examination is one of the ‘low seasons’ for the product concerned, they still remained significant. In addition, as indicated in recital 28 of Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, abnormal increases in export volumes to the EU-10 were found prior to enlargement in 2003 and the first few months of 2004. It is considered that this might also have contributed to the decrease in the quantities imported into the EU-10 following enlargement.
C.   CONCLUSION
1.   Acceptance of undertakings
(12) Given that the exceptional and negative conditions which prevailed prior to enlargement and which necessitated that the undertakings still exist, and that the terms of the undertakings have been observed during the initial period of their application by the companies concerned, it is considered that the acceptance of undertakings offered by the companies concerned for a further period is justified.
(13) As concerns the length of this further period, it is considered that a period of application of more than six months would negate the notion of the undertakings being of a transitional nature, therefore, their acceptance will only be from 21 November 2004 to 20 May 2005 (the final period).
(14) With regard to the level of the quantitative ceilings to be applied for the final period, it should be noted that these have been calculated following the same methodology as was used to establish the quantitative ceilings for the original period (however, unlike in the original period when deductions from the traditional volumes were made to take account of abnormal import volumes prior to enlargement, no such adjustments will be made for determining the quantitative ceilings for the final period). Nevertheless, given the trend of increased consumption for this product in the EU-10, a growth factor has been taken into account when establishing the quantitative ceilings for the final period for each exporting producer benefiting from an undertaking.
(15) In conformity with Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect MIPs within framework of import ceilings and in order that the undertakings can be monitored, the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU-10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly, or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor, the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place, or it may adjust the level of the ceiling, or it may take other remedial action.
(16) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way, the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place.
(17) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community, meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission.
(18) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 993/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
2.   Consultation of Member States
(19) In conformity with recital 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004, Member States were consulted on the proposal to accept undertakings for a further period. Certain Member States considered that the level of the MIPs should be raised. It should be recalled, however, that these undertakings are not equivalent to an anti-dumping duty since the MIPs established are at lower levels than would usually be the case. Rather, they serve as a ‘safety net’ below which, prices in the EU-10 should not fall. In view of this and the short-term character of the undertakings, together with the exceptional circumstances under which the undertakings were accepted, revision of the MIP levels at the present time is not considered to be appropriate.
3.   Disclosure to interested parties
(20) All interested parties which had previously made themselves known were advised of the intention to accept undertakings. The Community Industry producers’ association stated that it would not oppose such acceptance for a further period provided that this did not adversely affect its situation. A national producer organisation in Poland echoed, however, the views of certain Member States that the level of the MIPs should be raised since the price levels established did not allow its producers to cover their costs. However, for the reasons stated in the previous recital, revision of the MIPs is not considered to be appropriate at the present time.
(21) One exporting producer in Russia advised the Commission that it intended to export to the Community via its newly established related trading company in Switzerland.
(22) No other comments were received which caused the Commission to alter its views on the matter.
D.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(23) In Regulation (EC) No 1001/2004, customs authorities were directed to register imports into the Community of the product concerned, originating in Russia and Ukraine, exported by the companies from which undertakings were accepted and for which an exemption from the anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 132/2001 and by Regulation (EC) No 658/2002, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2004, was sought.
(24) As acceptance of the undertakings for the original period commencing 21 May 2004, and as acceptance of the undertakings for the final period will follow on directly from the original period, these two periods are to be regarded as one continuous period. In accordance, however, with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the maximum period for registration is nine months; therefore customs authorities should register such imports only until 20 February 2005,","{'header': '20.11.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/24', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1996/2004\nof 19 November 2004\naccepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation and Ukraine and continuing to make imports of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation or Ukraine subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The undertakings offered by the exporting producers mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ammonium nitrate originating in Ukraine and the Russian Federation are hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTARIC additional code\nUkraine\nProduced and exported by OJSC ‘Azot’, Cherkassy, Ukraine to its first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA521\nRussian Federation\nProduced by OJSC MCC Eurochem, Moscow, Russia at its production facilities of JSC Nak Azot, Novomoskovsk, Russia and sold by Cumberland Sound Ltd, Tortola, British Virgin Islands or EuroChem Trading Gmbh, Zug, Switzerland to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA522\nRussian Federation\nProduced and exported by Joint Stock Company ‘Acron’, Veliky Novgorod, Russia or Joint Stock Company ‘Dorogobuzh’ Verkhnedneprovsky, Smolensk Region, Russia to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA532\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 to continue to take the appropriate steps to register until 20 February 2005 imports into the Community of ammonium nitrate originating in the Russian Federation or Ukraine falling within CN codes 3102\xa030\xa090 and 3102\xa040\xa090 produced and sold or produced and exported by the companies listed in paragraph 1.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nand shall remain in force until 20 May 2005.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 26,621 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4147 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Government of the Netherlands has submitted to the Commission on 23 September 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Zuidoost-Brabant; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the authorities of the Netherlands has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/4 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of the Netherlands;

COMMISSION DECISION
of 2 August 2006
updating the Annexes to the monetary agreement between the Government of the French Republic, on behalf of the European Community, and the Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco
(2006/558/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 111(3) thereof,
Having regard to the Monetary Agreement of 24 December 2001 between the Government of the French Republic, on behalf of the European Community, and the Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco (1), and, in particular, Article 11(3) and (5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement between the Government of the French Republic, on behalf of the European Community, and the Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco (hereinafter the Monetary Agreement) requires the Principality of Monaco to apply the measures adopted by France to implement certain Community acts concerning the activity and prudential supervision of credit institutions and the prevention of systemic risks to payment and securities settlement systems. Those acts are listed in Annex A to the Agreement. A number of acts in Annex A have been amended and the amending acts should be included in that Annex. A number of new Community acts falling within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement have also been adopted and should be included in Annex A.
(2) Directive 2001/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 amending Directives 78/660/EEC, 83/349/EEC and 86/635/EEC as regards the valuation rules for the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies as well as of banks and other financial institutions (2) concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions and amends Council Directive 86/635/EEC (3), which is already in Annex A. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should be included in Annex A.
(3) Directive 2003/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 amending Directives 78/660/EEC, 83/349/EEC and 91/674/EEC on the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies, banks and other financial institutions and insurance undertakings (4) concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions and also amends Directive 86/635/EEC. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.
(4) Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements (5) concerns the prevention of systemic risks to the settlement systems. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.
(5) Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate, amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.
(6) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC (7) concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.
(7) Directive 2006/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines (8) amends Directive 2004/39/EC. It should therefore also be included in Annex A.
(8) One act currently included in Annex A should be removed from that Annex. Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 on cross-border credit transfers (9) mainly addresses consumer protection concerns and therefore does not fall within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement.
(9) Article 11(4) of the Monetary Agreement requires the Principality of Monaco to adopt measures equivalent to those taken by the Member States in order to apply the Community acts necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement. Those acts are listed in Annex B to the Agreement. Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA of 28 May 2001 combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment (10) is intended to complete and ensure consistency of the provisions securing the protection of all means of payment denominated in euros. It falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement on the fight against fraud and counterfeiting, notably in modern banking systems. In particular, the inclusion of Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA is necessary to complete the protection by Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA of 29 May 2000 on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro (11), which is mentioned in Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement. It is therefore necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement and should be included in Annex B to the Agreement.
(10) Council Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 of 6 December 2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins (12) is intended to prevent the use of medals and tokens as means of payment in euro and also falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement. It is therefore necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex B to the Agreement.
(11) The Annexes to the Monetary Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly. For the sake of clarity, the Annexes should be replaced in their entirety.
(12) The Monegasque authorities did not request that the Joint Committee established by Article 14 of the Monetary Agreement be convened pursuant to Article 11(5) of that Agreement within two weeks following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 in order to update Annex B to the Monetary Agreement. Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement must therefore both be amended by the Commission.
(13) At its meetings on 17 June 2004 and 16 June 2005, the Commission informed the Joint Committee of the need to update Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement. The Joint Committee took note of the Commission's position,","{'header': '10.8.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 219/23', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 2 August 2006\nupdating the Annexes to the monetary agreement between the Government of the French Republic, on behalf of the European Community, and the Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco\n(2006/558/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement between the Government of the French Republic, on behalf of the European Community, and the Government of His Serene Highness the Prince of Monaco (hereinafter the Monetary Agreement) requires the Principality of Monaco to apply the measures adopted by France to implement certain Community acts concerning the activity and prudential supervision of credit institutions and the prevention of systemic risks to payment and securities settlement systems.

It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should be included in Annex A.\n\n((3)) Directive 2003/51/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 amending Directives 78/660/EEC, 83/349/EEC and 91/674/EEC on the annual and consolidated accounts of certain types of companies, banks and other financial institutions and insurance undertakings(4)concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions and also amends Directive 86/635/EEC. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.\n\n((4)) Directive 2002/47/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2002 on financial collateral arrangements(5)concerns the prevention of systemic risks to the settlement systems. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.\n\n((5)) Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate, amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.\n\n((6)) Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments amending Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 93/22/EEC(7)concerns the activity and supervision of credit institutions. It therefore falls within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex A.\n\n((7)) Directive 2006/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 amending Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as regards certain deadlines(8)amends Directive 2004/39/EC. It should therefore also be included in Annex A.\n\n((8)) One act currently included in Annex A should be removed from that Annex. Directive 97/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 on cross-border credit transfers(9)mainly addresses consumer protection concerns and therefore does not fall within the scope of Article 11(2) of the Monetary Agreement.\n\n((9)) Article 11(4) of the Monetary Agreement requires the Principality of Monaco to adopt measures equivalent to those taken by the Member States in order to apply the Community acts necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement. Those acts are listed in Annex B to the Agreement. Council Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA of 28 May 2001 combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment(10)is intended to complete and ensure consistency of the provisions securing the protection of all means of payment denominated in euros. It falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement on the fight against fraud and counterfeiting, notably in modern banking systems. In particular, the inclusion of Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA is necessary to complete the protection by Council Framework Decision 2000/383/JHA of 29 May 2000 on increasing protection by criminal penalties and other sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro(11), which is mentioned in Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement. It is therefore necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement and should be included in Annex B to the Agreement.\n\n((10)) Council Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 of 6 December 2004 concerning medals and tokens similar to euro coins(12)is intended to prevent the use of medals and tokens as means of payment in euro and also falls within the scope of Article 9 of the Monetary Agreement. It is therefore necessary for the implementation of the Monetary Agreement and should also be included in Annex B to the Agreement.\n\n((11)) The Annexes to the Monetary Agreement should therefore be amended accordingly. For the sake of clarity, the Annexes should be replaced in their entirety.\n\n((12)) The Monegasque authorities did not request that the Joint Committee established by Article 14 of the Monetary Agreement be convened pursuant to Article 11(5) of that Agreement within two weeks following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2182/2004 in order to update Annex B to the Monetary Agreement. Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement must therefore both be amended by the Commission.\n\n((13)) At its meetings on 17 June 2004 and 16 June 2005, the Commission informed the Joint Committee of the need to update Annexes A and B to the Monetary Agreement. The Joint Committee took note of the Commission's position,""}"

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The current legal framework provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 (1) and the additional technical specifications, adopted by the Commission on 7 February 1996 and 27 December 2000, do not allow for reliable searches in the Visa Information System established under Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (2).
(2) The numbering system in use does not allow in particular for sufficient characters to be indicated on the visas issued by Member States with large numbers of applications.
(3) A consistent and unique visa sticker numbering system is therefore essential for the verification in the VIS.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should be amended accordingly.
(5) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis

(7) As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Decision 1999/437/EC, read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC (7).

of 1 March 1990
terminating the review of anti-dumping measures applying to imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and confirming the expiry of the said measures
(90/85/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 15 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Previous procedure
(1) In November 1982 the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities initiating an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and Japan (2).
In December 1983 a definitive anti-dumping duty was imposed with regard to imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic (3) and an undertaking was accepted on behalf of Japanese exporters with regard to products originating in Japan (4).
(2) In July 1988 the Commission published a notice announcing the imminent expiry of the measures in question (5) pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
No request for review concerning the undertaking accepted on behalf of the Japanese exporters was received and the said undertaking duly expired on 16 December 1988 (6).
B. Review requests and initiation
(3) In September 1988 the Commission received a request for a review of the measures concerning imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic lodged by the Association des Producteurs de Fibres de Verre EuropĂŠen (APFE) on behalf of Community producers representing almost all Community production. The request claimed that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures for imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic would lead again to injury or threat of injury. The main basis of these allegations was the continuous rise of imports at low prices and the risk that expiry of these anti-dumping measures might contribute to a reduction in the current capacity utilization and competitiveness of the European industry.
(4) The evidence provided was considered sufficient and the Commission accordingly announced by notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, its intention to carry out a review of anti-dumping measures of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic (1) and the initiation of that review (2). The investigation period covered the calendar year 1988. During the investigation the parties concerned were able to make known their views and provide all information necessary for the determination of injury related to the expiry of the measures. Pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 the measures remained in force pending the outcome of the investigation.
C. Product
(5) The products concerned are continuous glass textile fibres (rovings) falling within CN code 7019 10 51 previously Nimexe code 70.20-70.
D. Results of the injury investigation
(6) The investigation carried out by the Commission services examined the question of whether imports of the goods in question would lead again to injury or threat of injury to Community producers if the current anti-dumping measures were no longer in force.
An analysis of the causality between the non-renewal of the anti-dumping measures and the recurrence of injury was, therefore, made by evaluating the present situation and by assessing the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the said measures.
(7) With regard to the present situation it was found that there had been a large increase in demand in the rovings sector due mainly to more applications being found for composite reinforcements in the automotive industry. This favourable market situation was reflected in the Community industry by a higher capacity utilization, increased production, consumption, sales and market share, steadiness of employment and ongoing or imminent investment programmes.
On the other hand imports from the countries in question have increased at a lower rate than the consumption in the Community and consequently the market share of Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic in the Community market has decreased. It was also found that prices of the products in question originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic had steadily increased and were always well above the variable duty established in 1983.
(8) Concerning the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the anti-dumping measures, the consequences of expiry of the measures were considered in the light of their effectiveness during the period that the duty was in force.
(9) It was established during the investigation that exporters in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic did not only respect the minimum price established in 1983 but continuously exceeded it and increased their export prices between 3 - 5 % annually. It is reasonable therefore, to assume that expiry of the anti-dumping duty would not, on its own, have been enough to substantially alter the situation which prevailed during the five year period nor would it be enough to change the present situation. The anti-dumping measures originally caused exporters in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic to revise their export prices and due to the overall shortages on the reinforcement market, expiry of the duty should not lead to prices falling.
(10) Finally with regard to the foreseeable recurrence of injury or threat of injury after expiry of the anti-dumping measures it was confirmed that no additional capacities in the said two countries were to be expected in the near future.
(11) In view of the above, it was concluded that no change in the pattern of imports from Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic to the Community of the products in question could be expected in relation to the expiry of the anti-dumping measures.
E. Withdrawal of review requested
(12) The complainant advised the Commission by letter dated 4 December 1989 that it is withdrawing the request for review mentioned under 3.
F. Termination
(13) In these circumstances the Commission considers that the review proceeding should be terminated and that the measures remaining in force pending the outcome of the review should lapse forthwith,","{'title': '90/85/EEC: Commission Decision of 1 March 1990 terminating the review of anti-dumping measures applying to imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic and confirming the expiry of the said measures', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe review of anti-dumping measures concerning imports of certain glass textile fibres (rovings) falling within CN code 7019 10 51 originating in Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping duty which remained in force pending the outcome of the review shall lapse with effect from the day following the publication of this Decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nDone at Brussels, 1 March 1990.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No C 310, 27. 11. 1982, p. 2.\n\n(3) OJ No L 354, 16. 12. 1983, p. 15.\n\n(4) OJ No L 352, 15. 12. 1983, p. 47.\n\n(5) OJ No C 172, 1. 7. 1988, p. 3.\n\n(6) OJ No C 97, 18. 4. 1989, p. 9.\n\n(1) OJ No C 294, 18. 11. 1988, p. 4.\n\n(2) OJ No C 87, 8. 4. 1989, p. 3.'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1595/83 (2), and in particular Article 17 (6) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 17 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, a countervailing charge must be levied on imported products when the free-at-frontier offer price for those products plus customs duties is lower than their reference price; whereas the countervailing charge is equal to the difference between the reference price and the free-at-frontier offer price plus customs duties;
Whereas Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 344/79 of 5 February 1979 laying down general rules for fixing the reference price and levying the countervailing charge for wine (3) provides that any wines from third countries, if not included among the wines for which a special reference price is fixed, shall be subject to the countervailing charge applicable to red or white wines, as appropriate;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3400/83 (4) fixed the reference prices for the period 16 December 1983 to 31 August 1984 in the wine sector;
Whereas, in respect of each product for which a reference price is fixed, a free-at-frontier offer price for all imports is determined on the basis of all the available information; whereas the nature of that information is specified in Article 1 (1), (2) and (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1019/70 of 29 May 1970 on detailed rules for establishing free-at-frontier offer prices and fixing the countervailing charge in the wine sector (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1297/77 (6);
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 1 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1019/70, free-at-frontier offer prices must be established on the basis of the most advantageous purchasing possibilities for the products in question; whereas in establishing these prices no account is to be taken of information concerning supplies which have no economic effect on the market, in particular owing to the small quantities involved;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1019/70, the prices must be adjusted if they do not apply free-at-Community-frontier or to a product corresponding to the one whose guide price was taken into account for fixing the reference price;
Whereas the countervailing charge for a product must be fixed per degree/hectolitre or per hectolitre according to whether the reference price for that product is fixed per degree/hectolitre or per hectolitre;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1019/70, the countervailing charge is altered when an appreciable variation in the free-at-frontier offer price is recorded;
Whereas the prices currently to be seen for wine imported in bottles generally stand above the level necessitating the application of a countervailing charge; whereas the countervailing charge for wine imported in bottles should therefore be fixed at 0 ECU; whereas, since the quotations for the other products as well as for wine imported in bulk have not undergone any change, the countervailing charges currently in effect for such products and such wine should be extended;
Whereas this Regulation is intended to replace Commission Regulation (EEC) No 167/81 (7); whereas that Regulation should therefore be repealed;

Whereas, for genetic reasons, the reproductive material must be collected at places of origin  within the natural range of the relevant species and the strictest possible guarantees should be  given to ensure the identity of the material;
Whereas, furthermore, reproductive material should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a  document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question;
Whereas each of the Member States should furthermore be authorized to permit the marketing in its  territory of seed which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of provenance, as laid down  in Directive 66/404/EEC, if the marketing of such material has been authorized in the other Member  States pursuant to this Decision;

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 (2) and (EC) No 2229/2004 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included propisochlor.
(2) In accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/941/EC of 8 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (4) was adopted which provides for the non-inclusion of propisochlor.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(4) The application was submitted to Hungary, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/941/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) Hungary evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 30 November 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on propisochlor to the Commission on 9 September 2010 (6) based on data submitted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 33/2008. The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 24 March 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for propisochlor.
(6) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. In particular, it was not possible to perform a reliable consumer risk assessment and to conclude on a residue definition for propisochlor and its metabolites due to a lack of data on the toxicological relevance of several metabolites (M2 (7), M7 (8), M12 (9), M14 (10), M17 (11), M20 (12), M22 (13) and M35 (14). In addition, harmful effects on groundwater cannot be excluded for several metabolites (M1 (15), M2, M5 (16), M7 and M9 (17) of unknown toxicological and ecotoxicological relevance whose levels exceeded the maximum permissible concentration of 0,1 μg/l as laid down by Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption (18) in several model scenarios for groundwater leaching. Finally, the data available were not sufficient to conclude on the soil, sediment and groundwater exposure for the major soil metabolite M9 and to finalise the risk assessment for aquatic organisms.
(7) The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the results of the focused peer review. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, the Commission invited the applicant to submit comments on the draft review report. The applicant submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.
(8) However, despite the arguments put forward by the applicant, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and evaluated during the meetings of the Authority have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing propisochlor satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) Propisochlor should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of a further application for propisochlor pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(11) In the interest of clarity, the entry for propisochlor in the Annex to Decision 2008/941/EC should be deleted.
(12) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/941/EC accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 of 26 February 1985 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the Arican, Caribbean and Pacific States and the overseas countries and territories (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1821/87 (2), and in particular Article 22 thereof,
Whereas Article 13 a of Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 provides that, during the period 1 July to 30 September iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., var. capitata) of subheading ex 07.01 D II of the Common Customs Tariff and, during the period 1 July to 31 December 1987, walnuts of subheading 08.05 B of the Common Customs Tariff, originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States are admitted into the Community at progressively reduced rates of duty; whereas the benefit of the reduction in duties is limited to ceilings of 1 000 and 700 tonnes respectively, beyond which the customs duties actually applicable to third countries may be re-imposed;
Whereas, within the limits of these tariff ceilings, customs duties are reduced progressively in accordance with fixed percentages for each product, during the same periods and at the same rates as provided for in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas for the period in question the preferential duty is egual to 81,8 % of the Common Customs Tariff rate;
Whereas by virtue of the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of the Decision of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers relating to anticipatory implementation of the protocol of accession of the Kingdom of Spain and of the Portuguese Republic to the Third ACP-EEC Convention (3), Spain and Portugal are to postpone implementation of the preferential arrangements for fruit and vegetables falling within Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1351/86 (5), until, respectively, 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990. Consequently the abovementioned tariff benefit does not apply in Spain and Portugal.
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible re-establishment of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to re-establish customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;

Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1063/2001 of 31 May 2001 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 June 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 May 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 51.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 May 2001 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.'}]}"

of 23 September 2013
amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010 imposing a definitive countervailing duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Iran, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 15(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010 (2) (‘the contested Regulation’), the Council imposed definitive countervailing duties ranging from EUR 42,34 per tonne to EUR 139,70 per tonne on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number of 78 ml/g or higher, according to the ISO Standard 1628-5, originating in Iran, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
(2) On 6 December 2010, the cooperating exporting producer in Pakistan, namely Novatex Ltd (‘Novatex’ or ‘the company concerned’), lodged an application at the General Court seeking the annulment of the contested Regulation in so far as it applied to the applicant (3).
(3) On 11 October 2012, the General Court in its judgment in Case T-556/10 (‘the General Court judgment’) found that the failure by the Commission and the Council to take account of the figure resulting from the revision of line 74 of the 2008 tax return of the company concerned, and the error resulting therefrom, affected the legality of Article 1 of the contested Regulation in so far as the definitive countervailing duty fixed by the Council exceeded the duty applicable in the absence of that error. Therefore, the General Court annulled Article 1 of the contested Regulation in so far as it concerned Novatex and in so far as the definitive countervailing duty exceeded that applicable in the absence of the error.
(4) In Case T-2/95 (4), the General Court held that, in cases where a proceeding consists of several administrative steps, the annulment of one of those steps does not annul the complete proceeding. This anti-subsidy proceeding is an example of such a multi-step proceeding. Consequently, the annulment of a part of the contested Regulation does not imply the annulment of the entire procedure prior to the adoption of that Regulation. Moreover, according to Article 266 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union institutions are obliged to comply with the General Court judgment. This also implies the possibility to remedy the aspects of the contested Regulation which led to its partial annulment, while leaving unchanged the uncontested parts which are unaffected by the General Court judgment. It should be noted that all other findings made in the contested Regulation remain valid.
(5) Following the General Court judgment, on 17 May 2013 the Commission partially reopened the anti-subsidy investigation concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating, inter alia, in Pakistan (‘the notice’) (5). The reopening was limited in scope to the implementation of the General Court judgment in so far as Novatex is concerned.
(6) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers, users and raw material suppliers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the Union industry of the partial reopening of the investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set out in the notice. No interested party requested to be heard.
(7) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of an amended definitive countervailing duty on Novatex. They were granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to disclosure.
B.   IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GENERAL COURT JUDGMENT
1.   Preliminary remark
(8) It is recalled that the reason for the partial annulment of the contested Regulation was that the Commission and the Council should have taken account of the fact that line 74 of the 2008 tax return of the company concerned had been revised.
2.   Comments of interested parties
(9) Within the applicable deadline for submitting comments, the company concerned commented that following the General Court judgment, the definitive countervailing duty for imports into the Union of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Pakistan should be reduced by 1,02 %. Novatex further stated that the countervailing duty applicable to Novatex should be set at 4,1 % or EUR 35,39 per tonne as from 1 June 2010 (the alleged date of entry into force of the provisional duty).
(10) No further comments of any substance on the partial re-opening were received.
3.   Analysis of comments
(11) Having analysed the above comments, it is confirmed that the annulment of the contested Regulation with regard to Novatex, insofar as the definitive countervailing duty exceeded the duty applicable in the absence of the error identified by the Court, should not imply the annulment of the entire procedure prior to the adoption of that Regulation.
(12) The recalculation of Novatex’s subsidy duty rate, taking account of the revised line 74 of the company’s tax return, indeed results in a corrected amount of EUR 35,39 per tonne.
(13) The revised duty rate should indeed be applied retroactively, i.e. from the date of entry into force of the contested Regulation.
4.   Conclusion
(14) Account has been taken of the comments made, and having analysed them it is concluded that the implementation of the General Court judgment should take the form of a revision of the countervailing duty rate applicable to Novatex, which should be reduced from EUR 44,02 per tonne to EUR 35,39 per tonne. As Novatex was the sole exporting producer of the product concerned in Pakistan during the investigation period, this revised duty rate applies to all imports from Pakistan. The revised duty rate should be applied retroactively, i.e. from the date of entry into force of the contested Regulation. However, as provided for by Article 2 of that Regulation, the amounts secured by way of provisional countervailing duty pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 473/2010 (6) on imports from Pakistan can only be definitively collected at the rate of the definitive countervailing duty of EUR 35,39 per tonne, imposed pursuant to the present amendment to Article 1 of the contested Regulation. The amounts secured in excess of the rate of the definitive countervailing duty should be released. In addition, for the sake of transparency, it should be pointed out that Regulation (EU) No 473/2010 entered into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union, namely on 2 June 2010 (and not on 1 June 2010, as stated by Novatex).
(15) Customs authorities should be instructed to proceed with the reimbursement of the amount of duties paid in excess of the amount of EUR 35,39 per tonne for the imports concerned, in compliance with the applicable customs legislation.
C.   DISCLOSURE
(16) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to implement the General Court judgment. All interested parties were given an opportunity to comment within the 10-day period prescribed in Article 30(5) of the basic Regulation.
(17) No comments of substance were received.
D.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES
(18) In light of the results of the partial reopening, it is considered appropriate to amend the countervailing duty applicable to imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number of 78 ml/g or higher, according to the ISO Standard 1628-5, originating in Pakistan to EUR 35,39 per tonne.
(19) This procedure does not affect the date on which the measures imposed by the contested Regulation will expire, namely 30 September 2015,","{'header': '25.9.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 253/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 917/2013\nof 23 September 2013\namending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010 imposing a definitive countervailing duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Iran, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The table in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010 is replaced by the following:\n‘Country\nDefinitive countervailing duty rate\n(EUR/tonne)\nIran: all companies\n139,70\nPakistan: all companies\n35,39\nUnited Arab Emirates: all companies\n42,34 ’\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The revised duty rate of EUR 35,39 per tonne for Pakistan shall be applicable as from 30 September 2010.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The amounts of duties paid or entered into the accounts pursuant to Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 857/2010 in its initial version and the amounts of provisional duties definitively collected pursuant to Article 2 of the same Regulation in its initial version, which exceed those as established on the basis of Article 1 of this Regulation, shall be repaid or remitted.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) In order to reduce the number of road accident casualties in the Community, it is necessary to introduce measures so as to improve the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users before and in the event of a collision with the front of a motor vehicle.
(2) A package of passive and active measures for improving safety (avoidance of accidents and reduction of secondary effects by traffic calming and infrastructure improvements) for vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists, is urgently needed in the framework of the road safety action programme.
(3) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured and to that end a Community type-approval system for motor vehicles is in place; the technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to pedestrian protection should be harmonised to avoid the adoption of requirements that differ from one Member State to another and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.
(4) Pedestrian protection objectives can be achieved by a combination of active and passive safety measures; the recommendations by the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) of June 1999 are the subject of a wide consensus in this area; those recommendations propose performance requirements for the frontal structures of certain categories of motor vehicles to reduce their aggressiveness; this Directive presents tests and limit values based on the EEVC recommendations.
(5) The Commission should examine the feasibility of extending the scope of this Directive to vehicles with a maximum mass of up to 3,5 tonnes, and report its findings to the European Parliament and to the Council.
(6) This Directive should be considered as one element of a broader package of measures, to be undertaken by the Community, the industry and the relevant authorities of the Member States, on the basis of exchanges in best practice, in order to address pre-crash (active), in-crash (passive), and post-crash safety of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, with respect to road users, vehicles and infrastructure.
(7) In view of the speed of technological development in this area, alternative measures at least equivalent in terms of actual effectiveness to the requirements of this Directive - either passive or a combination of active and passive measures - may be proposed by the industry and shall be assessed following a feasibility study carried out by independent experts by 1 July 2004; the introduction of alternative measures at least equivalent in terms of actual effectiveness would require adapting or amending this Directive.
(8) Because of the ongoing research and technical progress in the area of pedestrian protection, it is appropriate to introduce a degree of flexibility in this field. Accordingly, this Directive should establish the fundamental provisions regarding pedestrian protection in the form of tests to be complied with by new types of vehicles and by new vehicles. The technical prescriptions for the application of such tests should be adopted by Commission decision.
(9) The rapidly advancing technology in active safety means that collision mitigation and avoidance systems could provide major safety benefits, for example in reducing collision speed and adjusting impact direction. The development of such technologies should be encouraged by this Directive.
(10) The associations representing the European, Japanese and Korean motor vehicle manufacturers have made commitments to start applying the EEVC recommendations concerning limit values and tests, or agreed alternative measures of at least equivalent effect, as from 2010, and a first set of limit values and tests as from 2005 to new types of vehicles and to apply the first set of tests to 80 % of all new vehicles as from 1 July 2010, to 90 % of all new vehicles as from 1 July 2011 and to all new vehicles as from 31 December 2012.
(11) This Directive should also contribute to establishing a high level of protection in the context of the international harmonisation of legislation in this area, which started under the 1998 Agreement of the UN/ECE concerning the establishment of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles.
(12) This Directive is one of the separate Directives which have to be complied with in order to conform to the EC type-approval procedure established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(3).

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 (3) the Council imposed a definitive duty on imports of certain ball bearings originating in Japan. This Regulation was later amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1238/85 (4).
(2) In 1986 the Commission received a request from Sapporo Precision Incorporated of Sapporo, Japan, to carry out a review. This request contained evidence of changed circumstances with regard to the dumping margin on which the anti-dumping duty applicable to this exporter had been based, which justified the need for review. The Commission accordingly published, in the Official Journal of the European Communities (5), a notice of the opening of a review investigation concerning exports of single-row deep-groove radial ball bearings with greatest outside diameter not more than 30 mm, manufactured and exported by Sapporo Precision Inc., and falling within heading No ex 84.62 of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 84.62-01, originating in Japan.
(3) The Commission officially so advised the exporter known to be concerned and the Community producers and gave the parties directly concerned an opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
The exporter concerned, one importer and the Community producers made their views known in writing and requested, and were granted, hearings.
No submissions were made by, or on behalf of, Community purchasers or processors of the product.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary and carried out an investigation at the premises of the exporter, Sapporo Precision Incorporated, Sapporo, Japan.
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from the applicant exporter and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
B. Normal value
(5) For the purpose of establishing normal value, representative types of single-row deep-groove radial ball bearings were selected which togehter represented about two-thirds of all exports by Sapporo Precision Incorporated to the Community. Normal value for these types was established on the basis of the weighted average price paid for identical types by unrelated domestic purchasers. In those cases where the producer/exporter sold both directly to these purchasers and through a controlled sales company, the combined weighted average of sales prices to unrelated purchasers was taken.
Where Sapporo Precision Incorporated did not sell a type identical to the type exported to the Community, it proved unsatisfactory to establish normal value on the basis of the most similar type sold on the domestic market because the Commission was not satisfied that differences in the production costs of the various types were adequately reflected in the sales prices. For each of these types, therefore, a constructed normal value was established by adding cost of production and a reasonable profit margin. The cost of production was computed on the basis of all costs, fixed and variable, of materials and manufacture and including the actual selling, administrative and other general expenses incurred by Sapporo and its related sales company on the domestic market. The exporter accepted this approach.
C. Export price
(6) Since all exports were made to unrelated importers in the Community, export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(7) Normal value determined as described under paragraph 5 was compared with export prices on a transaction by transaction basis, taking account, where it was requested and could be satisfactorily proved, of differences affecting price comparability; this was the case with regard to commission expenses, transport, packing, financing and handling costs. No other claims were made.
E. Dumping
(8) A margin of dumping of 2,5 % was established for exports by Sapporo Precision Incorporated, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
F. Injury
(9) Since the application for a review was limited to the claim of changed circumstances with regard to dumping, the investigation did not have to cover injury aspects.
G. Community interest
(10) No reason has come to light as to why conclusions different from those referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 with regard to Community interest should be reached.
H. Level of duty
(11) In view of these findings, Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 should accordingly be amended to the extent that it concerns exports of single-row deep-groove radial ball bearings with greatest outside diameter not more than 30 mm, manufactured and exported by Sapporo Precision Incorporated and originating in Japan,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528/87 of 23 November 1987 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain ball bearings originating in Japan and Singapore', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe following entry is hereby inserted in the list headed 'Japan' in Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84:\n\n'Sapporo Precision Incorporated 2,5 %'.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 November 1987.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nU.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The inclusion of prohexadione (formerly prohexadione-calcium) in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC expires on 31 December 2011. A notification was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 of 27 June 2007 on laying down the procedure of the renewal of the inclusion of a first group of active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and establishing the list of those substances (2) for the renewal of the inclusion of prohexadione to as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within the time period provided for in that Article.
(2) That notification was found to be admissible by Commission Decision 2008/656/EC of 28 July 2008 on the admissibility of the notifications concerning the renewal of the inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances azimsulfuron, azoxystrobin, fluroxypyr, imazalil, kresoxim-methyl, prohexadion-calcium and spiroxamin, and establishing the list of the notifiers concerned (3).
(3) Within the time period provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007, the notifier submitted the data required in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 together with an explanation as regards the relevance of each new study submitted.
(4) The rapporteur Member State prepared an assessment report in consultation with the co-rapporteur Member State and submitted it to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter: ‘the Authority’) and the Commission on 22 May 2009. In addition to the assessment of the substance, that report includes a list of the studies the rapporteur Member State relied on for its assessment.
(5) The Authority communicated the assessment report to the notifier and to all the Member States and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the assessment report available to the public.
(6) At the request of the Commission, the assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority, the Authority presented its conclusion on the peer review of the risk assessment of prohexadione (considered variant prohexadione-calcium) (4) to the Commission on 6 April 2010. The assessment report and the conclusion from the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 9 July 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for prohexadione.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing prohexadione may be expected to continue to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to renew the inclusion of prohexadione in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, in order to ensure that plant protection products containing this active substance may continue to be authorised where they comply with that Directive.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before the inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is renewed in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the renewal.
(9) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of renewing the inclusion of an active substance in Annex I thereof, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after renewal to review authorisations of plant protection products containing prohexadione to make sure that the requirements laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13, and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I to that Directive, continue to be satisfied. As appropriate, Member States should renew, where appropriate with modifications, or refuse to renew authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes thiamethoxam.
(2) Commission Directive 2008/77/EC of 25 July 2008 amending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include thiamethoxam as an active substance in Annex I thereto (3) included thiamethoxam as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(3) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, thiamethoxam has now been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(4) Spain was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 2 March 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(5) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 21 September 2012, in an assessment report.
(6) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods and containing thiamethoxam may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to extend the inclusion of thiamethoxam in Annex I to that Directive to product-type 18.
(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. For example, neither outdoor use, nor use by non-professional users were assessed. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(8) In the light of the unacceptable risks identified for professional users in the brushing application scenario, it is appropriate to require that products are not authorised for such uses, unless data are submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of both Article 5 of and Annex VI to Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.
(9) In the light of the risks identified for the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems when products were emitted via a sewage treatment plant or directly to surface water, it is appropriate to require that products are not authorised for such uses, unless data are submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of both Article 5 of and Annex VI to Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.
(10) In the light of the risks identified in several scenarios of use without personal protective equipment, it is appropriate to require that products authorised for professional use be used with such equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to professional users can be reduced to an acceptable level by other means.
(11) In the light of the possible indirect human exposure via consumption of food as a result of those uses presented in the assessment report, it is appropriate to require, where relevant, verification of the need to set new or to amend existing maximum residue levels in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) or with Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (5). Measures should be adopted ensuring that the applicable maximum residue levels are not exceeded.
(12) In view of the risks identified for the environment, it is appropriate to require that product authorisations are subject to appropriate risk mitigation measures for the protection of honey bees.
(13) The provisions of this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products containing the active substance thiamethoxam and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(14) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(15) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(16) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(17) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (6), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1)b of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(p) and listed in Part XVI of Annex I to that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these goods are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) In accordance with the second paragraph, subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed.
(4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.
(7) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 of 26 February 1985 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1821/87 (2), and in particular Article 22 thereof,
Whereas Article 13a of Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 stipulates that products listed there, originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories, are subject on importation into the Community to progressively reduced rates of duty; whereas such reduction of duties applies only up to ceilings above which the customs duties actually applied in respect of third countries may be re-established;
Whereas, within the limits of these tariff ceilings, customs duties are reduced progressively by the percentages specified in that Article, during the same periods and in accordance with the same timetables as provided for in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic; whereas on this basis, the preferential duty rates applicable in 1987 and 1988 must be equal to 80 % and 70 %, respectively, of the basic rates, with the exception of Chinese cabbages and walnuts, for which the rates must be 81,8 % and 72,7 % respectively of the basic rates; whereas, however, the preferential duty applicable to walnuts is equivalent to a reduction of 40 % on the normal duty rate;
Whereas by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of Decision No 2/87 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on the advance implementation of the Protocol to the Third ACP-EEC Convention consequent on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities (3), Spain and Portugal are to postpone implementation of the preferential arrangements for fruit and vegetables falling within Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2275/87 (5), until 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990 respectively; whereas, consequently, the abovementioned tariff concession does not apply at present in Spain or Portugal;
Whereas it is possible that during the period of validity of certain of the said ceilings the nomenclature used in the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System; whereas this Regulation must take account of that fact by indicating the combined nomenclature codes and, where appropriate, the Taric code numbers of the products concerned;
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible re-establishment of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to re-establish customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2944/87 of 30 September 1987 establishing ceilings and Community surveillance for imports of certain products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories (1987/88)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 93/10/EEC of 15 March 1993 relating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2) The Community measures envisaged by this Directive are not only necessary but also indispensable for the attainment of the objectives of the internal market. These objectives cannot be achieved by Member States individually. Furthermore, their attainment at Community level is already provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004.
(3) In order to achieve the objective laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 in the case of regenerated cellulose film, the suitable instrument was a specific directive within the meaning of Article 5 of that Regulation.
(4) Synthetic casings of regenerated cellulose should be the subject of specific provisions.
(5) The method for determining the absence of migration of colouring matters should be established at a later stage.
(6) Until criteria of purity and methods of analysis have been drawn up, national provisions should remain in force.
(7) The establishment of a list of approved substances, accompanied by limits to the quantities to be used, is sufficient in principle in this specific case to achieve the objective laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004.
(8) However, the bis(2-hydroxyethyl)ether (= diethyleneglycol) and ethanediol (= monoethyleneglycol) can migrate extensively to certain foodstuffs and therefore in order to avoid this possibility, as a preventive measure, it is more appropriate to lay down definitively the maximum authorised quantity of such substances in foodstuffs which have been in contact with regenerated cellulose film.
(9) To protect the health of the consumer, direct contact between foodstuffs and the printed surfaces of regenerated cellulose film should be avoided.
(10) The written declaration referred to in Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 should be provided for in the event of professional use of regenerated cellulose film for materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, except those which are, by their nature, intended for this use.
(11) The rules to be applied to the regenerated cellulose films should be specific to the nature of the layer in contact with the foodstuff. Accordingly, the requirements for regenerated cellulose films coated with coatings consisting of plastics should be different from those provided for regenerated cellulose films uncoated or coated with coatings derived from cellulose.
(12) Only authorised substances should be used in the manufacture of all the types of regenerated cellulose films, including regenerated cellulose films coated with plastics.
(13) In the case of regenerated cellulose films coated with coatings consisting of plastics, the layer in contact with foodstuffs consists of a material similar to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs. Therefore it is appropriate that the rules provided for in Commission Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (4) apply also to such films.
(14) In the interest of consistency of Community legislation, the verification of compliance of plastic-coated regenerated cellulose films with the migration limits set by Directive 2002/72/EC should be carried out according to the rules laid down in Council Directive 82/711/EEC of 18 October 1982 laying down the basic rules necessary for testing migration of the constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (5) and Council Directive 85/572/EEC of 19 December 1985 laying down the list of simulants to be used for testing migration of constituents of plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (6).
(15) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
(16) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time-limits for transposition into national law and application of the Directives set out in Annex III, Part B,","{'header': '30.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 172/71', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2007/42/EC\nof 29 June 2007\nrelating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(Codified version)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Directive 93/10/EEC of 15 March 1993 relating to materials and articles made of regenerated cellulose film intended to come into contact with foodstuffs(2)has been substantially amended several times(3).

COUNCIL DECISION
of 6 May 2009
granting mutual assistance for Romania
(2009/458/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 119 thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission made after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
Whereas:
(1) Romanian capital and financial markets have recently come under pressure, reflecting the global economic downturn and rising concerns about the Romanian economy, given its wide external deficit, and the rapidly increasing public deficit. Pressures on the exchange rate have also increased and entail a risk to the wider banking sector stability.
(2) In response, the government and the National Bank of Romania (NBR) have developed a comprehensive strategy to firmly anchor macroeconomic policies and reduce financial market stress and outlined this strategy in a letter of intent received by the Commission on 27 April 2009. A cornerstone of the economic programme is the reduction of the fiscal deficit from 5,4 % of GDP in 2008 to 5,1 % of GDP in 2009 and to below 3 % of GDP by 2011. In order to help a sustainable achievement of lower budgetary deficits, measures will be taken to improve the budgetary strategy and process. This economic programme and in particular the fiscal targets will be reflected in the Government budget as well as in the convergence programme.
(3) The Council is reviewing on a regular basis the economic policies implemented by Romania, in particular in the context of the annual reviews of Romania’s update of the convergence programme and implementation of the National Reform Programme and the regular review of progress made by Romania in the context of the Convergence Report and of the Annual Progress Report.
(4) External financing is expected to remain under significant pressure as the persistent, although declining, current account deficit, together with the need to roll over sizeable short-term and longer-term foreign currency-denominated debt, are likely not to be covered fully by Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and other financial and capital account inflows in 2009-2011. External financing needs are estimated at around EUR 20 billion in the period until the first quarter of 2011. Foreign banks' rollover rate of their exposures to Romania is assumed at 100 % once the mutual assistance is awarded, consistent with the required commitment of main foreign banks to maintain their exposure to Romania (as confirmed in their joint statement of 26 March 2009), whereas the rollover rate for corporate external debt to parent institutions and for external debt of Romanian banks is assumed at 50 % in 2009. For 2010 and 2011, all maturing foreign liabilities are assumed to be rolled over at 100 % in line with the expected financial market stabilisation and start of the recovery in Romania’s major export markets. Apart from sufficiently high foreign exchange reserve target (of more than 100 % of short-term external debt at remaining maturity) conservative assumptions were made about other capital outflows such as non-resident deposit outflows, decreases in trade credits and portfolio outflows in order to incorporate additional buffers into the calculations.
(5) The authorities of Romania have requested substantial financial assistance from the EU and other international financial institutions to support balance of payments sustainability and to bring international currency reserves to a prudent level.
(6) There is a serious threat to the Romanian balance of payments which justifies the urgent granting of mutual assistance by the Community. In addition, in view of the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in paragraph I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,","{'header': '13.6.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 150/6', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 6 May 2009\ngranting mutual assistance for Romania\n(2009/458/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Romanian capital and financial markets have recently come under pressure, reflecting the global economic downturn and rising concerns about the Romanian economy, given its wide external deficit, and the rapidly increasing public deficit.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (2), and in particular Article 29(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the delegated act with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the details of the records and information to be kept by central counterparties (CCPs) adopted pursuant to Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, rules should also be laid down to specify the format of the record and information kept in accordance those Articles.
(2) To carry out their duties effectively and consistently, the relevant authorities should be provided with data that are comparable among CCPs. The use of common formats also facilitates the reconciliation of data between CCPs.
(3) A CCP should be required to retain data for record keeping purposes in a format compatible with the format in which data is retained by trade repositories, taking into account that in certain circumstances CCPs and trade repositories are required to maintain or report the same information. The use of a common format across different financial market infrastructures facilitates the greater use of these formats by a wide variety of market participants, thus promoting standardisation.
(4) To facilitate straight through processing and reduction of costs to market participants, it is important to use standardised procedures and data formats across CCPs as much as possible.
(5) The underlying should be identified by using a single identifier, however there is currently no market wide standardised code to identify the underlyings within a basket.

The use of a common format across different financial market infrastructures facilitates the greater use of these formats by a wide variety of market participants, thus promoting standardisation.\n\n((4)) To facilitate straight through processing and reduction of costs to market participants, it is important to use standardised procedures and data formats across CCPs as much as possible.\n\n((5)) The underlying should be identified by using a single identifier, however there is currently no market wide standardised code to identify the underlyings within a basket.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies (2) provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at a selling price which is not below the price recorded on the market at the place of storage or, failing that, on the nearest market, account being taken of transport costs, for an equivalent quality and for a representative quantity preventing market disturbance.
(2) The increased use of biofuels in Community transport forms part of a raft of measures designed to meet the Community’s environmental commitments. Promoting the use of biofuels may open up a new market for the agricultural products of the Member States.
(3) Germany has significant intervention stocks of rye for which it is proving difficult to find markets and which should therefore be disposed of. To this end, sales on the Community market may be organised by tendering procedure with a view to processing the rye into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community, within the meaning of Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport (3).
(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.
(5) It is also important for the German intervention agency’s notification to the Commission to maintain the anonymity of the tenderers.
(6) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.
(7) To enable checks on the particular destination of the stocks covered by tendering procedures, provision should be made for specific monitoring of, on the one hand, the delivery of the rye and its processing into bioethanol and, on the other hand, its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community. To permit this monitoring, application of the procedures laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (4) and Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (5) respectively should be made compulsory.
(8) To guarantee proper performance, tenderers should be asked to lodge a security which, in view of the nature of the operations concerned, should be fixed by derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, in particular as regards the conditions for its release.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '29.9.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 253/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1573/2005\nof 28 September 2005\nopening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of rye held by the German intervention agency for processing into bioethanol and its subsequent use for the production of biofuel in the Community', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(2)provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at a selling price which is not below the price recorded on the market at the place of storage or, failing that, on the nearest market, account being taken of transport costs, for an equivalent quality and for a representative quantity preventing market disturbance.\n\n((2)) The increased use of biofuels in Community transport forms part of a raft of measures designed to meet the Community’s environmental commitments.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/119/EC(2), and in particular the third and the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), and in particular Article 7(3A)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 25 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Amitraz is one of the 89 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Austria, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 6 January 1998 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifier Bayer CropScience, as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(6) The Commission organised two tripartite meeting with the main data submitter and the rapporteur Member State for this active substance on 9 June 2000 and on 21 March 2003.
(7) The assessment report prepared by Austria has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This review was finalised on 4 July 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for amitraz.
(8) Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing amitraz satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. In particular, Article 5(2)(b) provides that an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for man must be taken into account in deciding on the inclusion of an active substance in Annex I. In setting the ADI the possible neurological effects of amitraz had to be considered. These effects were also considered for setting the Acute Reference Dose, i.e. the estimate of the amount of the substance that can be ingested over a short period of time without appreciable health risk to the consumer. It has not been demonstrated for the proposed uses that consumers might not be exposed to amitraz exceeding the Acute Reference Dose. A probabilistic risk assessment was prepared by the notifier. It must however be taken into consideration that agreed criteria for the interpretation of such a probabilistic risk assessment are not yet established and it would not be appropriate, in view of the possible risks, to delay decision-making further until such criteria are agreed.
(9) Amitraz should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing amitraz are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(11) In the light of the information submitted to the Commission it appears that, in the absence of efficient alternatives for certain limited uses in certain Member States, there is a need for further use of the active substance so as to enable the development of alternatives. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available for the control of harmful organisms.
(12) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing amitraz allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(13) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(8).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95 of 22 December 1995 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1595/97 (2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1926/96 of 7 October 1996 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the agreements on free trade and trade-related matters with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, to take account of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral Trade Negotiations (3), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas Regulations (EC) No 3066/95 and (EC) No 1926/96 provide for the opening, for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, of a tariff quota for 178 000 live bovine animals weighing 80 kilograms or less originating in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and benefiting from an 80 % reduction in the rate of customs duties; whereas management measures should be laid down relating to the importation of these animals;
Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body threaten to restrict access by traders to this part of the quota; whereas there should be provision to correct any harm caused;
Whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for traders able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas, in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported and/or imported during 1997 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load; whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable;
Whereas verification of these criteria requires all applications from the same trader to be submitted in the Member State where the trader is registered for VAT purposes;
Whereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to traders no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 June 1998;
Whereas, to ensure orderly importation of the quantities laid down for the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, the issue of the licences should be staggered over the year of import;
Whereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences; whereas, to this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1044/98 (5), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 759/98 (7); whereas, moreover, it should be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed percentage reduction applied;

Whereas by Decision 89/563/EEC (3) the Commission approved the plan for the accelerated eradication of classical swine fever presented by Greece, which has been implemented on a regional basis;
Whereas, following a favourable development of the disease situation, the Commission adopted Decision 87/362/EEC (4), recognizing certain parts of the territory of the Hellenic Republic as officially swine fever free;
Whereas Greece at this moment complies with the criteria laid down in Article 7 (1) and Point 2 of the second subparagraph of Article 2 of Directive 80/1095/EEC for being recognized as an officially swine fever-free Member State within the context of eradication; in fact, no swine fever has been detected and vaccination against swine fever has been stopped for more than 12 months in Greece and holdings in Greece contain no pigs which have been vaccinated against swine fever in the preceding 12 months;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 an application was submitted for the authorisation of L-tyrosine as a feed additive in the functional group ‘amino acids, their salts and analogues’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) That application concerns the authorisation of L-tyrosine as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 20 June 2013 (2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, L-tyrosine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that it may be considered efficacious to contribute to the requirements for sulphur-containing amino acids in all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of that substance shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

of 25 February 2005
amending Decision 94/140/EC setting up an advisory committee for the coordination of fraud prevention
(2005/223/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) By Commission Decision 94/140/EC (1), the Commission set up an advisory committee for the coordination of fraud prevention (the committee) attached to it and responsible for advising it on any matter relating to the prevention and prosecution of fraud and irregularities and to cooperation between Member States or between Member States and the Commission to counter fraud.
(2) Since the committee was set up, the Community provisions for the protection of the financial interests of the Community have been substantially developed and strengthened, in particular by new legislative measures and organisational changes in the Commission.
(3) General rules defining irregularities and laying down related measures and penalties in the field of the protection of the financial interests of the Community were adopted in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 (2), and specific rules applicable to all areas of Community activity concerning on-the-spot administrative checks and inspections carried out by the Commission were adopted in Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 (3).
(4) Article 280, inserted in the EC Treaty by the Treaty of Amsterdam, provided a new institutional framework for the fight against fraud; it provides in particular for powers to be shared between the Community and the Member States and for close and regular cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission for the protection of the financial interests of the Community.
(5) Commission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom (4), established the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) as the service responsible for administrative anti-fraud investigations, extending to all the activities linked with the protection of Community interests from irregular acts likely to lead to administrative or criminal proceedings.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Council Regulation (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (6) determined the legal framework for OLAF’s activities, making it responsible in particular for ensuring cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission for the coordination of action to protect the financial interests of the Community against fraud.
(7) In the field of protecting the euro against counterfeiting, the Commission has been given specific responsibility for ensuring the overall protection of the single currency by means of consultations within an advisory committee under Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 (7) in the context of close and regular cooperation between the national authorities and the Commission itself. Council Decision 2001/923/EC (8) gave the Commission responsibility for managing and implementing a Community exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (the Pericles programme) in cooperation with the Member States.
(8) Given these new dimensions in Community legislation and the committee’s horizontal function, the committee’s advisory powers should be adapted, as should the representation on it of the Member States, whose representatives must be able to be assisted by the competent national authorities. In the interests of flexibility there should also be provision for the possibility of setting up sectoral working parties.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 (2) provides for a system of disposal of wine alcohol by invitation to tender for use as bio-ethanol in the fuel sector in the Community. In order to enable the highest selling price to be obtained for such alcohol, the conditions for competition on the wine alcohol market should be improved.
(2) To that end, firstly, an increase in the number of tenderers should be encouraged by simplifying the approval procedure. Secondly, where applicable, those undertakings should have the possibility of freely choosing on the market the clients to whom they will sell on the processed alcohol for its final use.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas pursuant to Article 27 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of that Directive in order to  simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas the United Kingdom was authorized by Decision 90/127/EEC (2), in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 27 (1) to (4) of Directive 77/388/EEC to apply a measure derogating from Articles 5 (8) and 21 (1) (a) of the said Directive;
Whereas the United Kingdom, by means of a letter dated 16 November 1992 and received by the Commission on 18 November 1992, requested authorization to extend the said derogation until 31 December 1996;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 18 December 1992 of the United Kingdom's request;
Whereas the purpose of the derogation is to prevent groups of enterprises which are treated as a single taxable person within the meaning of Article 4 (4) of Directive 77/388/EEC and which are not entitled to deduct tax in full from being able to  benefit from full deduction of the tax on certain transfers of assets made in the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 5 (8) of that Directive;
Whereas pursuant to Article 5 (8) of Directive 77/388/EEC Member States may, in the event of a transfer, whether for consideration or not or as a contribution to a company, of a totality of assets or part thereof, consider that no supply of goods has  taken place and that the recipient is to be treated as the successor to the transferor;
Whereas the United Kingdom makes general use of the option provided for in the said Article 5 (8);
Whereas, therefore, the measure planned by the United Kingdom derogates from the said Article 5 (8) in that a supply is deemed to take place where part of a totality of assets is transferred to a company which, as a member of a group of enterprises  which are treated as a single taxable person within the meaning of Article 4 (4) of that Directive, is not entitled to deduct tax in full;
Whereas the measure planned by the United Kingdom also constitutes a derogation form Article 21 (1) (a) of Directive 77/388/EEC according to which, under the internal system, the person liable for the tax is the taxable person who carries out the  taxable transaction;
Whereas that derogation will have a favourable effect on the European Communities' own resources from value added tax,","{'title': '93/204/EEC: Council Decision of 5 April 1993 authorizing the United Kingdom to apply a measure derogating from Articles 5 (8) and 21 (1) (a) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Articles 5 (8) and 21 (1) (a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the United Kingdom is hereby authorized to apply until 31 December 1996:\n\n- a provision whereby a supply of goods is deemed to occur where assets, other than the capital goods subject to adjustment of the deductions initially made pursuant to legislation adopted by the United Kingdom on the basis of Article 20 of the said  Directive, are totally or partially transferred to a company which is a member of a group of enterprises treated as a single taxable person within the meaning of Article 4 (4) of that Directive and which, as a member of that group, is not entitled to  deduct tax in full,\n\n- a provision whereby the company which is the recipient of the supply of assets referred to in the first indent becomes liable to tax.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 5 April 1993.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nN.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996 laying down a Community procedure for flavouring substances used or intended for use in or on foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 3(2) and Article 4(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 lays down the procedure for the establishment of rules in respect of flavouring substances used or intended to be used in foodstuffs. That Regulation provides for the adoption of a register of flavouring substances (the register) following notification by the Member States of a list of the flavouring substances which may be used in or on foodstuffs marketed in their territory and on the basis of scrutiny by the Commission of that notification. That register was adopted by Commission Decision 1999/217/EC (2).
(2) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 provides for a programme for the evaluation of flavouring substances in order to check whether they comply with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in the Annex to that Regulation.
(3) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 13 July 2004 on para-hydroxybenzoates, that propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (FL 09.915) had effects on sex hormones and the male reproductive organs in juvenile rats. The Authority was unable to recommend an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for this substance because of the lack of clear no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL). The use of propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate as a flavouring substance in food is not acceptable, as it does not comply with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96. As a consequence, propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate should be deleted from the register.
(4) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 7 December 2004 on aliphatic dialcohols, diketones and hydroxyketones, that pentane-2,4-dione (FL 07.191) is genotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Accordingly, its use as a flavouring substance is not acceptable, because it does not comply with the general criteria for the use of flavouring substances set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2232/96. As a consequence, pentane-2,4-dione should be deleted from the register.
(5) In application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 and Commission Recommendation 98/282/EC of 21 April 1998 on the ways in which the Member States and the signatory States to the Agreement on the European Economic Area should protect intellectual property in connection with the development and manufacture of flavouring substances referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), for a number of substances, the notifying Member States requested that they should be registered in such a way as to protect the intellectual property rights of the manufacturer.
(6) Protection for these substances, listed in Part B of the register, is limited to a maximum period of five years following the date of receipt of the notification. That period has now expired for 28 substances which should consequently be transferred to Part A of the register.
(7) Decision 1999/217/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '21.5.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 128/73', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 18 May 2005\namending Decision 1999/217/EC as regards the register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs\n(notified under document number C(2005) 1437)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/389/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 lays down the procedure for the establishment of rules in respect of flavouring substances used or intended to be used in foodstuffs.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 sets up a system of pilot and derived products, in order to enable additional amounts to be fixed for those products for which there is no sluice-gate price (called derived products), on the basis of the additional amounts fixed for the pilot products; whereas the list of pilot products and derived products was laid down by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2767/75 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 220/83 (4);
Whereas it has become clear that sluice-gate prices can be fixed for certain products which until now have figured in the list of derived products;
Whereas the application of the system of pilot and derived products has given rise to certain problems; whereas the additional amounts to which the system can lead, do not correspond in all cases to the market requirements; whereas therefore the application of the system should be limited to a smaller number of products,","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EEC) No 1906/83 of 11 July 1983 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2767/75 laying down general rules for the system of 'pilot products and derived products' enabling additional amounts to be fixed for pigmeat"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 2767/75 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 410/97 of 24 February 1997 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,

Whereas an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part (4), hereinafter referred to as the 'Agreement`, was signed in Brussels on 11 November 1996; whereas pending the entry into force of the Europe Agreement, the Council and Commission have decided that the Agreement is to apply provisionally in the Community from 1 January 1997;
Whereas the Agreement provides for the opening of a reduced-tariff quota for beef and veal for 1997; whereas detailed rules for the application of that quota should therefore be laid down;
Whereas, in order to ensure orderly importation of the quantities laid down, they should be staggered;
Whereas the arrangements should be managed using import licences; whereas to that end rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where appropriate by way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for certain agricultural products (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2402/96 (6), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 266/97 (8); whereas, moreover, it should be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and, where necessary, after application of a uniform percentage reduction;
Whereas, in order to ensure efficient management of the arrangements, a security against import licences of ECU 12 per 100 kilograms should be required; whereas, given the risk of speculation inherent in the arrangements in the beef and veal sector, detailed conditions for access to the quotas should be laid down;
Whereas experience has shown that importers do not always inform the authorities which have issued the import licences of the quantity and origin of the beef and veal imported under the quotas concerned; whereas that information is important for assessing the market situation; whereas a security relating to provision of that information should be provided for;
Whereas the Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not reached an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 481/97 of 14 March 1997 laying down for 1997 detailed rules for the application of the tariff quota for beef and veal provided for in the Interim Agreement between the Community and the Republic of Slovenia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas wine-growing areas recognized as suitable for the production of quality wines psr, located in certain areas with special constraints are covered by this Regulation; whereas those areas are determined on the basis of four factors; whereas the following factors in combination are involved:
- qualification for a designation of origin, to avoid calling into question quality policies;
- an annual average rainfall less than or equal to 400 mm,
- very limited possibilities of alternative crops, shown by the possibilities of crop rotation, irrigation and classes of yield, obtained on the basis of land tenure, production and agro-climatic study data;
those technical indices enable geographical areas with average to high agronomic constraints to be determined;
- existence of a risk of depopulation, through the use of population criteria - percentage of working farming population in comparison to total working population, population density and annual rate of fall - used for the determination of less-favoured areas,

Whereas the Community currently depends on imports from third countries for its supplies of boysenberries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to suspend partially the customs duty on the products in question within the limits of a Community  tariff quota of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to harm the prospects for increasing fruit production within the Community, while at the same time making adequate supplies available to user industries, the tariff quota should be limited to  1 500 tonnes and opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1989 at a duty of 15 %;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quota is  exhausted; whereas, however, the quota should not in this case be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volume of such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to the procedure laid  down in Article 2 (1); whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is used and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if, during the quota period, the tariff quota is almost totally used up, it is indispensable that Member States return to this quota the entirety of the drawings made which have not been used, in order to avoid one part of the Community tariff  quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;

of 29 August 2011
setting up a Payment Systems Market Expert Group
2011/C 253/04
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Whereas:
(1) One of the main objectives of the Union is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, of which payment services are an essential part. In a context of rapid innovation and technological progress, it is important for the internal market to have sound, user-friendly, efficient and secure payment systems, for the benefit of service providers and users alike.
(2) In accordance with the better regulation principles, the Commission attaches great importance to properly consulting relevant stakeholders, in particular payment service providers and users, including consumers and other representatives of civil society, in developing policy regarding payment systems. For this purpose, the Commission may need to call upon the expertise of specialists in an advisory body.
(3) A group of experts in the field of payment systems has therefore been set up by Commission Decision 2009/72/EC (1).
(4) As stated in its White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010, the Commission attaches high importance to having the views of users adequately represented in the course of developing and implementing policy. Therefore, the Group should enable the views of relevant interested parties to be represented appropriately. The Commission considers that the current composition of the Group is not sufficiently reflecting the views of users, in particular consumers. The establishment of the Group is therefore re-cast to better balance representation between payment service providers and users and to increase the number of members representing consumers.
(5) The Group should be composed of individuals with the requisite expertise in the area of payment systems. It should, however, be limited to representatives of private stakeholders, since public authorities and central banks have their own consultative group in the field of payment systems.
(6) The Group should assist the Commission in the preparation and in the implementation of policy regarding payment systems.
(7) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the Group should be provided for, without prejudice to the rules on security annexed to the Commission’s Rules of Procedure by Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom (2).
(8) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3) governs the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the Group.
(9) Commission Decision 2009/72/EC of 15 December 2008 setting up a Payment Systems Market Expert Group should be repealed.
(10) It is appropriate to fix a period of application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension,",{'header': '30.8.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 253/3'}

ELHASSAN held this position as Western Military Area Commander from November 2004 (approx.) – early 2006. The Panel’s information is that ELHASSAN was responsible for violations of paragraph 7 of SCR 1591 as by virtue of this position he requested (from Khartoum) and authorized (since 29 March 2005) the transfer of military equipment into Darfur without the prior approval of the 1591 Committee. ELHASSAN himself admitted to the Panel of Experts that aircraft, aircraft engines and other military equipment had been brought into Darfur from other parts of Sudan between 29 March 2005 and December 2005. For example he informed the Panel that 2 Mi-24 attack helicopters were brought unauthorized into Darfur between 18 and 21 September 2005.\nThere are also reasonable grounds to believe that ELHASSAN was directly responsible, as Western Military Area Commander, for authorizing offensive military flights in the area around Abu Hamra, 23-24 July 2005 and in the Jebel Moon area of Western Darfur, on 19 November 2005. Mi-24 attack helicopters were involved in both operations and reportedly opened fire on both occasions. The Panel of Experts report that ELHASSAN indicated to the Panel that he himself approved requests for air support and other air operations in his capacity as Western Military Area Commander. (See Panel of Experts report, S/2006/65, paragraphs 266-269.) Through such actions Major-General Gaffar Mohammed ELHASSAN has breached relevant provisions of SCR 1591 and therefore meets the criteria to be designated by the Committee to be subjected to sanctions.\n2.\nSurname, first name(s)\n: HILAL, (Sheikh) Musa.\nOther information\n:\n(a)\nParamount Chief of the Jalul Tribe in North Darfur.\n(b)\nMember of the National Assembly of Sudan.\n(c)\nIn 2008, appointed by the President of Sudan as special adviser to the Ministry of Federal Affairs.\nDate of UN designation\n: 25 April 2006\nAdditional information from the narrative summary of grounds for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:\nReport from Human Rights Watch states they have a memo dated 13 February 2004 from a local government office in North Darfur ordering “security units in the locality” to “allow the activities of the mujahideen and the volunteers under the command of the Sheikh Musa HILAL to proceed in the areas of [North Darfur] and to secure their vital needs”. On 28 September 2005, 400 Arab militia attacked the villages of Aro Sharrow (including its IDP camp), Acho, and Gozmena in West Darfur. We also believe that Musa HILAL was present during the attack on Aro Sharrow IDP camp: his son had been killed during the SLA attack on Shareia, so he was now involved in a personal blood feud. There are reasonable grounds to believe that as the Paramount Chief he had direct responsibility for these actions and is responsible for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law and other atrocities.\n3.\nSurname, first name(s)\n: SHARIF, Adam Yacub\n(\nalias\n(a)\nAdam Yacub Shant,\n(b)\nAdam Yacoub)\nDate of birth\n: Circa 1976.\nOther information\n:\n(a)\nSudanese Liberation Army (SLA) Commander.\n(b)\nReportedly deceased on 7 June 2012.\nDate of UN designation\n: 25 April 2006\nAdditional information from the narrative summary of grounds for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:\nSLA soldiers under the command of Adam Yacub Shant violated the ceasefire agreement by attacking a Government of Sudan military contingent that was escorting a convoy of trucks near Abu Hamra, Northern Darfur on July 23, 2005, killing three soldiers. After the attack Government military weapons and ammunition were looted. The Panel of Experts has information establishing that the attack by SLA soldiers took place and was clearly organized; consequently it was well planned. It is therefore reasonable to assume, as the Panel concluded, that Shant, as the confirmed SLA Commander in the area, must have had knowledge of and approved/or ordered the attack. He therefore bears direct responsibility for the attack and meets the criteria for being listed.\n4.\nSurname, first name(s)\n: BAREY Gabril Abdul Kareem\n(\nalias\n(a)\nGeneral Gibril Abdul Kareem BAREY,\n(b)\n“Tek”).\nAddress\n: Resides in Tine, on the Sudanese side of the border with Chad.\nOther information\n: National Movement for Reform and Development (NMRD) Field Commander.\nDate of UN designation\n: 25 April 2006\nAdditional information from the narrative summary of grounds for listing provided by the Sanctions Committee:\nBAREY is responsible for the kidnapping of African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) personnel in Darfur during October 2005. BAREY openly attempts to thwart the AMIS mission through intimidation; for example he threatened to shoot down African Union (AU) helicopters in the Jebel Moon area in November 2005. Through such actions BAREY has clearly violated SCR 1591 in constituting a threat to stability in Darfur and meets the criteria to be designated by the Committee to be subjected to sanctions.’'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In the United Kingdom the quantity of available seed of winter varieties of field beans (Vicia faba L.) suitable to the national climatic conditions and which satisfies the germination capacity requirements of Directive 66/401/EEC is insufficient and is therefore not adequate to meet the needs of that Member State.
(2) It is not possible to meet the demand for seed of that species satisfactorily with seed from other Member States or from third countries which satisfies all the requirements laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC.
(3) Accordingly, the United Kingdom should be authorised to permit the marketing of seed of that species subject to less stringent requirements for a period expiring on 30 November 2003.
(4) In addition, other Member States irrespective of whether the seed was harvested in a Member State or in a third country covered by the Council Decision 2003/17/EC of 16 December 2002 on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries(3), as last amended by Decision 2003/403/EC(4), which are in a position to supply the United Kingdom with seed of that species, should be authorised to permit the marketing of such seed.
(5) It is appropriate that the United Kingdom act as coordinator in order to ensure that the total amount of seed authorised pursuant to this Decision does not exceed the maximum quantity covered by this Decision.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Following the negotiations in the framework of the Uruguay Round, provision was made in the Combined Nomenclature (CN), laid down in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (1), for an exemption from tariff duties for pharmaceutical products falling under Chapter 30 of the CN.
(2) Sterile surgical or dental adhesion barriers, whether or not absorbable, and appliances identifiable for ostomy use are currently classified in different chapters of the CN and are subject to a 6,5 % rate of duty. However, after 1 January 2007, they are to be classified in Chapter 30 of the CN as a result of the amendments to the Nomenclature appended as an annex to the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, accepted pursuant to the Recommendation of 26 June 2004 of the Customs Co-operation Council.
(3) For reasons of public health, it is in the Community interest to extend autonomously to those goods the exemption for pharmaceutical products falling under Chapter 30 of the CN. That should be done by means of a suspension of duties for an indefinite period.
(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Since the amendment introduced by this Regulation is to be applied from the same date as the CN for 2007, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1549/2006 (2), this Regulation should enter into force immediately and apply from 1 January 2007.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 47/2003(2), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1176/2002(4), lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported, the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds.
(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(4) Under Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) Application of the above rules to the present and forecast market situation, and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade, gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto.
(9) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables, quotas should be fixed for each product.
(10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(8), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(12) Owing to the market situation, in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports, the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A1, A2 and A3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.
(13) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund, taking account in particular of their perishability.
(14) It should be specified that Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001, and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof, are to apply to this invitation to tender.

Whereas the market situation has been characterized by a marked fall in prices below the level  mentioned; whereas, in view of seasonal and cyclical trends, this situation could persist;
Whereas intervention measures must be taken; whereas these can be limited to the granting of  private storage aid;
Whereas Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2763/75  (3) and Article 9 (4) of Commission  Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90  (4), provides for the possibility of custailing or extending the  storage period; whereas, therefore, provision should be made to fix not only the amounts of aid for  a specific period of storage but also the amounts to be added or deducted if this period is  curtailed or extended;
Whereas, in order to facilitate administrative and control work resulting from the conclusion of  contracts, minimum quantities should be fixed;
Whereas the security should be fixed at a level such as will oblige the storer to fulfil the  obligations undertaken by him;
Wheras experience shows that in certain circumstances and in particular where excessive use is made  of the scheme there is a risk of abuses in applying it;
Whereas decisions on applications to conclude contracts should be notified only after a period for  reflection has elapsed; whereas that period must allow the market situation to be assessed and  permit provision to be made, where appropriate, for special measures applying in particular to  applications pending;

Whereas it is essential, in order to protect public health, to keep contaminant levels at contents which are toxicologically acceptable; whereas contaminants must be eliminated more thoroughly wherever possible by means of good professional practice;
Whereas vegetables have an essential nutritional function and play an important role in health protection; whereas the consumption of vegetables should therefore be encouraged by improving the quality of the products on offer;
Whereas some Member States have adopted, or are planning to adopt, maximum levels for nitrates in certain vegetables;
Whereas, in view of the disparities between Member States and the consequent risk of distortion of competition, Community measures are necessary in order to ensure market unity while abiding by the principle of proportionality;
Whereas specific measures designed to provide better control of the sources of agricultural contamination together with codes of good practice may help to reduce the contaminant levels of certain vegetables and in particular the nitrate levels;
Whereas climatic conditions, production methods and eating habits vary widely in different parts of the Community; whereas different maximum nitrate levels should therefore be fixed for vegetables depending on the season; whereas, moreover, Member States should be allowed for a transitional period to authorize the marketing of lettuces and spinach grown and intended for consumption in their territory with nitrate levels higher than those fixed in point 1.1 of Part I of the Annex, provided, however, that the quantities present remain acceptable from the point of view of public health;
Whereas lettuce and spinach producers established in the Member States which have given the abovementioned authorizations should progressively modify their farming methods by applying the good practice recommended at national level so as to comply at the end of the transitional period with the maximum levels laid down at Community level;
Whereas it is desirable to achieve common values as soon as possible;
Whereas a study should be made, based on the available scientific data, as to whether maximum contaminant levels should be set for baby food for infants and young children;
Whereas the free movement throughout the Community of foodstuffs with contaminant levels below or equal to those fixed in the Annex should be guaranteed;
Whereas the Member States must adopt appropriate surveillance measures regarding the presence of contaminants in foodstuffs;
Whereas any maximum level adopted at Community level will have to be revised to take account of the advance of scientific and technical knowledge and improvements in production practice;
Whereas the levels set for lettuce and spinach should be reviewed and, if necessary, reduced before 1 October 1998; whereas the review will be based on the results of controls carried out by the Member States;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the application made by the notification on 1 June 1982 by the jewellery manufacturer, Murat SA, Viry-Chatillon, France, for negative clearance or, failing that, exemption of a proposed standard form agreement with the retailers of its products in a number of Community countries,
Having regard to the summary of the application published (2) in accordance with Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
Having heard the opinion of the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
WHEREAS:
I. THE FACTS
A. The undertaking
(1) Murat is a public limited company with a registered office at Viry-Chatillon, France, whose shares are mainly held by non-corporate investors. Its main business is the manufacture of gold, silver and gold-plated jewellery, the latter chiefly rolled gold with a high gold content which is applied by a process used by Murat since 1847. The company, which owns three factories in France employing about 450, is one of the biggest employers in the French jewellery industry, which despite a tendency towards concentration is still quite widely dispersed. In a secondary capacity Murat also distributes under its brand name jewellery and watches made by others.
(2) Murat sells the biggest part of its products on the French market, which accounts for about 90 % of its annual turnover. Its share of that market varies according to the type of product concerned: 4 % for gold, 14 to 15 % for silver, 30 % for gold-plated (making it the market leader in this class) and 60 % for the rolled gold category of gold-plated. Within the EEC Murat exports mainly to Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg, but its market share in these countries is quite small. In a small way it has also quite recently entered the United Kingdom, Irish and Dutch markets, and occasionally sells to Italy and Greece as well. Its exports to non-EEC countries - Switzerland and latterly also Austria, Spain and countries outside Europe - are fairly insignificant.
(3) To promote sales of its brand both inside and outside the common market, Murat has built up a distribution system which operates as follows: the method of supplying retailers varies depending on the country. In France and Germany retailers are supplied by Murat representatives direct.
In the Belgium-Luxembourg area its products are marketed to the retailers by an exclusive distributor bound to Murat by an exclusive distribution agreement, which was notified in 1963 and fulfils the conditions of the block
exemption granted for such agreements by Commission Regulations No 67/67/EEC (1) and (EEC) No 1983/83 (2). Since less than two years there have also been exclusive distributors for the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Netherlands and the non-EEC countries Austria and Spain.
For the other continents Murat has two sales representatives who make annual sales tours to various countries.
(4) The retailing of Murat products is handled by a network of around 7 000 retailers in France, 1 000 in Germany and 650 in Belgium and Luxembourg, and Murat is also planning to expand its network in the countries in which it has entered the market.
B. The notified agreement
(5) The notified draft agreement is intended to serve as the standard form agreement governing relations between Murat and its retailers in all the countries in which it does business. It embodies the requirements currently applied by Murat in authorizing retailers to sell its products.
(6) The requirements are as follows. The dealer must:
- carry on a business as a retail jeweller/watchmaker either from a shop or from a self-contained specialist department,
- possess the necessary professional knowledge, evidence by either the certificate of a jewellery or watchmaking college or by at least four years' experience in the trade in either sales or repair work,
- have premises used exclusively for trade in jewellery, clocks and watches, gold and silver plate, table ornaments and luxury gift articles.
(7) Murat retailers further undertake:
- to order such quantities as both to cover their own requirements and match the quantities usually delivered by Murat, the minimum stocks taken on such occasions to represent at least three months' sales of Murat brand products. This minimum order size is much lower than that customary in the trade. Retailers generally order two or three times a year, i.e. four to six months' supplies at a time,
- to keep stock under good conditions and to display the product to advantage,
- not to mix Murat products with others of similar appearance but different quality,
- to use the promotional aids and advertising material supplied by Murat for displaying Murat products in their shops,
- when asked to repair Murat brand jewellery, either to carry out such repair work themselves or have it done by others whose workmanship they can control or, where the work is such that there is a danger of damaging the article, to return the products to Murat's after-sales service department.
(8) Murat undertakes in return:
- to do its best to fulfil either direct or through its exclusive distributors orders placed by authorized retailers,
- to supply or permit to be supplied only retailers who meet the requirements of the agreement,
- to place its full technical, commercial and promotional expertise at dealers' disposal to help them boost their sales,
- to mount nation-wide advertising campaigns and allow retailers to use this advertising at local level with posters, shields, display stands and small catalogues,
- to honour its warranty and devote the utmost care to any product of its manufacture returned for repair or alteration.
(9) The notified standard form agreement contains no provisions on price fixing. Retailers are free to set their own prices. Some of the annual catalogues which Murat publishes for jewellery retailers to distribute contain recommended prices. Such prices are not in any way binding and quite large differences can in fact be found in the prices charged even by retailers quite close together.
The agreement has a one-year term, which is renewable by tacit agreement. It may be terminated for breaches of the retailer's obligations.
(10) The notified standard form agreement originally contained a clause which Murat has since amended in response to observations made by the Commission. The clause forbade authorized retailers to 'sell Murat products outside the usual distribution channels to unauthorized dealers'. Murat have now limited the prohibition to the sale of Murat products 'outside the usual distribution channels to any dealer not meeting the general requirements covered in the criteria of professional competence', i.e. criteria set out in paragraph 6.
(11) The Commission has received no observations from third parties following publication of the notice required by Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
(12) The notified standard form agreement governing the relations between Murat and its retailers embodies the terms of the selective distribution system set up by Murat at the retail level and is an agreement between undertakings within the meaning of Article 85 of the Treaty.
(13) As has been established in cases before the Court of Justice, agreements concerned with selective distribution systems are not caught by Article 85 (1) of the Treaty when the dealers in question are selected on objective, qualitative criteria related to the capacity of the dealer, his staff and premises and bearing in mind the genuine requirements of distribution of the products, and provided that such criteria are laid down in a uniform manner for all prospective dealers and applied in a non-discriminatory fashion.
(14) In the present case, the requirements Murat has laid down for admission to the authorized retailer network are purely of a general, technical and professional nature. The requirements, concerning the retailer's standard of professional training and technical knowledge and the intended purpose and appearance of his premises (see paragraph 6 above) are such as, in general, to exclude from the distribution system only traders who would be unable to sell articles of jewellery under conditions that were satisfactory for the consumers or who would be unable to supply services ancillary to distribution. Satisfactory conditions for the sale of high-quality gold, silver and high-gold-content gold-plated jewellery are afforded only by specialist shops which have trained staff and adequate storage and display facilities. Retailers must also be capable of undertaking warranty obligations and providing after-sales service, either themselves or through third parties.
These requirements are laid down uniformly for all potential retailers. Furthermore, retailers meeting the requirements are not subject to approval in all cases by Murat before being supplied with its products (see paragraph 10 above) so that the system does not lend itself to a discriminatory application.
(15) Nor are the other obligations imposed on retailers caught by Article 85 (1) of the Treaty. The obligation to use the promotional aids supplied by Murat for displaying its products and not to mix Murat products with others of similar appearance but different quality do not restrict competition, but seek to enhance the presentation and brand image of Murat products and avoid confusion with other brands. They do not prevent Murat retailers from selling competing products. The obligation, to take at least three months' supplies each time the authorized retailer orders, is not in this case significantly restrictive from a competition point of view since this quantity is less than that customary in the trade (see first indent of paragraph 7 above).
(16) The obligations undertaken by Murat, in particular to supply or permit to be supplied only retailers who meet the specified requirements, represent a normal consideration for the commitments accepted by retailers and are in accordance with the Community competition rules.
(17) Since the notified standard form agreement does not contain any obligation having as its object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market or liable to affect trade between the Member States, there are no grounds, on the basis of the facts in the Commission's possession, for action on its part under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty. The Commission can therefore give the agreement negative clearance under Article 2 of Regulation No 17,","{'title': '83/610/EEC: Commission Decision of 5 December 1983 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/30.668 - Murat) (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Commission hereby finds that, on the basis of the facts in its possession, there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty for action on its part in respect of the standard form distribution agreement between Murat and its retailers.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to Murat SA, Viry-Chatillon, France.\n\nDone at Brussels, 5 December 1983.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz ANDRIESSEN\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No 13, 21. 2. 1962, p. 204/62.\n\n(2) OJ No C 155, 14. 6. 1983, p. 2.\n\n(1) OJ No 57, 25. 3. 1967, p. 849/67.\n\n(2) OJ No L 173, 30. 6. 1983, p. 1.'}]}"

Whereas the information which purchasers need to be able to forward collection information before 15 May is already in their possession in April;
Whereas non-observance of the time limit of 14 May by purchasers is likely to hamper the competent authorities in their task of completing the calculation work necessary to determine quota overruns and sums due; whereas the more a purchaser delays communication of the information, the more serious are the consequences for the competent authorities which have to ensure payment of the levy before the time limit;
Whereas experience shows that to make the penalty more effective and to ensure that the size of the penalty is in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, the penalty applicable where the delay exceeds 15 days should be increased and provision should be made for increasing penalties for additional delays;

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 131 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 contains, amongst others, the restrictions previously laid down in Council Directive 76/769/EEC (2).
(2) Directive 2005/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) prohibited the placing on the market and use of extender oils for the production of tyres or parts of tyres if they contain more than 1 mg/kg of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), or more than 10 mg/kg of the sum of the eight listed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). That restriction is currently laid down in paragraph 1 of column 2 of entry 50 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
(3) At the time of adoption of that restriction, there were no harmonised test methods available to determine the specific concentration of the eight listed PAHs in extender oils. Therefore, the analytical method IP 346:1998 (4), used by the petroleum industry to determine the concentration of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PCA), is referred to in that restriction as an indirect method to determine compliance with the limits specified for BaP and the sum of all listed PAHs.
(4) The analytical method IP 346:1998 is not specific to the eight listed PAHs. Furthermore, it is well established that this method is limited in its scope to unused lubricating base oils, free of asphaltene fractions and having not more than 5 % of their components with a boiling point below 300 °C. For samples not meeting those requirements, that method may be unsuitable.
(5) As called for in Directive 2005/69/EC, on 3 July 2007 the Commission issued a mandate to the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) for the development of a more specific method.
(6) The new standard method has been adopted and published by CEN as EN 16143:2013 (Petroleum products — Determination of content of Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) and selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in extender oils — Procedure using double LC cleaning and GC/MS analysis).
(7) The Commission considers that, given that this new standard provides a specific analytical method to analyse the relevant PAHs in extender oils and overcomes the shortcomings of the previous method, it is appropriate to replace the citation of method IP 346:1998 by the new standard EN 16143:2013 as the reference method to determine compliance of extender oils with the restriction in paragraph 1 of column 2 of entry 50 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
(8) An informal consultation carried out with Member States and representatives of relevant stakeholder associations indicated that, for extender oils, there is in general a good correlation between the results of method IP 346:1998 and gas-chromatographic analytical methods, which follow the same principle as the new CEN method, to measure individual carcinogenic PAHs. Economic operators have indicated that the replacement of IP 346:1998 by the new CEN method is not expected to have impacts on the compliance of extender oils. However, the new analytical method is reported to be more complex and costly to perform than IP 346:1998.
(9) A transitional period of eighteen months should be granted whereby both the old and the new analytical methods could be used alternatively for determining compliance with that restriction. This transitional period should allow laboratories to set up and obtain the necessary experience in the operation of the new analytical method. It should also facilitate determining compliance of extender oils placed on the market already before the entry into force of this Regulation.
(10) The Commission has completed its re-evaluation of the measures of entry 51 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 regarding the substances bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), in accordance with paragraph 3 of that entry. This re-evaluation was launched on 4 September 2009 by the Commission's request to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to review the available new scientific information and to evaluate whether there is evidence that would justify a re-examination of the existing restriction. In providing the information to the Commission in March 2010, ECHA pointed out that an assessment of the relevant REACH registration dossiers should be considered. Therefore, the Commission asked ECHA to proceed as suggested. However, in April 2011, the Kingdom of Denmark initiated the restrictions process regarding the presence of those phthalates in articles for indoor use and articles that may come into direct contact with the skin or mucous membranes, in which, amongst other things, the registration dossiers were considered. As communicated on 9 August 2014 (5), at the end of the restriction process, the Commission did not propose an amendment to Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Furthermore, by means of Commission Regulation (EU) No 143/2011 (6), the Commission included those phthalates in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Consequently, pursuant to Article 69(2) of that Regulation, ECHA has the obligation to consider after the ‘sunset date’ whether the use of those phthalates in articles poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not adequately controlled. Therefore, no further review of the measures for this restriction of those phthalates was considered necessary and it is therefore appropriate to delete that paragraph from that entry.
(11) In January 2014, the Commission completed its re-evaluation of the measures of entry 52 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 regarding the substances di-‘isononyl’ phthalate (DINP), di-‘isodecyl’ phthalate (DIDP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), in accordance with paragraph 3 of that entry. This re-evaluation was launched on 4 September 2009 by the Commission's request to ECHA to review the available new scientific information and to evaluate whether there is evidence that would justify a re-examination of the existing restriction. The available information was subsequently complemented by the information from the registration dossiers received by the 2010 registration deadline. ECHA then submitted its draft review report to its Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) for a detailed evaluation. RAC adopted its opinion in March 2013 and the final ECHA review report was provided to the Commission in August 2013. Based on the ECHA report the Commission decided not to propose any amendment to the provisions of entry 52 of Annex XVII, and to consider the re-evaluation in accordance with paragraph 3 of that entry as completed. The Commission's conclusions on the re-evaluation have been made publicly available (7). It is therefore appropriate to delete paragraph 3 from that entry.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,","{'header': '3.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 58/43', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) 2015/326\nof 2 March 2015\namending Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and phthalates\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 contains, amongst others, the restrictions previously laid down in Council Directive 76/769/EEC(2).\n\n((2)) Directive 2005/69/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)prohibited the placing on the market and use of extender oils for the production of tyres or parts of tyres if they contain more than 1 mg/kg of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), or more than 10 mg/kg of the sum of the eight listed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

COUNCIL DECISION
of 19 January 2010
establishing whether effective action has been taken by Greece in response to the Council Recommendation of 27 April 2009
(2010/291/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(8) in conjunction with Article 126(13) and Article 136 thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. The Stability and Growth Pact includes Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1), which was adopted in order to further the prompt correction of excessive general government deficits.
(3) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the excessive deficit procedure. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(4) The Council, acting upon a recommendation by the Commission, decided on 27 April 2009, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, that an excessive deficit existed in Greece (2).
(5) On 27 April 2009, the Council, also on the basis of a Commission recommendation, adopted a recommendation (3) in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the Greek authorities calling on them to put an end to the excessive deficit situation by 2010 at the latest, by bringing the general government deficit below 3 % of GDP in a credible and sustainable manner. To that end, the Council established the deadline of 27 October 2009 for the Greek government to take effective action.
(6) The progress with improving the collection and processing of statistical data and their reporting, in particular general government data, as requested by the Council, has been deficient. The latest revision of the October 2009 notification has not been validated by Eurostat due to the significant uncertainties over the figures notified by the Greek authorities. The procedures in place to ensure a prompt and correct supply of general government data required by the existing legal framework are manifestly inadequate.
(7) The assessment of the action taken by Greece to correct the excessive deficit by 2010 in response to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Community leads to the following conclusions:
— subsequent to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) in April 2009, the Greek authorities implemented the deficit-reducing measures included in the 2009 budget law, the January 2009 update of the stability programme and the March 2009 additional package of fiscal measures. However, although the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions has been more pronounced than anticipated by the authorities, public finances have worsened much beyond what could have been expected as a result of the stronger-than-projected downturn and to a large extent as a result of budgetary policies implemented by the Greek government. Notably, on the expenditure side, the 2009 budget execution points to sizeable expenditure overruns in 2009 of which more than half is attributed to higher-than-budgeted outlays for compensation of employees and increased capital spending. On the revenue side, the 2009 budget execution points to important shortcomings in the tax collection system, including tax compliance,
— on 25 June 2009, the Greek authorities announced additional deficit-reducing discretionary measures, with an estimated budgetary impact of some 1,25 % percentage points of GDP. However, the majority of the measures have not been implemented by the Greek authorities so far and almost one percentage point of GDP was temporary in nature (one-offs), targeting additional revenue, hence not in line with the Council recommendations to strengthen fiscal adjustment in 2009 through permanent measures, mainly on the expenditure side,
— moreover, the fiscal consolidation measures implemented in 2009 are not sufficient to achieve the general government deficit target of 3,7 % of GDP in 2009. They also do not address the challenges stemming from the external imbalances and the deteriorating competitiveness position of the Greek economy as recommended by the Council,
— the large projected increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the impact of the deterioration in the general government’s net borrowing position, indicating insufficient efforts to control factors other than net borrowing, which contribute to the change in debt levels.
(8) This leads to the conclusion that significant revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns have led to a strong deterioration in Greece’s budgetary position in 2009, which can only partly be attributed to the deterioration of the macroeconomic conditions and, hence, are mainly due to an insufficient response by the Greek authorities to the April 2009 Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Community,","{'header': '21.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/50', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 19 January 2010\nestablishing whether effective action has been taken by Greece in response to the Council Recommendation of 27 April 2009\n(2010/291/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. The Stability and Growth Pact includes Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1), which was adopted in order to further the prompt correction of excessive general government deficits.\n\n((3)) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the excessive deficit procedure. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.\n\n((4)) The Council, acting upon a recommendation by the Commission, decided on 27 April 2009, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, that an excessive deficit existed in Greece(2).\n\n((5)) On 27 April 2009, the Council, also on the basis of a Commission recommendation, adopted a recommendation(3)in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Community to the Greek authorities calling on them to put an end to the excessive deficit situation by 2010 at the latest, by bringing the general government deficit below 3\xa0% of GDP in a credible and sustainable manner. To that end, the Council established the deadline of 27 October 2009 for the Greek government to take effective action.\n\n((6)) The progress with improving the collection and processing of statistical data and their reporting, in particular general government data, as requested by the Council, has been deficient. The latest revision of the October 2009 notification has not been validated by Eurostat due to the significant uncertainties over the figures notified by the Greek authorities. The procedures in place to ensure a prompt and correct supply of general government data required by the existing legal framework are manifestly inadequate.\n\n((7)) The assessment of the action taken by Greece to correct the excessive deficit by 2010 in response to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) of the Treaty establishing the European Community leads to the following conclusions:—subsequent to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) in April 2009, the Greek authorities implemented the deficit-reducing measures included in the 2009 budget law, the January 2009 update of the stability programme and the March 2009 additional package of fiscal measures. However, although the deterioration in macroeconomic conditions has been more pronounced than anticipated by the authorities, public finances have worsened much beyond what could have been expected as a result of the stronger-than-projected downturn and to a large extent as a result of budgetary policies implemented by the Greek government. Notably, on the expenditure side, the 2009 budget execution points to sizeable expenditure overruns in 2009 of which more than half is attributed to higher-than-budgeted outlays for compensation of employees and increased capital spending. On the revenue side, the 2009 budget execution points to important shortcomings in the tax collection system, including tax compliance,—on 25 June 2009, the Greek authorities announced additional deficit-reducing discretionary measures, with an estimated budgetary impact of some 1,25\xa0% percentage points of GDP. However, the majority of the measures have not been implemented by the Greek authorities so far and almost one percentage point of GDP was temporary in nature (one-offs), targeting additional revenue, hence not in line with the Council recommendations to strengthen fiscal adjustment in 2009 through permanent measures, mainly on the expenditure side,—moreover, the fiscal consolidation measures implemented in 2009 are not sufficient to achieve the general government deficit target of 3,7\xa0% of GDP in 2009. They also do not address the challenges stemming from the external imbalances and the deteriorating competitiveness position of the Greek economy as recommended by the Council,—the large projected increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the impact of the deterioration in the general government’s net borrowing position, indicating insufficient efforts to control factors other than net borrowing, which contribute to the change in debt levels.\n\n(—) subsequent to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) in April 2009, the Greek authorities implemented the deficit-reducing measures included in the 2009 budget law, the January 2009 update of the stability programme and the March 2009 additional package of fiscal measures.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

Whereas achieving freedom to provide services in the field of transport is an important element of the common transport policy under the Treaty and whereas, consequently, it is the aim of that policy to increase the fluidity of movement of the different  means of transport within the Community;
Whereas the Community is engaged in the adoption of measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992, which comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of  goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty;
Whereas pursuant to the Commission's White Paper the Commission is to present a proposal to the Council in order to abolish frontier checks and formalities related to the means of inland transport and documentation;
Whereas, pursuant to existing Community and national legislation in the field of road and inland waterway transport, Member States perform checks, verifications
and inspections relating to technical characteristics, authorizations and other documentation that vehicles and inland waterway vessels must comply with; whereas these checks, verifications and inspections continue in general to be justified in order to  avoid disturbances to the organization of the transport market and to ensure road and inland waterway safety;
Whereas, under existing Community legislation, Member States are free to organize and perform the aforementioned checks, verifications and inspections where they so wish but in practice they normally carry them out at their frontiers;
Whereas such controls, verifications and inspections may be performed with equal efficacy throughout the territory of the Member States concerned and crossing the frontier should not therefore be a pretext for carrying out such operations,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4060/89 of 21 December 1989 on the elimination of controls performed at the frontiers of Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation applies to controls performed by Member States pursuant to Community or national law in the fields of road and inland waterway transport carried out using means of transport registered or put into circulation in a Member State.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n\n(a)  'frontier' means either an internal frontier within the Community or an external frontier, where carriage between Member States involves crossing a third country;\n\n(b)\n\n'control' means any check, inspection, verification or formality performed at the frontiers of Member States by the national authorities, which signifies a stop or a restriction on the free movement of the vehicles or vessels concerned.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nControls, referred to in the Annex, performed pursuant to Community or national law in the fields of road and inland waterway transport between Member States shall no longer be performed as frontier-control but solely as part of the normal  control procedures applied in a non-discriminatory fashion throughout the territory of a Member State.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 1990.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 21 December 1989.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nE.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (1), and in particular points (a), (c) and (d) of Article 187 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) provides for preferential arrangements for 2014 as regards customs duties for the import of certain goods originating in Ukraine. In accordance with Article 3 of that Regulation agricultural products listed in Annex III thereto are to be admitted for import into the Union within the limits of the tariff quotas as set out in that Annex. The quotas referred to in Annex III to that Regulation are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with Article 184(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
(2) While the quota concerned should normally be managed through the use of import licences, it is however appropriate to attribute import rights as a first step and to issue import licences as a second, as provided for in Article 6(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 (3). In this way, operators that have obtained import rights should be able to decide, during the course of the quota period, the moment when they wish to apply for import licences, in view of their actual trade flows.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 (4) should apply to import licences issued under this Regulation, save where derogations are appropriate.
(4) Furthermore, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 which concern applications for import rights, the status of applicants and the issue of import licences, should apply to import licences issued pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in this Regulation.
(5) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, a security should be lodged at the time of submission of an import rights application and at the time of issue of an import licence.
(6) In order to oblige operators to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be provided that such obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2012 (5).
(7) Since the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are open only until 31 October 2014, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2007/777/EC (2) lays down animal and public health rules for imports into the Union and the transit and storage in the Union of consignments of certain meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines (‘the commodities’).
(2) Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC sets out a list of third countries or parts thereof from which the introduction of the commodities into the Union is authorised, provided that they have undergone the relevant treatments as set out in Part 4 of that Annex. The relevant treatments are to eliminate certain animal health risk linked to the specific commodities and the animal health situation in the third country or parts thereof. Part 4 set outs a non-specific treatment ‘A’ and specific treatments ‘B’ to ‘F’ listed in descending order of severity of the animal health risk linked to the commodity.
(3) Japan is not listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC as a third country from which the introduction into the Union of the commodities is authorised. However, Japan has requested that it be added to that list for the commodities obtained from domestic bovine and porcine animals, farmed cloven-hoofed game, poultry and farmed feathered game (except ratites).
(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (3) lays down veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of fresh meat. In accordance with that Regulation, consignments of fresh meat intended for human consumption may only be imported into the Union if they come from third countries, territories or parts thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Regulation and if they comply with the relevant requirements laid down in Union legislation.
(5) Japan is listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 in respect of consignments of fresh bovine meat and therefore is recognised in Union legislation as providing sufficient animal health guarantees for those consignments. Accordingly, consignments from that third country of the commodities obtained from bovine animals, as referred to in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC, should be authorised for introduction into the Union subject to the non-specific treatment ‘A’, as set out in Part 4 of that Annex.
(6) In 2014 Japan notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of subtype H5 in holdings on its territory. Japan has imposed a stamping-out policy to control that disease and to limit its spread. Furthermore, cases of HPAI of the subtype H5 have been confirmed in wild birds on its territory on several occasions. Accordingly, consignments from that third country of the commodities obtained from poultry, as referred to in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC, should be authorised for introduction into the Union subject to the specific treatment ‘D’, as set out in Part 4 of that Annex.
(7) Japan notifies the OIE of outbreaks of diseases in porcine animals and the disease situation is favourable in that third country, as regards diseases to which porcine animals are susceptible and for which guarantees are to be certified in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 206/2010. Accordingly, consignments from that third country of the commodities obtained from porcine animals, as referred to in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC, should be authorised for introduction into the Union provided that they have undergone the specific treatment ‘B’, as set out in Part 4 of that Annex.
(8) Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC should therefore be amended in order to authorise the introduction into the Union from Japan of the commodities obtained from domestic bovine and porcine animals, farmed cloven-hoofed game, poultry and farmed feathered game (except ratites).

of 28 January 2004
opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of wheat held by the German intervention agency
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1998 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(2) provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) Germany still has intervention stocks of wheat.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of wheat held by the German intervention agency available on the internal market.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender.

(2) Germany still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereal production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.

(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.

Whereas:
(1) Article 17(e) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides for the granting of private storage aid for butter.
(2) On 7 August 2014, the Russian government introduced a ban on imports of certain products from the Union to Russia, including dairy products. Developments in prices and stocks of butter indicate a particular difficult market situation which may be eliminated or reduced by storage. In view of the current market situation, it is appropriate to grant aid for private storage for butter and to fix the amount of aid in advance.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 (4) has established common rules for the implementation of a private storage aid scheme.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in Chapter III of that Regulation.
(5) In accordance with Article 16(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 and in order to ensure placing of homogeneous and manageable lots in storage it is appropriate to specify the requirements for a ‘storage lot’.
(6) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification and since the required information concerning storage details is already included in the application for aid, it is appropriate to waive the request to supply the same information after the conclusion of the contract as provided for in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.
(7) For reasons of simplification and logistic efficiency, Member States should be allowed to waive the requirement to mark the contract number on each unit stored where the contracts number is entered in the stores register.
(8) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, taking into account the particular situation for butter storage, the checks provided for in Article 36(6) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be carried out in respect of at least one half of the contracts. Consequently, a derogation from that Article should be provided for.
(9) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013, the aid for private storage fixed in advance should be based on storage costs and/or other relevant market elements. It is appropriate to set an aid for fixed storage costs for entry and exit of the products concerned and an aid per day of storage for costs for cold storage and financing.
(10) In accordance with Article 35(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 and in order to closely follow the use of the measure it is appropriate to specify the deadline for submitting the notifications provided for in Article 35(1)(a) of that Regulation.
(11) In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, the temporary measure provided for in this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.

In view of the current market situation, it is appropriate to grant aid for private storage for butter and to fix the amount of aid in advance.\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008(4)has established common rules for the implementation of a private storage aid scheme.\n\n((4)) Pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, aid fixed in advance is to be granted in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in Chapter III of that Regulation.\n\n((5)) In accordance with Article 16(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 and in order to ensure placing of homogeneous and manageable lots in storage it is appropriate to specify the requirements for a ‘storage lot’.\n\n((6)) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification and since the required information concerning storage details is already included in the application for aid, it is appropriate to waive the request to supply the same information after the conclusion of the contract as provided for in point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.\n\n((7)) For reasons of simplification and logistic efficiency, Member States should be allowed to waive the requirement to mark the contract number on each unit stored where the contracts number is entered in the stores register.\n\n((8)) For reasons of administrative efficiency and simplification, taking into account the particular situation for butter storage, the checks provided for in Article 36(6) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 should be carried out in respect of at least one half of the contracts. Consequently, a derogation from that Article should be provided for.\n\n((9)) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013, the aid for private storage fixed in advance should be based on storage costs and/or other relevant market elements. It is appropriate to set an aid for fixed storage costs for entry and exit of the products concerned and an aid per day of storage for costs for cold storage and financing.\n\n((10)) In accordance with Article 35(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 and in order to closely follow the use of the measure it is appropriate to specify the deadline for submitting the notifications provided for in Article 35(1)(a) of that Regulation.\n\n((11)) In order to have an immediate impact on the market and to contribute to stabilise prices, the temporary measure provided for in this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Regulation provides for private storage aid for butter as referred to in Article 17(e) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01308/2013.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall apply save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe unit of measurement referred to in Article 16(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 is the ‘storage lot’ which corresponds to the quantity of the product covered by this Regulation, weighing at least 1 tonne and of homogeneous composition and quality, produced in a single factory, taken into storage in a single warehouse on a single day.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Point (a) of the first paragraph of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 shall not apply.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States may waive the requirements referred to in Article 22(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 to mark the contract number provided that the store manager undertakes to enter the contract number in the register referred to in point III of Annex I to that Regulation.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from Article 36(6) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, at the end of the contractual storage period, the authority responsible for checking shall, in respect of at least one half of the number of contracts, by sampling, verify weight and identification of the butter in storage.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The aid for the products referred in Article 1 shall be:\n—\n18,93 EUR per tonne of storage for fixed storage costs,\n—\n0,28 EUR per tonne per day of contractual storage.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Contractual storage shall end on the day preceding that of the removal from storage.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Aid may be granted only where the contractual storage period is between 90 and 210 days.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\nApplications for private storage aid for may be lodged as from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.
