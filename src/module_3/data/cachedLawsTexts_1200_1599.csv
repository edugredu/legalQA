Whereas precise definitions are required in order to carry out the surveys provided for in Directive 93/24/EEC; whereas this requires the definition of the agricultural holdings covered by the survey; whereas the individual categories into which the  survey results are to be broken down must be precisely defined, and the herd size classes and regions according to which the Member States draw up the survey results at regular intervals must be determined; whereas a single definition of carcass weight  is necessary for the drawing-up of slaughtering statistics;
Whereas, with the amendment of the combined nomenclature for live bovine animals by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2505/92 (2), it is no longer possible, either for intra-Community trade or for trade with non-member countries, for the Member States to  record trade in bulls and bullocks separately; wheres the breakdown of gross indigenous production into bulls and bullocks required under Council Directive 93/24/EEC is thus no longer possible; whereas Directive 93/24/EEC should therefore be amended;
Whereas, furthermore, according to Directive 93/24/EEC, the Member States may, at their request, be authorized to carry out the May or June surveys in selected regions, on the understanding that these surveys cover at least 70 % of the bovine  population; whereas Member States whose bovine population makes up only a small percentage of the overall population of the Community may, at their request, also be authorized to dispense altogether with either the May/June or December surveys, or to  use the regional breakdown for the final results of the May/June survey; whereas, finally, the Member States may, at their request, be authorized to use administrative sources instead of statistical surveys to determine the cattle population and the  prescribed breakdown by herd size classes for the final results of even-numbered years and/or for the results of the May/June survey;

","23.5.2013 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 136/15
COMMISSION DECISION
of 22 May 2013
terminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China
(2013/227/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Initiation
(1) In April 2012 the European Commission (‘the Commission’) announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2) (‘the Notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding with regard to imports into the Union of bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the anti-subsidy proceeding’).
(2) The anti-subsidy proceeding was initiated following a complaint lodged on 15 March 2012 by EBMA, the European Bicycles Manufacturers Association (‘the complainant’), on behalf of Union producers representing more than 25 % of the total Union production of bicycles.
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of subsidisation of the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
(4) The Commission officially advised the complainant, other known Union producers, Union producers associations, the known exporting producers in the People’s Republic of China (‘the PRC’) and associations of exporting producers, the representatives of the PRC, known importers and associations of importers, known Union producers of bicycle parts and their associations and known users of the initiation of the proceeding and sent questionnaires. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the Notice of initiation.
2.   Parallel anti-dumping proceeding
(5) In March 2012 the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3) the initiation of an interim review of the anti-dumping measures concerning imports into the Union of bicycles originating in the PRC pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 13(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (4) (‘the basic anti-dumping Regulation’). The investigation is ongoing.
3.   Parallel anti-circumvention investigation
(6) In September 2012 by Commission Regulation (EU) No 875/2012 (5), the Commission initiated an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011 (6) on imports of bicycles originating in the PRC by imports of bicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, and making such imports subject to registration (‘the anti-circumvention investigation’).
(7) In November 2012 the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (7) that the findings in the anti-circumvention investigation may be used in the anti-subsidy proceeding.
(8) The anti-circumvention investigation is still ongoing.
B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(9) By letter of 22 March 2013 addressed to the Commission, the complainant formally withdrew its complaint.
(10) In accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(11) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the respective anti-subsidy investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given an opportunity to comment. However, no comments were received that would give a reason to reach a different conclusion.
(12) It was therefore concluded that the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of bicycles originating in the PRC should be terminated without the imposition of measures,","{'header': '23.5.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 136/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 May 2013\nterminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China\n(2013/227/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of bicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles but excluding unicycles), not motorised, originating in the People’s Republic of China and currently falling within CN codes 8712\xa000\xa030  and ex\xa08712\xa000\xa070  is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 18 July 1984
on an aid proposal by the Irish Government in favour of a producer of polyester yarn situated in Letterkenny
(Only the English text is authentic)
(84/498/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments as provided for in the said Article 93, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By letter dated 22 December 1983, the Irish Government notified the Commission of its intention to grant aid to a company which has taken over the polyester yarn production plant situated in Letterkenny from its former owner. The aid would take the form of grant assistance amounting to £ Irl 2 900 000 and would be granted by the Industrial Development Authority (IDA).
By telex dated 12 January 1984, the Commission requested additional information from the Irish Government. This information was received on 19 and 30 January 1984.
Having examined the aid proposal, the Commission considered that the aid would affect trade between Member States to an extent contrary to the common interest and that it would, therefore, be incompatible with the common market, particularly in a situation where other EC producers of synthetic fibres by considerably reducing capacities undertake great efforts to adapt to the present market situation, which is marked by serious difficulties of overcapacities. The Commission also considered that the aid would not help to restructure the polyester plant in the sense of the Commission's synthetic fibre discipline of 1977 and prolonged in 1979, 1981 and 1983 as the assistance would neither lead at any decrease in capacities nor help to convert the production facility away from synthetic fibres. Consequently, the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty and, by letter of 8 March 1984, gave the Irish Government notice to submit its comments.
II
The Irish Government, in submitting its comments under the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty by letter of 6 April and telex of 27 June 1984, pointed out that the aid of £ Irl 2 900 000 would be provided for investment of £ Irl 5 million in order to upgrade product quality and plant control. No grant or other State assistance would be provided for the balance of the total investment of £ Irl 16 700 000, which covers also the acquisition cost of the Letterkenny plant.
The Irish Government argued that the proposed aid conforms with Article 92 (3) (a) of the EEC Treaty in promoting County Donegal and that it would not lead to an increase in production capacity and would, therefore, be in line with the synthetic fibre discipline.
The Irish Government, in addition, has informed the Commission that the company in question was unable to give any formal written commitment not to increase existing polyester yarn production capacity at its Letterkenny plant, even for a limited period of time.
The comments of two other Member States, one federation of firms in the sector and three individual companies, submitted to the Commission under the Article 93 (2) procedure, supported the Commission's view and highlighted the difficult situation of producers of polyester yarn because of overcapacity problems. They also underlined the need to fully respect the synthetic fibre discipline, particularly in a situation where market prospects are dim. It also was claimed that the aid in question gave an unfair advantage to the yarn producer concerned in competition with other Community manufacturers.
III
In polyester yarn there is a high volume of trade and a large degree of competition between Member States. Consequently, the Irish Government's proposed aid is likely to affect trade and distort competition between Member States by favouring the undertaking in question within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty. Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty lays down the principle that aid having the features there described is incompatible with the common market. The exceptions from this principle set out in Article 92 (3) specify objectives in the Community interest transcending the interests of the aid recipient. These exceptions must be construed narrowly when any regional or industry aid scheme or any individual award under a general aid scheme is scrutinized. In particular, they may be applied only when the Commission is satisfied that the free play of market forces alone, without the aid, would not induce the prospective aid recipient to adopt a course of action contributing to attainment of one of the said objectives.
To apply the exceptions to cases not contributing to such an objective would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.
In applying these principles in its scrutiny of individual aid awards, the Commission must satisfy itself that the aid is justified by the contribution the recipient is making to attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3), and is necessary to that end. Where this cannot be demonstrated, and especially where the aided investment would take place in any case, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to attainment of the objectives specified in the exceptions but merely serves to bolster the financial position of the recipient firm.
The recipient in the present case cannot be said to be making such a contribution in return for the aid.
The Irish Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the planned aid falls within one of the categories of exceptions in Article 92 (3).
There is substantial overcapacity in polyester yarn in the EEC, the market for this product has constantly been reduced since 1978 and there are no signs that this trend will change. In 1983, like in the years before, capacity utilization is estimated to have been considerably below 70 %, which is insufficient for economically viable operation. As a result, there is heavy competition amongst polyester producers in the EC, most of which continue to lose money in polyester production as prices are very depressed. New capacity reductions required and agreed upon over the period up to the end of 1985 are considerable.
Polyester yarn belongs to the group of products which is subject to the industry agreements under which capacities are to be reduced and also is subject to the synthetic fibre discipline introduced by the Commission in 1977 and prolonged in 1979, 1981 and 1983. Both the industry agreements and the Community system of control of aid to the synthetic fibre industry were introduced and extended because of large and uncontested overcapacities in the sector.
In its letter of 8 August 1983 by which it extended the system of control of aids for a further two-year period ending 19 July 1985, the Commission pointed out to Member States that it will express an unfavourable a priori opinion with regard to proposed aids, be they sectoral, regional or general, which have the effect of increasing the net production capacity by companies in this sector. It also reminded Member States that it will continue to give sympathetic consideration to proposals to grant aid for the purpose of speeding up or facilitating the process of conversion away from synthetic fibres into other activities or restructuring leading to reductions in capacity.
All aids to the synthetic fibre sector do not only have to meet the conditions of the synthetic fibre discipline but are also subject to the 1971 and 1977 guidelines of the Commission for aids to the textile industry, under which the granting of aids to investment must be linked to the achievement of restructuring objectives and must be associated with a substantial contribution from the beneficiary towards the cost of the subsidized operation.
The projected investment in the case in question, however, concerns modernization efforts in an out-of-date plant which cannot be characterized as restructuring and which should be carried out by using the proper means of the undertaking concerned without the use of State aid, especially since a very large percentage of the plant's output is exported to the other Member States.
Moreover, the contribution from the potential beneficiary towards the cost of the subsidized operation cannot be called substantial in view of an intensity of the proposed grant assistance of 58 % of total investment.
Furthermore, the Commission has always been opposed in principle to operating aids and has considered that particularly in textiles investment made by an enterprise for the purpose of keeping it in business or maintaining its level of business without affecting any basic change does not qualify for assistance.
Under the projected investment the capacity of the Letterkenny plant remains unchanged at 14 000 tonnes per year, but production output will gradually increase from currently 10 000 tonnes to full capacity, most certainly at the expense of reductions in capacity utilization in other EC firms. As regards the derogation of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) on aid to favour the development of certain areas, it should be remembered that the standard of living in the Letterkenny area is very low and that it suffers from serious underemployment within the meaning of the derogation of paragraph (a). However, the sectoral effects of regional aids need to be controlled even for the most underdeveloped areas, which is why the Commission must exercise its analysis of the economic and social situation in the framework of the Community interest. In the situation the industry concerned is presently in and likely to remain in the future, the investment which is proposed to be grant-aided is not likely to make the production plant financially and economically viable and would not secure the jobs currently provided. Therefore, the proposed aid would not promote the economic development of the Letterkenny area within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c), as it would not bring to the area any lasting increase in income or reduction in unemployment, but would be likely to distort competition in intra-Community trade without making the necessary compensatory contribution to regional development.
As far as the exceptions in Article 92 (3) (b) are concerned, the proposed measure does not have the feature of a 'project of common European interest' or of a project likely 'to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State', whose promotion justifies application of this exception clause. The promotion of one of the objectives of Article 92 (3) (b) is moreover a purpose for which the aid is not intended.
Finally, as regards the derogation of Article 92 (3) (c), in favour of 'aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities', examination of the polyester manufacturing industry in the Community shows that the proposed aid, by artificially lowering the modernization costs of the undertaking in question would weaken the competitive position of other producers in the EC and would therefore have the effect of further reducing capacity utilization and depressing prices, to the detriment of, and possible withdrawal from the market of, producers which have hitherto survived owing to restructuring, productivity and quality improvements undertaken from their own resources. Thus, the proposed aid cannot be considered as 'facilitating the development'. Moreover, it should be noted that the production of the undertaking which is supposed to be aided is mainly exported to other Member States in a situation where demand falls, so that it is therefore unlikely that trading conditions would remain unaffected by a measure contrary to the common interest, such as this aid.
In view of the above, the Irish aid proposal does not meet the conditions necessary to benefit from one of the derogations of Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '84/498/EEC: Commission Decision of 18 July 1984 on an aid proposal by the Irish Government in favour of a producer of polyester yarn situated in Letterkenny (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Irish Government shall refrain from implementing its proposal, communicated to the Commission by letter dated 22 December 1983 from its Permanent Representative to the EC, to grant an aid of £ Irl 2 900 000 in favour of investment to be undertaken by a producer of polyester yarn situated in Letterkenny.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Irish Government shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures taken to comply therewith.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to Ireland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 July 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2248/2001 of 19 November 2001 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia(1), and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Council is in the process of concluding a Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, hereinafter referred to as ""the Stabilisation and Association Agreement"".
(2) Pending the completion of the procedure necessary for the ratification and entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement, the Council is also in the process of concluding an Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part, covering trade and trade-related matters, hereinafter referred to as ""the Interim Agreement"", which will be applied as of 1 January 2002.
(3) The Interim Agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement stipulate that certain fish and fishery products originating in Croatia may be imported into the Community, within the limits of Community tariff quotas, at a reduced or a zero-rate of customs duty.
(4) The tariff quotas provided for in the Interim Agreement and in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement are annual and are repeated for an indeterminate period. The Commission should adopt the implementing measures for the opening and the administration of the Community tariff quotas.
(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 993/2001(3), has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.
(6) Particular care should be taken to ensure that all Community importers have equal and continuous access to the tariff quotas and that the rates laid down for the quotas are applied uninterruptedly to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted. In order to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly. For reasons of speed and efficiency, communication between the Member States and the Commission should, as far as possible, take place by telematic link.
(7) This Regulation should be applied upon the entry into force or the date of provisional application of the Interim Agreement and should remain in application upon the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 7(3) thereof,
After consulting the Fund Committee,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States, accompanied by the information required for clearance and a certificate regarding the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts transmitted and the reports established by the certification bodies, clears the accounts of the paying agencies referred to in Article 4(1) of that Regulation.
(2) Pursuant to Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 of 16 February 1996 on data to be transmitted by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (2), account is taken for the 2004 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2003 and 15 October 2004.
(3) The time limits granted to the Member States for the submission to the Commission of the documents referred to in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) 1258/1999 and in Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 of 7 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section (3), have expired.
(4) The Commission has checked the information submitted and communicated to the Member States before 31 March 2005 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments.
(5) Under the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, the accounts clearance decision referred to in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 must determine, without prejudice to decisions taken subsequently in accordance with Article 7(4) of the Regulation, the amount of expenditure effected in each Member State during the financial year in question recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, on the basis of the accounts referred to in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and the reductions and suspensions of advances for the financial year concerned, including the reductions referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96. Under Article 154 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (4), the outcome of the clearance decision, that is to say any discrepancy which may occur between the total expenditure booked to the accounts for a financial year pursuant to Article 151(1) and Article 152 and the total expenditure taken into consideration by the Commission in this Decision, is to be booked, under a single article, as additional expenditure or a reduction in expenditure.
(6) For certain paying agencies, in the light of the verifications made, the annual accounts and the accompanying documents permit the Commission to take a decision on the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted. Annex I lists the amounts cleared by Member State. The details of these amounts were described in the Summary Report that was presented to the Fund Committee at the same time as this Decision.
(7) In the light of the verifications made, the information submitted by certain paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be cleared in this Decision. Annex II lists the paying agencies concerned.
(8) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, in liaison with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 of 26 September 2000 on budgetary discipline (5) lays down that advances against booking are to be reduced for expenditure effected by the Member States after the limits or deadlines laid down. However, under Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, any overrun of deadlines during August, September and October is to be taken into account in the accounts clearance decision except where noted before the last decision of the financial year relating to advances. Some of the expenditure declared by certain Member States during the abovementioned period and for the measures for which the Commission did not accept any extenuating circumstances was effected after the statutory limits or deadlines laid down. This Decision should therefore lay down the relevant reductions. A decision will be taken at a later date, in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, definitively fixing the expenditure for which Community financing will not be granted regarding those reductions and any other expenditure which may be found to have been effected after the limits or deadlines laid down.
(9) The Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2040/2000 and Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96, has already reduced or suspended a number of monthly advances on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2004 financial year and makes in this Decision the reductions laid down in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96. In the light of the above, to avoid any premature or merely a temporary reimbursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision, without prejudice to further examination under Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.
(10) The second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph, shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2004, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with the first subparagraph. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken.
(11) In accordance with the final subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, this Decision, adopted on the basis of accounting information, does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules,","{'header': '20.5.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 127/22', 'title': ""COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 May 2005\non the clearance of the accounts of Member States' expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section, for the 2004 financial year\n(notified under document number C(2005) 1443)\n(2005/385/EC)"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States, accompanied by the information required for clearance and a certificate regarding the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts transmitted and the reports established by the certification bodies, clears the accounts of the paying agencies referred to in Article 4(1) of that Regulation.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 7(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 296/96 of 16 February 1996 on data to be transmitted by the Member States and the monthly booking of expenditure financed under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(2), account is taken for the 2004 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2003 and 15 October 2004.\n\n((3)) The time limits granted to the Member States for the submission to the Commission of the documents referred to in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) 1258/1999 and in Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 of 7 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section(3), have expired.\n\n((4)) The Commission has checked the information submitted and communicated to the Member States before 31\xa0March 2005 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments.\n\n((5)) Under the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, the accounts clearance decision referred to in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 must determine, without prejudice to decisions taken subsequently in accordance with Article 7(4) of the Regulation, the amount of expenditure effected in each Member State during the financial year in question recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section, on the basis of the accounts referred to in Article 6(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and the reductions and suspensions of advances for the financial year concerned, including the reductions referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96.

A decision will be taken at a later date, in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999, definitively fixing the expenditure for which Community financing will not be granted regarding those reductions and any other expenditure which may be found to have been effected after the limits or deadlines laid down.\n\n((9)) The Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No\xa02040/2000 and Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0296/96, has already reduced or suspended a number of monthly advances on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2004 financial year and makes in this Decision the reductions laid down in Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 296/96. In the light of the above, to avoid any premature or merely a temporary reimbursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision, without prejudice to further examination under Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999.\n\n((10)) The second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph, shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2004, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with the first subparagraph. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken.\n\n((11)) In accordance with the final subparagraph of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 and Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1663/95, this Decision, adopted on the basis of accounting information, does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nWith the exception of the paying agencies referred to in Article 2, the accounts of the paying agencies of the Member States concerning expenditure financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section in respect of the 2004 financial year are hereby cleared.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (1), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Examination of the supply balance shows that exportable amounts of rice are currently held by producers. This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 2004/2005 marketing year.
(2) In order to rectify this situation, it is appropriate to make use of export refunds in respect of zones which may be supplied by the Community. The special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the quantities of rice benefiting from refunds, and therefore to fix the amount of the export refund by tendering procedure.
(3) It should be stated that Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice (2) applies to this tendering procedure.
(4) For the sake of sound management of the markets, the tendering procedure should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92 (3).
(5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture (4), amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article specify the operative events applicable to advances and securities.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 7 October 2010
on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports
(2010/622/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 77(2)(a), in conjunction with Article 218(5), thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In order to harmonise their visa policy with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (1), some Member States granted visa waiver to the nationals of the Federative Republic of Brazil (‘Brazil’) prior to their accession to the Union, as Brazil figures on the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement.
(2) For constitutional reasons, Brazil cannot grant visa waiver to the Member States unilaterally; it is necessary to conclude a visa waiver agreement to be ratified by the Brazilian Parliament.
(3) Brazil has bilateral visa waiver agreements with most of the Member States, concluded either prior to their accession to the Union or prior to the establishment of the common visa policy. However, there are still four Member States with whom no bilateral visa waiver agreement was concluded in the past; therefore Brazil still requires a visa from the nationals of these Member States for short stays.
(4) It stems from the nature of the common visa policy and the exclusive external competence of the Union in this area that only the Union can negotiate and conclude a visa waiver agreement, and not the individual Member States.
(5) In view of the non-reciprocal treatment of Brazil towards certain Member States, the Council, by its Decision of 18 April 2008, authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement between the Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver in order to ensure a full reciprocal visa waiver.
(6) Negotiations on the agreement were opened on 2 July 2008 and concluded on 1 October 2009.
(7) Subject to its conclusion at a later date, the Agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports, initialled in Brussels on 28 April 2010, should be signed.
(8) This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (2); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(9) This Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (3); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application,","{'header': '20.10.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 275/3', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 October 2010\non the signing, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Federative Republic of Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports\n(2010/622/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In order to harmonise their visa policy with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement(1), some Member States granted visa waiver to the nationals of the Federative Republic of Brazil (‘Brazil’) prior to their accession to the Union, as Brazil figures on the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement.\n\n((2)) For constitutional reasons, Brazil cannot grant visa waiver to the Member States unilaterally; it is necessary to conclude a visa waiver agreement to be ratified by the Brazilian Parliament.\n\n((3)) Brazil has bilateral visa waiver agreements with most of the Member States, concluded either prior to their accession to the Union or prior to the establishment of the common visa policy.

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544) as a feed additive for weaned piglets, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of that micro-organism preparation has been authorised for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1444/2006 (2).
(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for weaned piglets. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 9 December 2009 (3) that Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (DSM 15544) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that the use of that preparation can improve the performance of the animals. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular to Article 106(1) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular to Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 of 28 June 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting(1) establishes certain measures in connection with the collection and storage of data related to counterfeit banknotes and coins and with access to these data.
(2) The fight against counterfeiting cannot be dealt with only at a euro area level; to this effect, the Council of the European Union has taken measures in relation to the euro under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (i.e. the third pillar); also, Council Regulation (EC) No 1339/2001 extends the effects of Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 to those Member States which have not adopted the euro as their single currency(2).
(3) The processes and systems already in place for the analysis of counterfeits and for the collection of information relating to counterfeiting need to be built on; the ECB had established the Counterfeit Analysis Centre and the Counterfeit Currency Database; it has become appropriate to reorganise and rename the latter as the ""Counterfeit Monitoring System"" (CMS) and define its characteristics.
(4) The ECB provides for the conditions that ensure the appropriate procedures for access to the relevant data of the CMS in compliance with Regulations (EC) No 1338/2001 and (EC) No 1339/2001. For this purpose, all national central banks (NCBs) of the European System of Central Banks need to establish their respective National Counterfeit Centres (NCCs) within each NCB and create the role of security administrator of the NCC. The ECB also reaches the necessary arrangements and agreements with the Commission and Europol in order to provide for their appropriate access to the data of the CMS and for the access of the European Technical and Scientific Centre also in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001. Any access should respect the relevant minimum security standards. This respect is essential because of the confidential nature of the data of the CMS. The confidential nature of the data means that the information that each of the users of the CMS obtains from the CMS should be used exclusively for the purpose of fulfilling their responsibilities in the fight against counterfeiting of the euro. Limiting access to the data of the CMS helps to ensure confidentiality.
(5) A manual of procedures and the minimum security standards in connection with the CMS are in the process of being approved by the Governing Council of the ECB. They will not be published due to the confidential nature of the data to be introduced and to be accessible in the CMS and to the importance of maintaining a confidential environment for the use of the CMS,","{'title': '2001/912/EC: Decision of the European Central Bank of 8 November 2001 on certain conditions regarding access to the Counterfeit Monitoring System (CMS) (ECB/2001/11)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe definitions contained in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 shall apply in this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nCounterfeit Monitoring System\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For Bacillus firmus I-1582 the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2011/123/EU (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC France received on 4 August 2010 an application from Bayer CropScience AG for the inclusion of the active substance Bacillus firmus I-1582 in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2011/123/EU confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 12 July 2011.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Bacillus firmus I-1582 (4) on 20 August 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft assessment report was finalised on 15 March 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for Bacillus firmus I-1582.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing Bacillus firmus I-1582 may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve Bacillus firmus I-1582.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing Bacillus firmus I-1582. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(8) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 24 October 2012, Luxembourg requested authorisation to apply a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, allowing Luxembourg to exempt from value added tax (VAT) taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000. Through that measure, those taxable persons would be exempted from all or some of the obligations in relation to VAT referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC.
(2) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Luxembourg by letter dated 9 November 2012. By letter dated 12 November 2012, the Commission notified Luxembourg that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.
(3) According to Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Member States, which have not exercised the option under Article 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC (2), may exempt from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 5 000 or the equivalent in national currency and may also grant graduated tax relief to taxable persons whose annual turnover exceeds the ceiling fixed by them for its application.
(4) Luxembourg has informed the Commission that it currently exempts from VAT taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 10 000 and that it makes use of the option of granting graduated tax relief with respect to taxable persons whose annual turnover is between EUR 10 000 and EUR 25 000. Luxembourg has requested the authorisation to exempt from VAT, as a derogating measure, taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25 000.
(5) A higher threshold for the special scheme is a simplification measure, in so far as it may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of small businesses and would enable Luxembourg to cease applying the graduated tax relief scheme that is burdensome for businesses. Taxable persons should be still able to opt for the normal VAT arrangements.
(6) On 29 October 2004, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a Council Directive amending Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC (3) with a view to simplifying valued added tax obligations, which included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100 000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating that amount each year. This Decision is in line with that proposal.
(7) The derogating measure has only a negligible effect on the overall amount of tax collected at the stage of final consumption and will not adversely affect the Union’s own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '27.11.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 316/33', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 15 November 2013\nauthorising Luxembourg to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2013/677/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 24 October 2012, Luxembourg requested authorisation to apply a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC, allowing Luxembourg to exempt from value added tax (VAT) taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 25\xa0000.

Having regard to the Treay establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (2), and in particular Article 23(1)(g) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down conditions to ensure that at all stages of the production, processing and distribution of products of animal origin within the Community do not cause any spread of diseases transmissible to animals. To this end it does not only list various disease-related treatments to inactivate the causative pathogen but first of all provides for the specific marking of such restricted products.
(2) The Directive, however, also provides for the possibility to lay down specific rules for its application, including the establishment of a special identification mark required for meat not authorised for placing on the market for animal health reasons.
(3) Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC, and in particular Article 23(1)(g) thereof, provides that poultry meat originating from holdings located in protection zones must not enter into intra-Community or international trade. For that reason such meat must, unless decided otherwise, bear the mark provided for in Annex II of Directive 2002/99/EC.
(4) Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 July 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease (3) and in particular Article 9(2)(f)(i) and paragraph 4(c) requires that meat derived from poultry originating from protection or surveillance zones does not enter intra-Community and that it bears a mark which corresponds to the special identification mark provided for in Annex II of Directive 2002/99/EC.
(5) Certain Member States have informed the Commission that that identification mark has been poorly accepted by operators and customers in the industry. Accordingly, it is appropriate to provide for an alternative identification mark that Member States may decide to apply, instead of the mark provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC. However, in the interests of controls, it is important that Member States inform the Commission beforehand, if they decide to apply the alternative identification mark in case of an outbreak of avian influenza or Newcastle disease.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (4), provides for an identification mark to be applied to certain meat of animal origin intended for placing on the market.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (5), provides for the temporary use of national identification marks for products of animal origin intended for human consumption which may only be marketed in the territory of the Member State where they are produced.
(8) The alternative identification mark provided for in this Decision should be clearly distinguishable from other identification marks to be applied to poultry meat in accordance with Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 or (EC) No 2076/2005.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 11b(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure the environmental integrity of the Community emissions trading scheme, Directive 2003/87/EC requires the Member States to ensure that when hosting project activities as established under the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), no emission reduction units (ERUs) or certified emission reductions (CERs) are issued for reductions or limitations of greenhouse gas emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme, as this would result in a double counting of emission reductions or limitations.
(2) Such reductions or limitations could in particular occur if: a project activity for fuel switching occurs in an installation falling under the Community emissions trading scheme, if a project activity in the municipal heat generation sector results in a lower production in another installation under the Community emissions trading scheme; or, if a project activity for a wind- or hydropower plant feeds electricity into the electricity grid, thereby replacing fossil fuel-based electricity generation.
(3) Recognising that Member States might have committed themselves before the adoption of Article 11b(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC to issuing ERUs or CERs that result in double counting, Article 11b(3) and (4) allow ERUs and CERs to be issued until 31 December 2012, even if the reductions or limitations of the project activities indirectly or directly reduce or limit the emissions of installations that fall under the Community emissions trading scheme, provided that an equal number of allowances is cancelled.
(4) Article 11b(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC differentiates between instances where it is possible to determine the extent of reductions or limitations in each installation under the Community emissions trading scheme that is affected by the project activity (direct reductions or limitations) and instances where the extent of reductions or limitations can only be determined for a group of installations under the scope of the Community emissions trading scheme (indirect reductions or limitations).
(5) For direct reductions or limitations, the operator of the installation where the reduction or limitation occurs is responsible for the cancellation of allowances corresponding to the quantity of ERUs and CERs issued for such reductions or limitations For indirect reductions or limitations, the national authorities are responsible for cancelling these allowances in the national registry of the Member State that issues the ERUs and CERs.
(6) The most appropriate way to account for reductions or limitations in an installation falling under the Community emissions trading scheme that result from a particular project activity is to calculate the share of such reductions or limitations within the total planned emission reductions or limitations of this project activity, as established by its approved baseline. If, in the case of indirect reductions or limitations, the quantity of reductions in individual installations falling under the Community emissions trading scheme cannot be identified exactly, the quantity of reductions or limitations within the total reductions or limitations of the project activity that would cause double counting should be estimated.
(7) The Community emissions trading scheme requires Member States to notify to the Commission the total quantity of allowances intended to be allocated for the 2008-2012 period in their national allocation plans 18 months in advance of the start of the period. The precise amount of emission reductions or limitations generated by a particular project activity is, however, established annually after these have taken place.
(8) A set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State hosting activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing each approved project activity and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (‘trading sector project-reductions’). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of ‘trading sector project-reductions’ anticipated for each project activity being hosted by the Member State.
(9) Another set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State intending to host activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing planned project activities and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (‘trading sector project-reductions’). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of ‘trading sector project-reductions’ anticipated for planned project activities to be hosted by the Member State.
(10) ERUs or CERs that represent ‘trading sector project-reductions’ may be issued up until 31 December 2012. Each such issuance should be notified to the Commission.
(11) In their national allocation plans, Member States hosting, or intending to host, activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting should indicate the projected emissions for activities falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC both with and without the effects of the anticipated trading sector project-reductions.

If, in the case of indirect reductions or limitations, the quantity of reductions in individual installations falling under the Community emissions trading scheme cannot be identified exactly, the quantity of reductions or limitations within the total reductions or limitations of the project activity that would cause double counting should be estimated.\n\n((7)) The Community emissions trading scheme requires Member States to notify to the Commission the total quantity of allowances intended to be allocated for the 2008-2012 period in their national allocation plans 18 months in advance of the start of the period. The precise amount of emission reductions or limitations generated by a particular project activity is, however, established annually after these have taken place.\n\n((8)) A set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State hosting activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing each approved project activity and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (‘trading sector project-reductions’). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of ‘trading sector project-reductions’ anticipated for each project activity being hosted by the Member State.\n\n((9)) Another set-aside should be established in the national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012 of each Member State intending to host activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting, listing planned project activities and its anticipated reductions or limitations of emissions that take place in installations that participate in the Community emissions trading scheme and for which ERUs or CERs should be issued by the Member State (‘trading sector project-reductions’). In addition, the set-aside table should contain all explanatory information needed to establish the extent of ‘trading sector project-reductions’ anticipated for planned project activities to be hosted by the Member State.\n\n((10)) ERUs or CERs that represent ‘trading sector project-reductions’ may be issued up until 31 December 2012. Each such issuance should be notified to the Commission.\n\n((11)) In their national allocation plans, Member States hosting, or intending to host, activities under the project-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which could cause double-counting should indicate the projected emissions for activities falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC both with and without the effects of the anticipated trading sector project-reductions.\n\n((12)) Member States should take into consideration any anticipated reductions or limitations caused by project activities that affect an installation or activity and would cause double counting when establishing their national allocation plan methodology for determining the allocation of individual installations.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThis Decision lays down provisions for the implementation of Article 11b(3) and (4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision, and in addition to the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2216/2004\n(\n2\n)\n, the following definitions shall apply:\n1.\n‘direct emission reduction or limitation’ means a reduction or limitation of emissions occurring due to a project activity which causes reductions or limitations of emissions in installations that are individually identified in the project activity’s baseline established pursuant to Article 1 of Appendix B to Decision 16/CP.7 of the United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (UNFCCC), or pursuant to Article 44 of the Annex to Decision 17/CP.7 of the UNFCCC;\n2.\n‘indirect emission reduction or limitation’ means any reductions or limitations of emissions in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC that is not a direct emission reduction or limitation;\n3.\n‘trading sector project-reduction’ means a reduction or limitation in emissions of installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC due to project activities for which a Member State hosting the project activity issues emission reduction units (ERUs) or certified emission reductions CERs;\n4.\n‘letter of approval’ means, in the case of project activities that generate ERUs, a binding obligation undertaken in a written form by the Member State hosting the project activity to issue ERUs in accordance with the Member State’s national guidelines and procedures for approving project activities as referred to in Article 20 (a) of the Annex to Decision 16/CP.7 of the UNFCCC; and in the case of project activities that generate CERs, a written approval of voluntary participation from the designated national authority of the Member State hosting the project activity as referred to in Article 40(a) of the Annex to Decision 17/CP.7 of the UNFCCC;\n5.\n‘letter of endorsement’ means an official communication in a written form by the Member State to host the project activity that it considers the project as one with a potential to gain eventual approval as a project activity.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0In its national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012, a Member State shall include in the total quantity of allowances a set-aside of allowances drawn up for each project activity in the format set out in the table in Annex I to this Decision if, prior to the deadline for the notification of its national allocation plan set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Member State has issued letters of approval as a host country, pledging to issue ERUs or CERs for project activities which result in emission reductions or limitations in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0In its national allocation plan for the period 2008 to 2012, a Member State may also include in the total quantity of allowances an additional set-aside of allowances drawn up in the format set out in the Annex II to this Decision if after the decision pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2003/87/EC it intends to issue letters of approval as a host country that pledge to issue ERUs or CERs before 31 December 2012 for project activities which result in emission reductions or limitations in installations falling under the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 imposed a 15 % ad valorem additional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America as from 1 May 2005. In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.
(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2006 (1 October 2005-30 September 2006). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 81.19 million.
(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has increased, the first 32 products of the list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 632/2006 should be added to the list in Annex I to that Regulation.
(4) The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 81.19 million.
(5) Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 contain specific exemptions from the additional import duty. Since the applicability of those exemptions is dependent on certain conditions being met before the entry into force or on the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005, the exemptions cannot in practice apply for imports of the 32 products now added to the list in Annex I. Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products.
(6) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.

Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products.\n\n((6)) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.\n\n((7)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on trade retaliation,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by Annex I to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 is replaced by Annex II to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Products for which an import licence with an exemption from, or a reduction of duty, was issued before the date of entry into force of this Regulation shall not be subject to the additional duty provided they are classified under one of the following CN codes\n(\n2\n)\n: 4803\xa000\xa031, 4818\xa030\xa000, 4818\xa020\xa010, 9403\xa070\xa090, 6110\xa090\xa010, 6110\xa019\xa010, 6110\xa019\xa090, 6110\xa012\xa010, 6110\xa011\xa010, 6110\xa030\xa010, 6110\xa012\xa090, 6110\xa020\xa010, 6110\xa011\xa030, 6110\xa011\xa090, 6110\xa090\xa090, 6110\xa030\xa091, 6110\xa030\xa099, 6110\xa020\xa099, 6110\xa020\xa091, 9608\xa010\xa010, 6402\xa019\xa000, 6404\xa011\xa000, 6403\xa019\xa000, 6105\xa020\xa090, 6105\xa020\xa010, 6106\xa010\xa000, 6206\xa040\xa000, 6205\xa030\xa000, 6206\xa030\xa000, 6105\xa010\xa000, 6205\xa020\xa000 and 9406\xa000\xa011.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Products for which it can be demonstrated that they are already en route to the Community on the date of application of this Regulation, and whose destination cannot be changed, shall not be subject to the additional duty provided they are classified under one of the following CN codes\n(\n3\n)\n: 4803\xa000\xa031, 4818\xa030\xa000, 4818\xa020\xa010, 9403\xa070\xa090, 6110\xa090\xa010, 6110\xa019\xa010, 6110\xa019\xa090, 6110\xa012\xa010, 6110\xa011\xa010, 6110\xa030\xa010, 6110\xa012\xa090, 6110\xa020\xa010, 6110\xa011\xa030, 6110\xa011\xa090, 6110\xa090\xa090, 6110\xa030\xa091, 6110\xa030\xa099, 6110\xa020\xa099, 6110\xa020\xa091, 9608\xa010\xa010, 6402\xa019\xa000, 6404\xa011\xa000, 6403\xa019\xa000, 6105\xa020\xa090, 6105\xa020\xa010, 6106\xa010\xa000, 6206\xa040\xa000, 6205\xa030\xa000, 6206\xa030\xa000, 6105\xa010\xa000, 6205\xa020\xa000 and 9406\xa000\xa011.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2007.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides for a complete revision of Community rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption, including the introduction of a number of strict requirements. In addition, it provides that appropriate transitional measures may be adopted.
(2) In view of the strict nature of those requirements, it is necessary to provide for non-renewable transitional measures for Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom in order to allow industry sufficient time to adjust. In addition, alternative collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and uses for animal by-products need to be further developed, as well as disposal methods for those by-products.
(3) Accordingly, as a temporary measure a derogation should be granted to Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom to enable them to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules to the separation of category 2 and 3 oleochemical plants.
(4) In order to prevent a risk to animal and public health, appropriate control systems should be maintained in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom for the period of the transitional measures.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (1), and in particular Article 60(2) and Article 145(c),
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 (2) introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005. Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.
(2) In order to facilitate the task of the national administrations in the framework of the implementation of Articles 54(2) and 61 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States should determine which areas are to be considered as permanent pasture for those areas in reparcelling schemes between the date for the aid application for 2003 and the date of application for the single payment scheme in the first year of implementation.
(3) According to Article 50(2) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004, in case of regional implementation of the single payment scheme as provided for in Article 58 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, Member States shall communicate the information referred to in Article 50(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 for each of the regions concerned, and, by 1 August of the first year of application of the single payment scheme at the latest, the corresponding part of the ceiling established in accordance with Article 58(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. For reasons of simplification, it is appropriate to replace the date of 1 August by the same date as that provided for the communication referred to in Article 50(1) of Regulation (EC) No 795/2004.
(4) Article 51 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 and made applicable as from 1 January 2005 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 394/2005, authorises Member States to allow secondary crops to be cultivated on the eligible hectares during a period of maximum three months starting each year on 15 August. It is appropriate to bring forward that date to allow the growing of temporary vegetable crops in regions where cereals are usually harvested sooner for climatic reasons as communicated by the Member States concerned to the Commission.
(5) According to Article 60(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 Member States implementing the regional option provided for in Article 59 of that Regulation may also use the parcels declared according to Article 44(3) of that Regulation for the production of products referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (3) or in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products (4) and of potatoes other than those intended for the manufacture of potato starch.
(6) Article 60(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provides that Member States shall establish the number of hectares that may be used according to paragraph 1 of that Article by subdividing, according to objective criteria, the average of the number of hectares that were used for the production of the products referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article at national level during the three-year period 2000 to 2002 amongst the regions defined pursuant to Article 58(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion and avoidance;
Whereas, by letter to the Commission registered on 19 March 1998, the Italian Republic requested authorisation to introduce a measure derogating from Articles 2 and 10 of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 27(3) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the other Member States were informed on 17 April 1998 of the request submitted by the Italian Republic;
Whereas the first purpose of the special measure is to exempt, without granting the right to deduct input tax, supplies of scrap metal and other recyclable materials made either by firms which have a fixed establishment and generated a turnover excluding tax of not more than ITL 2 billion during the previous year or by firms which do not have a fixed establishment;
Whereas the second purpose of the measure is to grant firms which have a fixed establishment and generated a turnover excluding tax of between ITL 150 million and ITL 2 billion during the previous year the right to opt for the normal taxation arrangements;
Whereas the third purpose of the measure is to apply VAT suspension arrangements, with the right to deduct input tax, to supplies of non-ferrous scrap, irrespective of the turnover excluding tax of the firm making them;
Whereas this measure is likely to prove an effective means of combating fraud which is becoming increasingly prevalent in this area;
Whereas, consequently, the special measure satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas the Commission adopted on 10 July 1996 a work programme and a timetable of proposals providing for gradual, step-by-step progress towards a common VAT system for the single market;
Whereas authorisation should be granted until 31 December 2000 so that an assessment can then be made of the compatibility of the measure with the overall approach adopted for the new common system of VAT;

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included hexythiazox.
(2) In accordance with Article 11e of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (4) was adopted on the non-inclusion of hexythiazox.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(4) The application was submitted to Finland, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) Finland evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 20 October 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on hexythiazox to the Commission on 7 September 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 March 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for hexythiazox.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing hexythiazox may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include hexythiazox in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit information confirming the risk assessment for the toxicological relevance and the potential occurrence of the metabolite PT-1-3 (7) in processed commodities, the potential adverse effects of hexythiazox on bee brood and the possible impact of the preferential degradation and/or conversion of the mixture of isomers on the worker risk assessment, the consumer risk assessment and the environment.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(9) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing hexythiazox to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (8) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(11) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(12) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of hexythiazox and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning hexythiazox in the Annex to that Decision.
(13) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 356/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 8 January 1997 the Commission received a complaint pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (hereafter the 'Regulation`). The complaint was lodged by Cotance, the Confederation of National Associations of Tanners and Dressers of the European Community, on behalf of those of its members that are engaged in production and/or finishing of bovine leather.
(2) The complainant alleged that a number of Argentinian measures on the export of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides and the import of finished leather are inconsistent with several provisions of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (hereafter 'WTO Agreement`) and its Annexes and that these measures are causing adverse trade effects to its member companies. On that basis the complainant asked the Commission to take the necessary actions to convince Argentina to repeal these practices consisting of: (a) a de facto export ban on raw hides; (b) a customs control procedure for raw hides in which experts of the Argentinian tanning industry participate; (c) the payment of additional value added tax and a statistic duty on finished leather imports; and (d) the advance payment of turnover tax when importing finished leather.
(3) The complaint contained sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of a Community examination procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation. Consequently, an examination procedure was initiated on 26 February 1997 (3).
(4) Following the initiation of the Community examination procedure the Commission conducted an in-depth legal and factual investigation. Based on the findings of this investigation the Commission reached the conclusions which are indicated below.
B. FINDINGS REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBSTACLE TO TRADE
(5) The investigation revealed that the Argentinian export regime for raw and semi-tanned bovine hides operate as a de facto export prohibition. It appears that, since 1972, the Argentinian authorities have shown a constant will to prohibit the export of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides by means of various measures, which all have succeeded in considerably restricting and finally making impossible the export of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides. Before 1972 there were regular and important trade flows in hides between Argentina and the Community.
The fact that this export regime succeeded in reaching its objective is demonstrated by the following elements: (a) the Argentinian authorities admit that there have been no (legal) exports of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides since 1987; (b) hide traders state that it is impossible to buy hides in Argentina for export purposes; and (c) the Argentinian tanning industry admits that the Argentinian hide market is not a free market. Furthermore, by availing themselves of Article XI:2(a) of GATT 1994, which is an exemption to the obligation not to maintain prohibitions or restrictions on exports, the Argentinian authorities appear to suggest that the country is maintaining an export prohibition, or at least export restrictions, in the sense of Article XI:1. Finally, an analysis based on Argentinian and US prices shows that, even after allowing for the export duty on bovine hides which exists in Argentina, the price of Argentinian hides should normally have reached a level at which it would have been possible to export.
This factual evidence indicates that Argentina maintains a de facto ban on the export of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides. Moreover, the investigation uncovered at least one government measure (namely the authorisation granted to the tanning industry to participate in customs control procedures of hides before export) designed to enforce this ban. Export prohibitions or restrictions are expressly ruled out by Article XI of GATT 1994. This provision thus provides the Community a right of action within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation against Argentina.
(6) Personnel appointed by the Argentinian chamber for the tanning industry are authorised to assist the Argentinian customs authorities in carrying out customs controls of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides before exports. Apart from being part of the export regime designed to make exports of hides impossible, this practice is in itself challengable under the provisions of GATT 1994. The participation of representatives of an industry which has an obvious interest in impeding the export of its raw material does not guarantee the impartial management of such procedure in the sense of Article X:3(a) of GATT 1994.
Therefore, with regard to this practice Article X:3(a) of GATT 1994 read in conjunction with Article XI:1 constitute international trade rules conferring on the Community a right of action within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation.
(7) Argentina applies an 'additional VAT` of 9 % on imported products. In practice this means that the VAT rate for imported goods is 30 % instead of 21 % for goods purchased on the domestic market. The VAT rate for imported goods is thus discriminatory when compared to the rate applied on domestic sales. The fact that the 'additional` VAT is only an instalment that can be deducted from the final settlement of VAT does not affect this analysis. Therefore the additional VAT is to be considered as a breach of the national treatment principle enshrined in Article III:2 of GATT 1994 which constitutes an international trade rule conferring the Community a right of action within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation.
(8) Operators who import foreign goods into Argentina must pay an 'advance turnover tax` of 3 % of the price of the goods. Although it is treated as a credit for the taxpayer when he presents his tax declaration it clearly implies a discrimination in favour of Argentinian input material for the manufacture and finished consumer goods. Therefore, also with regard to this 'advance turnover tax`, Article III:2 of GATT 1994 constitutes an international trade rule conferring the Community a right of action within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation.
(9) Under these circumstances the Commission considers that the complainant's allegations are well-founded.
(10) The Commission nonetheless considers that reference to the above legal bases does not rule out recourse to any other pertinent provision of the WTO Agreement and of the Agreements annexed to it, which could be of use in procedures before the WTO.
C. FINDINGS REGARDING ADVERSE TRADE EFFECTS
(11) At present, the export prohibition makes it totally impossible for Community tanners to purchase raw bovine hides in Argentina, although this investigation has shown that, for various reasons, Community tanneries are very interested in sourcing bovine hides from Argentina.
(12) Despite Argentina's important hide production, its contribution to international trade in bovine hides is negligible. Argentina's absence from international trade in this commodity reduces the international availability of this product and consequently affects the Community tanning sector's security of supply.
(13) The Argentinian measures on the export of bovine hides entail a further risk of further proliferation of export restrictions. In this regard, Argentina's Mercosur partners may be a matter for concern.
(14) The Community tanning sector depends heavily on imported hides. As a result of export restrictions maintained by Argentina and subsequently by other countries, tanneries need more supplying countries for an ever growing part of their supplies, which implies increasing uncertainty and additional costs.
(15) As a result of the export measures, the Argentinian market is insulated from the casual movements of world market prices, which leads to an artificial reduction of the local price for Argentinian hides.
(16) Because raw material prices are artificially low, Argentinian tanners have a cost advantage over foreign manufacturers that have to pay prices influenced by the world markets. Given the high share of raw material in leather production costs, the cost advantage of Argentinian tanners is therefore considerable. It is therefore established that, with an artificially cheap raw material, Argentinian bovine leather tanners can undercut their EC competitors substantially.
(17) Argentina has significantly increased its exports of finished leather since the implementation of export restrictions as from 1972. Since the Argentinian leather producers benefit from a considerable unfair competitive advantage, it is clear that an important part of their export successes stem from this advantage. Under normal and fair circumstances of competition, Community tanners could at least have held part of the market shares that are now held by Argentinian leather throughout the world.
(18) Most EC bovine leather tanners have lost market shares in the Community since the beginning of the decade, while Argentina increased its market share in a number of Community Member States. Here again parts of these market share gains are due to the Argentinian tanners' unfair competitive advantage.
(19) The Argentinian measures on exports of raw and semi-tanned bovine hides seriously impede trade flows in these products and endanger the Community tanning industry's security of supply in raw materials. They also result in an unfair competitive advantage for Argentinian leather producers, which allows them to undercut prices of their EC competitors. Therefore, the Commission concluded that abovementioned effects do constitute adverse trade effects within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the Regulation. Moreover, the Commission found that, as in the event of an Argentinian upswing in the demand of Community leather they may discourage processors from buying Community leather, the additional VAT on imports and the advance payment of income tax raised on imports result in potentially adverse trade effects that are likely to develop into actual trade effects within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the Regulation.
D. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(20) Ensuring that WTO partners fully comply with their obligations is of the utmost importance for the Community which has committed itself to the same obligations.
(21) If the Community does not react against the present barriers to trade, the number of countries maintaining export restrictions or prohibitions may increase further in the coming years, adding new and severe distortions to trade, which will further affect Community producers of leather.
(22) The Argentinian practices affect a Community tanning industry which is faced with increasing low-cost competition from Asian and Latin American tanners. In a world leather market where the number of participants is growing, the market share available to each is getting smaller and smaller. In such a context any unfair competitive advantage leads to severe market distortions, and should therefore effectively be challenged.
E. CONCLUSIONS AND MEASURES TO BE TAKEN
(23) The investigation has established that it will take no remedy other than a radical change in the regime applicable in Argentina to exports of bovine hides and imports of finished leather to eliminate the actual and potential adverse trade effects of abovementioned obstacles to trade.
(24) Intensive discussions have been held with the relevant Argentinian authorities to discuss this matter further aimed at finding an amicable solution to the problems concerning hide and leather trade. More particularly, the Commission services met the Argentinian authorities on 30 and 31 March 1998 in Buenos Aires. On this occasion, the Argentinian authorities agreed to the objective of fully liberalising their hide exports by January 2000 and accepted to notify the phasing out scheme of the export tax on bovine hides to the WTO. The Argentinian authorities also showed a certain flexibility and agreed to explore the possible means to amend the customs regulation authorising the Argentinian leather industry to participate in customs control of hides before export.
However, despite their expressed willingness to find a mutually satisfactory solution and after five months of discussing the modalities of such a solution with the Commission, the Argentinian authorities have so far failed to notify their objective of fully liberalising trade in hides and the phasing out scheme of the export tax on bovine hides to the WTO, and have not yet amended the Regulation on customs control of hides before export.
(25) In these circumstances, it appears that the interests of the Community call for initiation of WTO dispute settlement proceedings,","{'title': '98/618/EC: Commission Decision of 23 October 1998 under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 concerning measures maintained by the Republic of Argentina on the export of bovine hides and the import of finished leather (notified under document number C(1998) 3206)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

(2009/338/EC)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), and in particular Articles 3.1, 12.1 and 12.3 and Articles 17, 18 and 22 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) At its meeting of 6 July 2006, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to explore, in cooperation with central securities depositories (CSDs) and other market participants, the possibility of setting up a new Eurosystem service for securities settlement, to be called TARGET2-Securities (T2S). As part of its tasks in accordance with Articles 17, 18 and 22 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Eurosystem envisages that T2S will be a service based on a single platform allowing for core, neutral and borderless pan-European cash and securities settlement, which will be offered to CSDs to enable them to provide their customers with harmonised and commoditised delivery-versus-payment settlement services in central bank money in an integrated technical environment.
(2) On 17 July 2008, the Governing Council decided to launch T2S and to provide the resources required until its completion. On the basis of an offer made by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de España, the Banque de France and the Banca d’Italia, the Governing Council also decided that T2S would be developed and operated by these four national central banks (NCBs).
(3) The effective and efficient organisation of T2S involving both internal and external stakeholders requires the establishment of a streamlined management body that will develop proposals for the Governing Council on key strategic issues and execute tasks of a purely technical nature (hereinafter the ‘T2S Programme Board’).
(4) Under the principle of decentralisation laid down in Article 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, to the extent deemed possible and appropriate, NCBs carry out operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem. The Eurosystem central banks will therefore entrust the T2S Programme Board with certain implementing tasks so that it can be fully operational and act on behalf of the whole Eurosystem. The Payment and Settlement Systems Committee (PSSC) will maintain its advisory role to the ECB’s decision-making bodies,","{'header': '22.4.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 102/12', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 19 March 2009\non the establishment of the TARGET2-Securities Programme Board\n(ECB/2009/6)\n(2009/338/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) At its meeting of 6 July 2006, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to explore, in cooperation with central securities depositories (CSDs) and other market participants, the possibility of setting up a new Eurosystem service for securities settlement, to be called TARGET2-Securities (T2S).

The T2S services will allow for the core, neutral and borderless, i.e. pan-European, settlement of securities transactions on a delivery-versus-payment (DVP) basis in central bank money, on a single technical platform integrated with the real-time gross settlement systems settling in central bank money of each participating currency.\nIn view of the provision of the T2S Services, the ECB Governing Council, as ultimate decision-making body of the Eurosystem, established the T2S Programme Board to assist the ECB decision-making bodies in ensuring the successful and timely completion of the T2S programme.\nThe T2S Programme Board is also based on a T2S Protocol signed by the Eurosystem central banks. Without prejudice to the ultimate decision-making powers of the ECB decision-making bodies, the T2S Programme Board is entrusted with the autonomous performance of clearly defined executive tasks related to the T2S programme. The T2S Programme Board will report directly to the Governing Council regularly. The advisory functions of ESCB committees, in particular the PSSC, LEGCO and the EISC, are not affected by the establishment of the T2S Programme Board. The T2S Programme Board may seek and receive guidance from the Governing Council on T2S related issues in case of uncertainty or doubt.\nIf and when new issues related to T2S arise, the T2S Programme Board may be assigned further clearly defined executive tasks. In light of the Governing Council’s final competence in T2S issues, any tasks performed by the T2S Programme Board may be addressed by the Governing Council.\nOBJECTIVES\nBased on this mandate, the T2S Programme Board ensures that the T2S programme is implemented:\n—\nin accordance with market expectations, as reflected in the user requirement document (URD) dated 21 May 2008, as amended from time to time,\n—\nwithin the budget defined by the Governing Council,\n—\nno later than June 2013.\nRESPONSIBILITIES\nIn view of meeting its objectives, the T2S Programme Board is responsible for:\n—\nsubmitting proposals to the ECB decision-making bodies on T2S issues that are of a strategic nature and might have an impact on the timely and successful implementation of the T2S programme within the agreed parameters,\n—\nmanaging the T2S programme on a daily basis,\n—\nmanaging the relations with T2S clients and external stakeholders,\n—\nreporting on the T2S programme to the ECB decision-making bodies on a regular and structured basis,\n—\ninteracting with the 4CB.\nTASKS\nIn view of fulfilling its responsibilities, the following executive tasks are assigned to the T2S Programme Board:\n1.\nElaboration of proposals for ultimate decision by the Governing Council\nThe T2S Programme Board elaborates proposals in the following fields:\n—\nT2S governance,\n—\nT2S finances, including:\n—\ntimely proposals on issues related to the compliance with the stated T2S objective of full cost recovery (e.g. in case T2S does not attract sufficient volume) and the possible resulting financial risk, the Eurosystem may be exposed to,\n—\nproposals in light of the outcome of the T2S Programme Board’s negotiations with the 4CB regarding the ‘conditional fixed price offer’ (including the payment schedule),\n—\nproposals on the annual budget managed by the T2S Programme Board,\n—\nproposals concerning the T2S cost methodology, and\n—\nproposals regarding the T2S pricing policy,\n—\noverall T2S programme planning,\n—\nany contract to be signed between the Eurosystem and external stakeholders,\n—\nT2S risk management framework (and acceptance of remaining risks),\n—\nservice level agreements (SLAs) to be established with the CSDs and NCBs and the 4CB,\n—\nT2S migration strategy,\n—\ncrisis management strategy.\n2.\nProgramme management\nThe T2S Programme Board:\n—\nperforms the overall management of the T2S programme,\n—\nestablishes a detailed plan, on the basis of the overall T2S programme plan, as approved by the Governing Council,\n—\nassesses, validates and accepts the 4CB deliverables, according to pre-agreed quality standards, and in particular ensures that they are consistent with the URD,\n—\nvalidates proposals from the 4CB, in particular on IT strategy, network provision and capacity planning strictly related to T2S,\n—\napproves payment of instalments to the 4CB, according to an agreed schedule approved by the Governing Council (conditional fixed price offer), once the 4CB deliveries have been accepted by the T2S Programme Board,\n—\ncoordinates proper change management (URD),\n—\nestablishes test scenarios and later coordinates tests between the various stakeholders,\n—\nimplements the T2S risk management framework within the parameters set by the Governing Council,\n—\nimplements the T2S migration strategy within the parameters set by the Governing Council,\n—\nimplements the T2S crisis management strategy within the parameters set by the Governing Council,\n—\nensures compliance of the T2S service with regulatory requirements.\n3.\nRelations with external stakeholders\nThe T2S Programme Board:\n—\nensures that the T2S service meets the market needs,\n—\nmaintains close relations with the CSDs (jointly with the Eurosystem central banks) and non-euro area NCBs. The chairperson of the T2S Programme Board chairs the T2S Advisory Group or its successor body,\n—\nnegotiates with CSDs (jointly with the Eurosystem central banks) and NCBs, including contracts for development and operational phases (to be endorsed by the Governing Council),\n—\nperforms, with the help of the central bank expert network, a central role in the communication on T2S vis-à-vis market participants and public authorities,\n—\nconducts all T2S related harmonisation work,\n—\nclosely cooperates with all relevant public authorities or private bodies (e.g. the EU Commission and the European Parliament, securities regulators), on relevant initiatives in the field of securities clearing and settlement,\n—\nensures transparency through the timely and consistent publication of relevant documentation.\n4.\nReporting\nThe T2S Programme Board:\n—\nprepares quarterly reports to the Governing Council.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) and Article 8(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat (2) establishes the sanitary conditions for the importation into the Community of live animals excluding equidae, and the importation of fresh meat of such animals, including equidae, but excluding meat preparations.
(2) Decision 79/542/EEC provides that imports of fresh meat intended for human consumption are only allowed if such meat comes from a territory of a third country or a part thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision, and the fresh meat meets the requirements set out in the appropriate veterinary certificate for that meat in accordance with the models set out in Part 2 of that Annex, taking into account any specific conditions or supplementary guarantees required for the meat.
(3) Botswana is listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC and has been divided into different territories, mainly according to their animal health status. Those territories are authorised to export to the Community de-boned and matured fresh meat of domestic bovine animals, of domestic sheep and goats, and of certain farmed and wild non-domestic animals (fresh meat).
(4) On 20 October 2008, an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was suspected in a farm located in the district of Ghanzi, situated in the veterinary disease control zone 12 of Botswana. That veterinary disease control zone is at present authorised to export fresh meat to the Community. As soon as the outbreak was confirmed, the competent authority in Botswana suspended exports of fresh meat to the Community.
(5) In view of these circumstances, imports into the Community of fresh meat from the veterinary disease control zone 12 of Botswana should no longer be authorised. Considering that the competent authority in Botswana has provided sufficient guarantees regarding the measures put in place to control the spread of the disease and considering that the affected areas are completely fenced it is appropriate to limit that restriction to veterinary disease control zone 12 only.
(6) The description of the territory BR-1 of Brazil excludes from the territories authorised to export fresh de-boned and matured bovine meat into the Community an area called the ‘high surveillance zone’. This consists of a strip of 15 km along the border with Paraguay that covers a number of municipalities, including Caracol and Antônio João that were not included. It is therefore opportune to add these two municipalities to the description of the ‘high surveillance zone’ in the territory BR-1.
(7) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '6.1.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 2/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 18 December 2008\namending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards the entry for Botswana and Brazil in the list of third countries or parts thereof from which imports into the Community of certain fresh meat are authorised\n(notified under document number C(2008) 8516)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/4/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat(2)establishes the sanitary conditions for the importation into the Community of live animals excluding equidae, and the importation of fresh meat of such animals, including equidae, but excluding meat preparations.\n\n((2)) Decision 79/542/EEC provides that imports of fresh meat intended for human consumption are only allowed if such meat comes from a territory of a third country or a part thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Decision, and the fresh meat meets the requirements set out in the appropriate veterinary certificate for that meat in accordance with the models set out in Part 2 of that Annex, taking into account any specific conditions or supplementary guarantees required for the meat.\n\n((3)) Botswana is listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC and has been divided into different territories, mainly according to their animal health status.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 33(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
(3) The second subparagraph of Article 33(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products should also comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3), and of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82 of 20 July 1982 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals (5), the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 838/2007 (6) should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) There is a need to extend in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 the possible use of micro-organisms for compost activation to cover also the use of such organisms for improving the overall condition of the soil and the availability of nutrients in the soil or crops. It is also necessary to exclude any genetically modified micro-organisms for such uses, and to bring the provisions concerning the use of livestock manure in line with the provisions related thereto in part B, section 7 of this Annex.
(2) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 7(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, certain Member States have submitted information in view of the inclusion of certain products in Annex II or in view of amending certain provisions in this Annex.
(3) The amendments of Annex II concern products which were in common use before the adoption of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 according to the codes of practice on organic farming followed in the Community and, therefore, are in accordance with the provisions of Article 7(1a) of that Regulation. The amendments for certain of these products are urgent in the light of the upcoming agricultural season.
(4) It appeared that ""glycerol"", ""silicon dioxide"" and ""isopropanol"" are essential for the preparation of certain foodstuffs. These products can therefore be included in Annex VI taking into account the requirements of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 207/93(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 345/97(4), defining the content of Annex VI to Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91.
(5) It is necessary to clarify in the ""General principles"" of Annex VI that the practice of smoking is accepted in the preparation of foodstuffs from organic production.
(6) It is necessary to bring the provisions in Annex VI, with regard to genetically modified organisms and products derived from such organisms, in line with the overall prohibition accepted in the context of Council Regulation (EC) No 1804/1999(5).
(7) It is appropriate to introduce for certain products minor technical or editorial amendments. It is also necessary to introduce certain editorial amendments to take into account amendments of Regulation (EC) No 1804/1999.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1),

Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 327/98 of 10 February 1998 opening and providing for the administration of certain tariff quotas for imports of rice and broken rice (3), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 327/98 opened and provided for the administration of certain import tariff quotas for rice and broken rice, broken down by country of origin and split into several subperiods in accordance with Annex IX to that Regulation.
(2) September is the fourth subperiod for the quotas laid down in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98, the third subperiod for the quotas laid down in Article 1(1)(d) and the first subperiod for the quota laid down in Article 1(1)(e).
(3) The notifications presented under Article 8(a) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 show that, for the quotas with order numbers 09.4112 – 09.4168, the applications lodged in the first ten working days of September 2011 under Article 4(1) of the Regulation cover a quantity greater than that available. The extent to which import licences may be issued should therefore be determined by establishing the allocation coefficient to be applied to the quantities requested under the quotas in question.
(4) It is also clear from the notifications that, for the quotas with order numbers 09.4127 – 09.4128 – 09.4129 – 09.4130 – 09.4116 – 09.4117 – 09.4118, the applications lodged in the first ten working days of September 2011 under Article 4(1) of the Regulation cover a quantity less than that available.
(5) The quantities not used for the September subperiod of the quotas with order numbers 09.4127 – 09.4128 – 09.4129 – 09.4130 are transferred to the quota bearing the order number 09.4138 for the following subperiod under Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 327/98.
(6) The total quantities available for the following subperiod should therefore be fixed for the quotas with order numbers 09.4138 and 09.4168, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 327/98.
(7) In order to ensure sound management of the procedure of issuing import licences, the present Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,","{'header': '24.9.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 247/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 952/2011\nof 23 September 2011\non the issue of licences for importing rice under the tariff quotas opened for the September 2011 subperiod by Regulation (EC) No 327/98', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 327/98 opened and provided for the administration of certain import tariff quotas for rice and broken rice, broken down by country of origin and split into several subperiods in accordance with Annex IX to that Regulation.\n\n((2)) September is the fourth subperiod for the quotas laid down in Article\xa01(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98, the third subperiod for the quotas laid down in Article\xa01(1)(d) and the first subperiod for the quota laid down in Article 1(1)(e).\n\n((3)) The notifications presented under Article 8(a) of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 show that, for the quotas with order numbers 09.4112 – 09.4168, the applications lodged in the first ten working days of September 2011 under Article 4(1) of the Regulation cover a quantity greater than that available.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 (1), and in particular Article 7(4)(a) and Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission conducted a study on the implementation of waste-related provisions of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.
(2) The proposed concentration limits in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 are considered the most appropriate to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment in view of the destruction or irreversible transformation of the persistent organic pollutants.
(3) For toxaphene, a mixture of over 670 substances, no agreed and relevant analytical methodology to determine the total concentration is available. However, the above mentioned study did not identify any stocks consisting of, containing or contaminated with toxaphene in the European Union. In addition, the study demonstrated that, whenever any persistent organic pollutant pesticides were detected in wastes, their concentrations were usually high when compared with the proposed concentration limits. For the time being, the available analytical methodologies for the determination of toxaphene may be considered adequate for the purposes of this Regulation.
(4) The concentration limit for PCDF/PCDD is expressed in toxic equivalent concentration (‘TEQ’), using the 1998 World Health Organisation toxic equivalency factors (‘TEFs’). Available data on dioxin-like PCBs are not sufficient to include these compounds in the TEQ.
(5) Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) is the name of a technical mixture of various isomers. The effort to completely analyse them would be disproportionate. Only alpha-, beta- and gamma-HCH is of toxicological relevance. Therefore, the concentration limit exclusively refers to them. Most commercially available analytical standard mixtures for the analysis of this compound class only identify these isomers.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The Committee provided for in Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 has not delivered an opinion on the measures laid down in this Regulation, following its consultation, on 25 January 2006, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17(2) of that Regulation,","{'header': '8.8.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 217/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1195/2006\nof 18 July 2006\namending Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Commission conducted a study on the implementation of waste-related provisions of Regulation (EC) No\xa0850/2004.\n\n((2)) The proposed concentration limits in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 are considered the most appropriate to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment in view of the destruction or irreversible transformation of the persistent organic pollutants.\n\n((3)) For toxaphene, a mixture of over 670 substances, no agreed and relevant analytical methodology to determine the total concentration is available.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(4) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.

Halted by Italian authorities, the attempted export of the yachts destined for Kim Jong-il was in violation of United Nations sanctions against North Korea under UNSCR 1718, which specifically requireMember States to prevent the supply, sale, or transfer of luxury goods to North Korea.\nOffice 39 previously used Banco Delta Asia to launder illicit proceeds. Banco Delta Asia was identified by the Treasury Department in September 2005 as a “primary money laundering concern” under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, because it represented an unacceptable risk of money laundering and other financial crimes.’""}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2884/2000(4); the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(7), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas under Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 it may be decided to grant production refunds on sugar, unprocessed isoglucose and syrups covered by that Regulation which are used in the manufacture of certain products of the chemical industry;
Whereas the third subparagraph of Article 28 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 states that provision may be made for all or part of the financial losses resulting from the granting of any production refunds to be borne by the beet growers and the manufacturers; whereas use should be made of this possibility for the sugar used by the chemical industry over and above the usual quantities;
Whereas a system of production refunds should be introduced which will enable the outlets for sugar to expand beyond the usual quantities; whereas, to this end, the products in question should henceforth be made available to the chemical industry at a lower price level;
Whereas sugar can be used as a basic product by the chemical industry in the same way as starch products; whereas a harmonious development should therefore be assured for the use of these basic products; whereas, to that end, provision should be made for the application of a system of production refunds taking account of the price of sugar, the value of maize needed for the manufacture of the chemical products in question, the production refunds granted for starch products under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1009/86 of 25 March 1986 laying down general rules applicable to production refunds for cereals and rice (3) and the trend in world sugar prices; whereas in view of the links between the system of production refunds in the sugar sector and in the cereals sector, it should be laid down for the purposes of the system provided for in this Regulation that the marketing year is to be that defined by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1006/86 (5);
Whereas arrangements similar to those laid down for white sugar used by the chemical industry should be laid down for unprocessed isoglucose;
Whereas raw sugar and syrups with a high degree of purity, calculated in accordance with Article 1 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1443/82 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3819/85 (7), should also qualify for the production refunds if used in the chemical industry; whereas the production refund on these basic products should therefore be that for white sugar, adjusted by reference to yield or sucrose content as appropriate; whereas, as far as isoglucose is concerned, production refunds should be granted subject to the same conditions as the export refunds on that product;
Whereas, to prevent abuses, provision should be made for the production refund to be granted only if other uses are excluded by means of controls; whereas, if such controls are to be possible, the production refund should be paid only to the processor and on application by the processor;
Whereas controls may, in certain cases, be rendered more effective if provision is also made for an approval procedure; whereas the Member State in the territory of which processing takes place should therefore be free to decide whether or not processors must obtain such approval;
Whereas, to keep pace with technological developments in this sector, provision should be made for changes to the original list of the chemical products in question to be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81;
Whereas this Regulation is intended to repalce Council Regulation (EEC) No 1400/78 of 20 June 1978 laying down general rules for the production refund on sugar used in the chemical industry (1); whereas the latter Regulation should therefore be repealed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1010/86 of 25 March 1986 laying down general rules for the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93 lays down that, where, in the case of a given quarter and a given origin, for a country or group of countries referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 478/95, the quantities covered by import licence applications from one or more of the categories of operators appreciably exceed the indicative quantity fixed, a reduction percentage to be applied to applications shall be set; whereas, however, that provision does not apply to category C licence applications nor to category A and B applications relating to a quantity of 150 tonnes or less, provided that the total quantity covered by the category A and B applications does not exceed, for a given origin, 15 % of the total of the quantities applied for;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(1), and in particular Article 12(2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000(2) of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999(3) on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period, and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period, a programme for agriculture and rural development was approved by Commission Decision C(2000) 3329 final on 27 November 2000 for the Republic of Lithuania.
(2) The Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the Commission, acting on behalf of the European Community, signed on 5 March 2001 the Multiannual Financing Agreement laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Sapard programme.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 provides that the ex ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 may be waived on the basis of a case-by-case analysis of national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance. Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 provides for detailed rules for the carrying out of the said analysis. The competent authority of the Republic of Lithuania has appointed the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture for the implementation of measures: ""Investments in agricultural holdings"", ""Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products"", ""Development and diversification of economic activities providing for multiple activities and alternative income"", ""Improvement of rural infrastructure"" and ""Vocational Training"", as defined in the programme for agriculture and rural development that was approved by Commission Decision C(2000) 3329 final on 27 November 2000 for the Republic of Lithuania. The National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme.
(4) On 16 November 2001 the Lithuanian authorities provided the revised list of eligible expenditure in conformity with Article 4(1), Section B of the Multiannual Financing Agreement. The Commission did not raise objectives to this list.
(5) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, the Commission has analysed the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance and has established that, for the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the Republic of Lithuania complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(6) In particular, the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture has implemented the following key accreditation criteria satisfactorily: written procedures, segregation of duties, pre-project approval and prepayment checks, payment procedures, accounting procedures, computer security, internal audit, and, where appropriate, public procurement provisions.
(7) The National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance has implemented the following criteria satisfactorily for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for the Republic of Lithuania: audit trail, treasury management, receipt of funds, disbursement to the National Paying Agency, computer security and internal audit.
(8) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance in the Republic of Lithuania the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(9) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission are based on an operational but not operating system it is therefore appropriate to confer the management of the Sapard programme on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance on a provisional basis.
(10) Full conferral of management of the Sapard programme is only envisaged after further verifications, in order to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily, have been carried out and after any recommendations the Commission may issue, with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the National Paying Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and on the National Fund Department within the Ministry of Finance have been implemented,","{'title': '2001/857/EC: Commission Decision of 26 November 2001 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Lithuania in the pre-accession period', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe requirement of ex ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting by the Republic of Lithuania is hereby waived.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nManagement of the Sapard programme is conferred on a provisional basis to:\n\n1. the National Paying Agency (Nacionalné mokéjimo agentura) under the Ministry of Agriculture, Gedimino pr. 19, LT-2025 Vilnius, Republic of Lithuania, for the implementation of measures: ""Investments in agricultural holdings"", ""Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fisheries products"", ""Development and diversification of economic activities providing for multiple activities and alternative income"", ""Improvement of rural infrastructure"" and ""Vocational training"" as defined in the programme for agricultural and rural development that was approved by Commission Decision C(2000)3329 final on 27 November 2000; and\n\n2. the National Fund under the Ministry of Finance, J.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9 (4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (3), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC, and in particular Article 10 (4) thereof,
Whereas according to the second subparagraph of Article 9 (1) of Directive 89/662/EEC and the second subparagraph of Article 10 (1) of Directive 90/425/EEC, the Member State of origin or dispatch is required to implement on its territory the appropriate measures to prevent all situations likely to constitute a serious hazard to animals or to human health;
Whereas the plan for the control and eradication of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom presented to the Commission by the United Kingdom on 3 June 1996, as amended on 19 June 1996, was approved by Commission Decision 96/385/EC (4);
Whereas the United Kingdom, in the abovementioned plan, proposed that the actions of the selective culling programme should consist in essence of:
(a) identifying cases of BSE in cattle born in the period from 1 July 1989 to June 1993;
(b) tracing all other cattle born on the same farms as those cattle in the same period (birth cohort) and slaughtering those animals;
Whereas in some instances calves are separated from their dams and moved from the herd in which they were born (natal herd) to rearing premises before they receive solid feed; whereas the most likely source of infection is contaminated feed; whereas, therefore, those calves, if they later contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy, are most likely to have become infected on the rearing premises and not in their natal herd;
Whereas an inspection mission on the assessment of the progress made in the implementation of the programme to eradicate BSE in the United Kingdom was conducted by the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission from 3 to 6 March 1997 and from 9 to 13 June 1997; whereas it was observed that in Great Britain cohorts were only being generated from animals in the herds in which a BSE case was born; whereas it was, for epidemiological reasons, recommended that the generation of cohorts should not be limited to animals born in those natal herds but should be extended to other herds where the BSE case was first exposed to potentially contaminated feed and to animals which were moved into those natal herds;
Whereas Article 3 of Decision 96/385/EC requires the United Kingdom to notify the Commission of any intentions to modify the plan; whereas according to the same Article, that Decision should be re-examined as soon as possible following such notification;
Whereas the United Kingdom notified the Commission on 4 June 1997 of some operational changes which they proposed to make to the selective culling programme; whereas the United Kingdom on 17 October 1997 formally submitted to the Commission an amendment to insert the following new paragraph 10.10A in the selective culling programme:
'In some cases the BSE case received no solid feed in its natal herd. In operating the cull it will be assumed, unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, that infection took place on the first premises on which the BSE case received solid feed; and that other calves reared with it on those premises, irrespective of their herd of birth, may be exposed. A veterinary investigation will be carried out and a cohort will be formed by reference to the feeding, management and movement records at those premises;`
Whereas the proposed amendment will further reduce the number of BSE cases, and it should therefore be approved by means of an amendment to Decision 96/385/EC;
Whereas the Commission, in accordance with point 9 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996, has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 1484/96 (5), in order to provide market support;
Whereas further amendments to the programme to eradicate BSE in the United Kingdom are anticipated, in particular in the light of new scientific evidence on maternal transmission; whereas the United Kingdom submitted on 2 October 1997 a proposal with regard to the compulsory slaughter of all offspring of BSE cases born after 1 August 1996 in conjunction with a proposal for a date-based export scheme, to the Commission; whereas this proposal has been submitted to the appropriate scientific committee for evaluation;
Whereas, for the avoidance of doubt, it should be provided that animals that have been culled under a similar extension of the selective culling programme before this Decision takes effect are covered by the programme;

THE COMMISSION OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 522/94 (2), and in  particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) 1506/94 (3) (hereinafter referred to as the 'provisional duty Regulation'), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of urea-ammonium-nitrate solution ('UAN') originating in Bulgaria  and Poland, and falling under CN code 3102 80 00. By Regulation (EC) No 2620/94 (4), the Council extended the validity of this duty for a period not exceeding two months.
(2) In the subsequent procedure it was established that definitive anti-dumping measures should be taken in order to eliminate injurious dumping. The findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC)  3319/94 (5).
(3) Having been informed of those conclusions, the Bulgarian producer and exporter offered an undertaking with regard to the import prices to independent customers in the Community pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. According to this  undertaking, import prices will be at a non-injurious level as established in the framework of the present anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) In addition, since the Bulgarian producer and eaxporter have undertaken to submit detailed and regular sales information to the Commission and not to enter into direct or indirect compensatory arrangements with their customers, it has been concluded  that the correct observance of the undertaking can be effectively monitored by the Commission.
(5) In view of the provisions of Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the undertaking should enter into force on the same date as the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) 3319/94 in the present proceeding.
(6) In those circumstances, the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the investigation can, therefore, be terminated with respect to the Bulgarian producer and exporter concerned.
(7) The producer and exporter concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the definitive anti-dumping measures were proposed and have had the opportunity to comment on all aspects of the investigation.  Accordingly should the undertaking be withdrawn or should the Commission have reason to believe that the undertaking has been violated, it may, where the interests of the Community so require, apply provisional anti-dumping duties forthwith under
Article 10
(6) of Regulation (EEC) 2423/88 and, subsequently definitive anti-dumping duties could be imposed by the Council.
(8) When the Advisory Committee was consulted on the acceptance of the undertakings offered, several Member States raised objections. Therefore, in accordance with Article 9 and 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission sent a report to the  Council on the results of the consultations and a proposal that the investigation be terminated by the acceptance of undertakings. Consequently, in accordance with the said Articles 9 and 10 (1) this Decision will only take effect and be published if  the Council does not decide otherwise within one month,","{'title': '94/825/EC: Commission Decision of 12 December 1994 accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of urea ammonium nitrate solution originating in Bulgaria and Poland', 'articles': [{'id': '10', 'title': 'Article 10', 'text': 'Article 10\n\n(6) of Regulation (EEC) 2423/88 and, subsequently definitive anti-dumping duties could be imposed by the Council.\n\n(8) When the Advisory Committee was consulted on the acceptance of the undertakings offered, several Member States raised objections.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 47/2003(2), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1176/2002(4), lays down the detailed rules of application for export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant exports, the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds, within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, prices on the international market. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons, table grapes and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports, it is appropriate to proceed by an open invitation to tender and to set the indicative refund amount and the scheduled quantities for the period concerned.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1391/78 [3], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1799/79 [4], it was possible to lodge applications for the non-marketing premium only up to 15 September 1980, although by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 1365/80 the system of conversion premiums has been extended up to the end of the 1980/81 milk marketing year;
Whereas Article 12a of Regulation (EEC) No 1391/78 provided beneficiaries of the conversion premium with the opportunity of opting subsequently for the non-marketing premium system; whereas, in that case, the situation of those concerned is adapted to that which would have been the case if they had applied at the outset for the non-marketing premium ;
Whereas, with regard to beneficiaries of the conversion premium who lodged their application as from 16 September 1980, it should be specified that, since the non-marketing premium system has been abolished with effect from that date, the option referred to above was not available to them since it would no longer have been possible for them to apply for the said premium at the outset;
Whereas, with regard to beneficiaries of the conversion premium who lodged their application before 16 September 1980, keeping the option available would be such as to circumvent the abolition of the nonmarketing system as from that date; whereas, in these circumstances, it should be laid down that, at the expiry of a transitional period, the said beneficiaries of the conversion premium can no longer exercise that opinion ;

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 4 February 2014
repealing Decision 2000/745/EC accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) originating, inter alia, in India
(2014/109/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic anti-subsidy Regulation’), and in particular Articles 13 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) Countervailing measures on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (‘PET’) originating in India have been in force since 2000 (2). These measures have been last maintained by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 (3), following an expiry review.
(2) Anti-dumping measures on imports of PET originating in India have been in force since 2000 (4). These measures have been last maintained by Council Regulation (EC) No 192/2007 (5), following an expiry review. On 24 February 2012 the Commission initiated a subsequent expiry review. By Implementing Decision 2013/226/EU (6), the Council rejected the Commission’s proposal for a Council implementing regulation maintaining the anti-dumping duty on imports of PET originating in, inter alia, India and, thus, the anti-dumping measures expired.
(3) In 2000, by Decision 2000/745/EC (7) the Commission accepted price undertakings (‘the undertakings’), offered in connection with both the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings from, inter alia, the Indian companies: Pearl Engineering Polymers Limited (‘Pearl’) and Reliance Industries Limited (‘Reliance’). In 2005, by Decision 2005/697/EC (8) amending Decision 2000/745/EC, the Commission accepted an undertaking from the Indian company South ASEAN Petrochem Limited which as a result of a merger changed its name to Dhunseri Petrochem & Tea Limited (‘Dhunseri’) (9).
B.   CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNDERTAKINGS
(4) A change in the circumstances during the implementation of the undertakings may justify a decision of the Commission to exercise its power to withdraw the acceptance of the undertakings, as set out in Article 13(9) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.
(5) The repeal of the anti-dumping measures and the maintenance of countervailing duties constitute a change in the circumstances under which the undertakings were accepted. The undertakings were accepted in the presence of both anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures. The core element of the undertakings, the Minimum Import Price (‘MIP’), reflects both the dumping and subsidy element. Currently, there is no dumping element. Therefore, the MIP is not at the appropriate level.
C.   BREACHES OF THE UNDERTAKING
(6) In addition, one of the Indian companies, Pearl, did not respect its reporting obligation vis-à-vis the Commission. The company failed to submit quarterly sales reports. The Commission is thus unable to effectively monitor the undertaking.
(7) The provisions of the undertaking stipulate that failure to submit reports constitutes a breach of the undertaking. A recent ruling of the Court of Justice (10) also confirmed that reporting obligations must be regarded as primary obligations for the proper functioning of an undertaking.
(8) The acceptance of Pearl’s undertaking has to be withdrawn also on this basis.
D.   WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS
(9) The three companies were granted the opportunity to be heard and make written submissions. Two Indian companies and the Committee of PET Manufacturers in Europe (CPME), representing the Union industry, commented.
1.   Changed circumstances as a ground for withdrawing the acceptance of an undertaking
(10) One company claimed that the proposal to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking lacked a legal basis. That party claimed that Article 13(9) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation did not explicitly mention ‘changed circumstances’ and linked any possibility to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking with instances of breach. This argument had to be rejected. Article 13(9) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation indeed does not explicitly mention ‘change in circumstances’. However, it clearly does not limit the instances in which the Commission may withdraw the acceptance of an undertaking to instances of breach. It states that ‘[i]n case of breach or withdrawal of undertakings by any party to the undertaking, or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission [emphasis added], the acceptance of the undertaking shall, after consultation, be withdrawn…’. It therefore singles out the withdrawal of acceptance of an undertaking as a stand-alone basis for withdrawal.
(11) In fact, the Commission’s discretionary powers to accept or reject an undertaking offer have to be mirrored by the power to withdraw the acceptance of an undertaking, should the circumstances on the basis of which the undertaking offers were accepted change. According to the case-law of the Court, ‘it is for the institutions, in the exercise of their discretionary power, to determine whether […] undertakings are acceptable.’ (11). That discretionary power is in general wide in the sphere of measures to protect trade, because the Union Courts recognize that in that sphere, the Institutions have to examine complex economic, political and legal situations. More specifically, the Court held that the Commission, ‘when exercising the powers assigned to it in [the basic Regulation], has a very wide discretion to decide, in terms of the interests of the Community, any measures needed to deal with the situation which it has established.’ (12). Hence, the Commission, when accepting, rejecting or withdrawing an undertaking, enjoys the discretion necessary in order to be able to implement trade measures in the Union interest.
(12) The Commission therefore rejects the argument that a change in circumstances, as compared to those which prevailed at the time of the acceptance of the undertaking, cannot serve as a ground for withdrawal of that acceptance.
2.   Consistency of the withdrawal with previous legal acts concerning the same proceeding
(13) One company claimed that Commission Decision 2013/223/EU (13) reconfirmed the acceptance of its undertaking. A related argument was that Article 2(2) of the Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 imposing a definitive countervailing duty constituted another recognition that the undertaking could remain in force after the expiry of the anti-dumping duties. Both arguments are misguided. By Decision 2013/223/EU, the Commission withdrew the acceptance of the undertakings of one Indonesian and one Indian company that violated their reporting obligations. A withdrawal for one company does not in any way preclude a subsequent decision of the Commission to withdraw acceptance of other undertakings should such action be warranted in light of circumstances of a particular case.
(14) Consequently, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013, published on 23 May 2013 reflected the amendment of Decision 2000/745/EC due to the adoption of Decision 2013/223/EU (withdrawal for one Indonesian and one Indian company). Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 imposing a definitive countervailing duty was published on the same day as Implementing Decision 2013/226/EU by which the Council repealed the anti-dumping duty. The consequences of the latter decision could only be assessed by the Commission after its adoption.
(15) The arguments of the party had to be thus rejected.
3.   Mathematical adaptation of the MIP
(16) One company requested that the Commission should deduct from the MIP an amount corresponding to the fixed anti-dumping duty and thereby bring the MIP in compliance with the underlying measure — countervailing duty. Such an operation could not be performed. First and foremost, under the terms of the undertaking any revision of the scope and the minimum prices is only possible through an interim review in accordance with Article 19 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. Secondly, the company requested a mere deduction from the current MIP of amounts corresponding to the amount of the fixed anti-dumping duty. In the current undertaking the MIP and the indexation mechanism are based either on the non-injurious price established for the Union market (target price) or on the normal value (depending on the company in question) as determined in 1999. In the latter case, since the anti-dumping duty expired the whole basis for the MIP is non-existent. Had the undertaking been assessed only with regard to the countervailing duty, the export price (increased by the amount of the fixed countervailing duty) could have become a benchmark for the MIP. In order to establish an appropriate MIP, the Commission would have to first identify export price that would serve as a benchmark. No such benchmark can be easily identified in the present case, not least because measures have been in force for a long time. Further, the indexation mechanism currently in place that relates to the non-injurious price (target price) or the normal value cannot be simply transposed to the export price. Any simple mathematical adaptation would have required that all elements necessary to calculate the MIP are easily identifiable and undisputable. Only then the Commission can guarantee the equivalence of the undertaking to the measure in force. This condition is not fulfilled in the present case. A simple mathematical operation as suggested by the applicant is therefore impossible.
(17) The Commission has to act timely with regard to the undertaking in force in order to follow the decision of the Council to repeal the anti-dumping duties in force. Therefore, any further delay has to be avoided. The withdrawal of the acceptance of the undertaking does not prejudice any possible future decision, should a company wish to submit an undertaking offer.
(18) Following the second disclosure of the Commission’s findings, one party reiterated that the minimum import price should be decreased by a simple mathematical operation. It contested the Commission’s reasoning in that regard as ‘misplaced and lacking any basis’. However, that position has not been substantiated any further and thus has to be rejected. In any case, the claim has been address in recital 16 above.
(19) Consequently, the claim to mathematically adjust the MIP had to be rejected.
4.   Pending case T-422/13
(20) One company claimed that undertakings should remain in force pending the decision of the General Court in case T-422/13 CPME and Others v Council. According to that company, should the Union industry be successful in their challenge of Council Implementing Decision 2013/226/EU repealing the anti-dumping duties, the Commission would be under obligation to reinstate the undertaking. This argument is misguided. The Commission has to assess the current situation and act timely in order to follow the decision of the Council to repeal the anti-dumping measures. An anticipation of a possible outcome of a court case cannot guide Commission’s decisions in that regard. In view of this fact, the decision concerning the undertakings in force has to be taken in a timely manner.
5.   Breaches of the undertaking
(21) One company claimed that breach of reporting obligations by one company should not have any consequences upon other companies. It is hereby confirmed that only the company Pearl was found in breach of its reporting obligations.
6.   Possible review and undertakings
(22) Two Indian companies claimed that undertakings should remain in force pending the results of a possible interim review of the MIP. The Commission notes that because the anti-dumping duty expired the basis for the MIP has become non-existent (see recital 16 above). A decision to address the effects of this change has to be taken in a timely manner. In parallel, a company can request a review of the measure in place and in that context offer a new undertaking concerning only the anti-subsidy measures in force.
(23) Following the second disclosure of the Commission’s findings, one party reiterated that the Commission should have initiated an ex-officio interim review while the undertaking should remain in force pending the outcome of such review.
(24) The Commission notes first and foremost that the initiation of an anti-subsidy review investigation lies within its discretionary powers. However, in this particular case a review investigation is linked to the wish of an exporter to offer a new undertaking. Thus, the Commission has no reason to initiate a review without a new undertaking offer from the exporter concerned, in line with Article 13 of the basic Regulation.
(25) Further, as an equivalent form of measures, an undertaking has to correspond to the underlying measure imposed by the Council. This is no longer the case and thus has led the Commission to propose to withdraw the undertaking in force.
(26) Parties can indeed request an interim review based on the provisions of the basic anti-subsidy regulation and any possible new undertaking offer would be considered in the framework of any such review.
7.   Anti-subsidy duty as a barrier to imports
(27) Following the second disclosure of the Commission’s findings, one party claimed that the withdrawal of the acceptance of the undertaking ‘rather than reducing the level of protection in line with the expiry of the anti-dumping measures, (…) [would] make it impossible for users of PET to import’. The Commission notes in that regard that in the absence of an undertaking, the minimum import price ceases to be a benchmark for an exporter. The party did not substantiate why the countervailing duty would prevent Indian exporters from importing. In any case, the purpose of imposing measures and accepting an undertaking, if appropriate, is not about the possibility of users to import. The purpose is establishing a level of protection, as the party notes. The interests of users have been assessed under the Union interest for imposing measures together with the interests of all other parties concerned. It has been concluded that the imposition of measures is not against the Union interest. The argument had to be therefore rejected.
8.   Conclusion on submissions by parties
(28) None of the arguments raised by interested parties was such as to alter the Commission’s proposal to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking.
E.   REPEAL OF DECISION 2000/745/EC
(29) In view of the above, the acceptance of the undertakings should be withdrawn and Decision 2000/745/EC should be repealed. Accordingly, the definitive countervailing duties imposed by Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 461/2013 should apply to imports of PET produced by the companies Dhunseri, Reliance and Pearl (TARIC additional code A585 for Dhunseri, TARIC additional code A181 for Reliance and TARIC additional code A182 for Pearl.),","{'header': '28.2.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 59/35', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 4 February 2014\nrepealing Decision 2000/745/EC accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate (PET) originating, inter alia, in India\n(2014/109/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2000/745/EC is repealed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council (1), and in particular Article 14 in conjunction with Article 17 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) The maximum residue limit (‘MRL’) for pharmacologically active substances intended for use in the Union in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals or in biocidal products used in animal husbandry is to be established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009.
(2) Pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding MRLs in foodstuffs of animal origin are set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 (2).
(3) Ivermectin is currently included in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 as an allowed substance, for all mammalian food producing species, applicable to fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals producing milk for human consumption.
(4) On 15 December 2010 the Commission requested that the European Medicines Agency issue a new opinion on the substance ivermectin to include the possibility of establishing a MRL for tissue muscle.
(5) On 9 June 2011 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (‘CVMP’) adopted an opinion recommending the establishment of MRLs for ivermectin in tissues, including muscle, for all mammalian food producing species.
(6) On 25 October 2011 the Commission requested that the CVMP reconsider its opinion of 9 June 2011 and amend the part referring to residue levels at the injection site in the ‘Other provisions’ of Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010.
(7) On 12 September 2013, the CVMP adopted a revised opinion recommending the establishment of a MRL for ivermectin for all mammalian food producing species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals from which milk is produced for human consumption. The CVMP recommended in its revised opinion that, for the purpose of monitoring the residues of ivermectin that, where the entire carcass is available, fat, liver or kidney should be sampled in preference to muscle as residues in these tissues deplete more slowly than residues in muscle.

continuing and updating the scope of prior surveillance of imports of certain iron and steel products originating in certain third countries
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 of 26 February 2009 on common rules for imports (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009 of 7 July 2009 on common rules for imports from certain third countries (2) and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultations with the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 76/2002 (3), the Commission introduced prior Community surveillance of imports of certain iron and steel products originating in third countries.
(2) The Union’s external trade statistics are not available within the periods established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1917/2000 (4).
(3) Although the situation has changed since the introduction of surveillance in 2002, developments in the world steel market continue to require a reliable and quick information system on the future imports of the Union.
(4) The trends of imports of the products currently under surveillance as well as stainless steel flat products and large welded tubes, currently not under the surveillance system, were examined. It was deemed necessary to examine trends for these additional products given the fact that they represent the most value-added products on the market.
(5) In the last years, imports into the EU of those steel products increased substantially (by 40 %) in absolute terms between 2005 and 2008. Even if imports started to decrease since the end of 2008, imports merely followed the drop in demand and, in terms relative to consumption, they remained significant.
(6) Worldwide steel production capacities have grown in 2006-2008 and are expected to continue to grow until 2010. Two-digit capacity growth in the next 2 years is expected in a variety of regions especially in China, India, Brazil and the Middle East. China, the most important country in terms of increasing capacity, represents today about 40 % of the world crude steel making capacity and about three times the EU’s yearly consumption of steel.
(7) Given the fact that the EU is an important market for steel in terms of size and price, especially in the context of a strong currency, it is likely that once the market recovers and the demand on the Union market improves, any excess in steel capacity would be re-directed to the EU. In comparison, access to third country markets has been reduced to a various extent recently as countries in several geographical areas (such as Americas, Asia, Middle East) have taken measures to protect or support their steel industry. These measures took different forms, including tariff increases, licensing requirement, buy local requirements, and concern markets with a significant share of the global consumption.
(8) The production of crude steel and stainless steel flat products in the EU reached the highest level in 2007 and 2006 respectively, and then started decreasing in 2008. During the first semester 2009 there was a contraction of 43,2 % compared to the first semester of 2008 as opposed to a contraction in world steel output of 22,4 % during the same period. The crisis has had an impact on all the largest steel producing countries of the EU, and as a reaction steel producers have reduced the number of days of production, thus increasing the idle capacity.
(9) All producers have significantly reduced employment. In June 2009 around 40 % of the work force in the EU steel sector was affected by the economic crises in the form of permanent or temporary lay-offs and short-time working.
(10) On the basis of recent trends in imports of steel products, of the current vulnerable situation of the EU industry, the continuing weak demand on the EU market and of the likelihood that current and future excess capacity would be re-directed to EU if demand would recover, a threat of injury to Union producers pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 can therefore be deemed to exist.
(11) Thus, the Union interest requires that imports of certain steel products should continue to be subject to prior surveillance in order to provide advanced statistical information permitting rapid analysis of import trends. Rapid and anticipated trade data is necessary to deal with the vulnerability of the European steel market to sudden changes on world steel markets. This is particularly important in the present crisis situation marked by uncertainties as to whether the demand will structurally pick up and whether the EU industry will actually benefit from it.
(12) Furthermore, in view of the developments on the market of flat stainless steel products and large welded tubes and the situation of the industries at stake, and given that similar steel import monitoring systems include these products, it is appropriate that the scope of this system includes the products listed in Annex I.
(13) Taking into account the developments mentioned above, and taking into consideration that other major steel producing countries such as Canada and the United States of America have recently decided to extend their similar steel import monitoring systems (extended until 31 August 2011 and 21 March 2013, respectively), it is appropriate that this system should continue until 31 December 2012.
(14) In order to minimise unnecessary constraints and not disturb excessively the activities of companies close to the borders, the net weight of imports that are excluded from the application of this Regulation remains at 2 500 kilograms,","{'header': '17.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 332/54', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1241/2009\nof 16 December 2009\ncontinuing and updating the scope of prior surveillance of imports of certain iron and steel products originating in certain third countries', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Regulation (EC) No 76/2002(3), the Commission introduced prior Community surveillance of imports of certain iron and steel products originating in third countries.\n\n((2)) The Union’s external trade statistics are not available within the periods established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1917/2000(4).\n\n((3)) Although the situation has changed since the introduction of surveillance in 2002, developments in the world steel market continue to require a reliable and quick information system on the future imports of the Union.\n\n((4)) The trends of imports of the products currently under surveillance as well as stainless steel flat products and large welded tubes, currently not under the surveillance system, were examined.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133, in conjunction with Article 300(2), subparagraph 1, first sentence, thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Poland, of the other part(1) (hereinafter referred to as the Europe Agreement), provides for certain reciprocal trade concessions for certain agricultural products.
(2) Article 20(5) of the Europe Agreement provides that the Community and Poland shall examine product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis the possibilities of granting each other further concessions.
(3) The first improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement were provided for in the Protocol adjusting trade aspects of the Europe Agreement to take account of the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture, including improvements to the existing preferential arrangements, approved by Council Decision 2002/63/EC(2).
(4) Improvements to the preferential arrangements were also provided for as a result of negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade concluded in 2000. On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 January 2001 by Regulation (EC) No 2851/2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Poland(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol.

of 21 September 1984
renewing the authorization of an agreement between United Kingdom steelmaking undertakings concerning a joint buying agency for steelmaking materials (Steelmaking Supplies Ltd)
(Only the English text is authentic)
(84/477/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Article 65 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision 74/77/ECSC of 22 January 1974 authorizing an agreement between British steelmaking undertakings for the establishment of a joint buying agency for ferrous scrap and other steelmaking materials (1) and to Commission Decision 77/437/ECSC (2) renewing that authorization,
Having regard to the application submitted on 18 June 1982, amended by letter of 9 March 1984, by Steelmaking Supplies Ltd, London,
Whereas:
(1) By its Decision 74/77/ECSC, the Commission authorized an agreement between certain steelmaking undertakings in the private sector of the United Kingdom steel industry to establish a joint buying and consultative agency for ferrous scrap and other steelmaking materials. The agreement was authorized for an initial period of three years until 1 January 1977.
(2) The agency in question was duly established under the name Steelmaking Supplies Ltd (SSL) in London.
(3) By its Decision 77/437/ECSC, the Commission renewed that authorization until 30 June 1982.
(4) By application dated 18 June 1982, amended by letter of 9 March 1984, SSL requested on behalf of the undertakings concerned the renewal of that authorization for a further five years.
(5) The undertakings concerned are the following:
- Barworth Flockton Ltd, Sheffield,
- Brymbo Steel Works Ltd, Brymbo,
- Rich. W. Carr & Co. Ltd, Sheffield,
- Manchester Steel Ltd, Manchester,
- F. M. Parkin Ltd, Sheffield,
- Sanderson Kayser Ltd, Sheffield,
- Sheerness Steel Co. Ltd, Sheerness,
- Spear and Jackson Ltd, Sheffield.
(6) The principal features of the agreement are:
(i) SSL may be employed by all or some of the parties to make joint purchases of scrap or other steelmaking materials as may be determined on their behalf by the management committee of SSL, when these purchases cannot be more satisfactorily achieved by the parties acting independently;
(ii) to determine the need for the employment of SSL, the parties regularly exchange information through SSL on the prices paid for scrap or such other steelmaking materials as may be agreed by them from time to time;
(iii) SSL may also be employed by the parties to further their studies of the direct reduction of iron ore for use as a steelmaking raw material and to make arrangements for the supply of such material;
(iv) each party to the agreement has the power to appoint a representative to the management committee of SSL.
(7) The agreement restricts normal competition within the common market in that the parties agree to allocate products and sources of supply through SSL and to exchange price information for this purpose. The agreement therefore falls within the prohibition in Article 65 (1).
(8) The agreement is, however, strictly analogous in nature and effect to a joint buying agreement and can therefore be authorized if it continues to meet the conditions set out in Article 65 (2) (a), (b) and (c).
(9) Since the last renewal of the authorization the parties have not used SSL for the joint buying of scrap or other steelmaking materials because of the low demand for scrap and other steelmaking materials. When the steel market recovers, however, and gives rise to a greater pressure of demand for scrap, the parties want to have the possibility of employing SSL to undertake joint purchases (including joint imports) of scrap and other steelmaking materials on their behalf. This will help the parties to combat the dominant buying position of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) in the British market for scrap and other steelmaking materials. This dominant position of the BSC has been strengthened in recent years through the setting-up of BSC/Private Sector joint ventures (Allied Steel and Wire, Sheffield Forgemasters), which has brought previously private sector undertakings (Guest Keen & Nettlefolds (GKN) (South Wales) and Firth Brown Ltd) under the joint control of BSC and has weakened to the same extent the SSL, of which GKN and Firth Brown Ltd were members. This evolution could make the agreement under certain circumstances even more necessary for the rest of its members.
(10) The exchange of information on the prices of scrap and other steelmaking materials is appropriate in so far as it enables the parties to ascertain whether joint buying would be advantageous.
(11) No new restrictions have been introduced into the agreement since the last renewal of the authorization. In particular, no restrictions have been introduced into any joint purchasing contract which would compel the parties to buy the materials in question only through SSL. The agreement is therefore no more restrictive than is necessary for its purpose, and it is essential for the required result - an improvement in supplies of steelmaking materials - taking into consideration the structure of the British market for steelmaking materials.
(12) There were 15 parties to the agreement when the first authorization was renewed in June 1977. This number has now been reduced to eight. Some of the original members have been deleted from the list as they no longer make steel (Duport Steels Ltd, Edgar Allen Balfour Steel Ltd, Dunford Hadfields Ltd, Lloyd Cooper Ltd, Neepsend Ltd, Osborn Steels Ltd, Patent Shaft Steel Works Ltd, Round Oak Steel Works Ltd, Spartan Redheugh Ltd, Wolsingham Steel Co Ltd) or because they have merged with certain BSC steel works and become BSC/Private Sector joint ventures; this is the case with GKN South Wales Ltd (now in Allied Steel and Wire (ASW)) and with Firth Brown Ltd (now in Sheffield Forgemasters).
Some new members have entered into the agreement (Rich. W. Carr & Co. Ltd, Barworth Flockton Ltd and F. M. Parkin Ltd).
(13) In the last three years (1981, 1982, 1983) private sector crude steel production in the UK was 1 852 000 tonnes, 1 579 000 tonnes and 1 353 000 tonnes respectively. This production represented 12,1 %, 11,8 %, and 9,17 % respectively of total British crude steel production. These figures show that the private sector share in crude steel production is declining while the BSC share is increasing (87,9 %, 88,2 %, 90,83 % respectively), not least because of the acquisition of joint control over the BSC/Private Sector joint ventures.
(14) The same trend can also be observed in the purchase of scrap and ferro-alloys and other alloying materials. The private sector scrap purchase for the years 1981 and 1982 was 1 220 000 tonnes and 1 123 000 tonnes respectively, representing 38 % and 34 % respectively of the total UK steel industry purchases, while the market share of the BSC increased to 62 % and 66 % respectively. As to the purchases of ferro-alloys and other alloying materials, the private sector purchase for the years 1981 and 1982 was 36 700 tonnes and 31 100 tonnes respectively, representing 18 % and 15 % of the total UK steel industry purchase respectively, while the share of the BSC increased to 82 % and 85 % respectively.
(15) The above figures show that, although the existing SSL members represent about 95 % of UK private sector steel production, their combined buying strength is much smaller than that of the BSC, which is the dominant buyer of scrap and other steelmaking materials in the UK. Another point to be taken into account is the fact that the British scrap market is characterized by a large surplus: of the total scrap supply of 11,4 million tonnes in 1982, 3,1 million tonnes were exported.
In these circumstances the agreement will not give the parties the power to determine the prices or to control or restrict the production or mar keting of the materials in question within the common market or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings in the common market.
(16) In the circumstances the conditions set out in Article 65 (2) (a), (b) and (c) continue to be fulfilled, and this situation would not be altered if additional existing companies in the private sector of the UK steel industry were admitted into membership. Given the structure and developments in the UK steel industry and scrap sector, the Commission considers it appropriate to extend its authorization to cover the period ending on 31 December 1994,","{'title': '84/477/ECSC: Commission Decision of 21 September 1984 renewing the authorization of an agreement between United Kingdom steelmaking undertakings concerning a joint buying agency for steelmaking materials (Steelmaking Supplies Ltd) (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe duration of the validity of Decision 74/77/ECSC is hereby extended until 31 December 1994.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe following undertakings may be parties to the agreement for so long, within the period of the authorization, as they have not effected a concentration with the British Steel Corporation within the meaning of Article 66 of the Treaty:\n\n- Barworth Flockton Ltd, Sheffield,\n\n- Brymbo Steel Works Ltd, Brymbo,\n\n- Rich.

Whereas:
(1) Member States can only import fresh meat including offal from third countries or parts of third countries appearing on a list established by the Council on a proposal from the Commission.
(2) The list of these third countries or parts thereof is contained in Council Decision 79/542/EEC(4) as last amended by Commission Decision 2000/162/EC(5).
(3) Inclusion and retention of a third country on the lists of third countries provided for in Community legislation from which Member States are authorised to import products of animal origin covered by Directive 96/23/EC is subject to submission by the third country concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which it offers as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in Annex I of the Directive referred to; this plan must be updated at the request of the Commission, particularly when the checks referred to in Article 29(3) of the abovementioned Directive render it necessary.
(4) If the requirements of Article 29(1) of Directive 96/23/EC are not complied with, inclusion of a third country on the lists of third countries laid down by Community legislation may be suspended in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 33 of the Directive referred to.
(5) The application of residue monitoring plans, and the follow up to evidence of the use of unauthorised substances or of residue levels exceeding the Community maximum residue limits, are necessary to protect public health.
(6) Following deficiencies in the implementation of the residue monitoring programme identified by inspections carried out in the United States of America by the Commission in November 1999 and January/February 2000, the United States of America took measures to rectify the deficiencies reported; these measures were communicated to the Commission.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) In June 2001, the Commission adopted Decisions 2001/527/EC(1) and 2001/528/EC(2), setting up the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the European Securities Committee respectively.
(2) Decision 2001/528/EC established the European Securities Committee in its advisory capacity. Pursuant to Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation (market abuse)(3), the European Securities Committee may act as regulatory committee within the meaning of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
(3) In its Resolutions of 5 February 2002 and 21 November 2002, the European Parliament endorsed the four-level regulatory framework advocated in the Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of European securities markets and called for certain aspects of that approach to be extended to the banking and insurance sectors, subject to a clear Council commitment to guarantee a proper institutional balance.
(4) On 3 December 2002, the Council invited the Commission to take steps in order to transfer to the structures already established in the securities field the present functions and powers held by the UCITS (undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities) Contact Committee, set up by Council Directive 85/611/EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS)(5), as last amended by Directive 2001/108/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(6).
(5) The Commission has proposed a directive of the Council and the European Parliament, amending, inter alia, Directive 85/611/EEC to delete the functions of the UCITS Contact Committee under Article 53 of that Directive and to transfer those laid down under Article 53a of the same Directive to the European Securities Committee.
(6) Such an amendment will require a corresponding and simultaneous amendment of the competences of the European Securities Committee, as defined in Article 2 of Decision 2001/528/EC,","{'title': '2004/8/EC: Commission Decision of 5 November 2003 amending Decision 2001/528/EC establishing the European Securities Committee (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 2001/528/EC is amended as follows:'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 is replaced by the following:', 'text': 'Article 2 is replaced by the following:\n\n""Article 2\n\nThe role of the Committee shall be to advise the Commission on policy issues as well as on draft proposals the Commission might adopt in the field of securities, including on undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS).""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the same day as the entry into force of any directive amending the functions of the UCITS Contact Committee to transfer them to the European Securities Committee.\n\nDone at Brussels, 5 November 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrederik Bolkestein\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 191, 13.7.2001, p. 43.\n\n(2) OJ L 191, 13.7.2001, p. 45.\n\n(3) OJ L 96, 12.4.2003, p. 16.\n\n(4) OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.\n\n(5) OJ L 375, 31.12.1985, p. 3.\n\n(6) OJ L 41, 13.2.2002, p. 35.'}]}"

(2) The reasons given in the request, according to which such vehicle types meet the requirements of Annex IV to Directive 70/156/EEC, apart from Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/102/EC(4), are well founded.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1667/2000(2), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 75/91 of 11 January 1991 laying down the procedures and conditions for the disposal of paddy rice held by intervention agencies(3) provides among other things that rice held by intervention agencies is to be sold by tendering procedure at prices that allow market disturbances to be avoided.
(2) Italy has intervention stocks of paddy rice from harvests earlier than 1999 whose quality is in danger of deteriorating as a result of prolonged storage.
(3) Disposing of this rice on traditional markets inside the Community would inevitably trigger off, in the present production situation and when concessions for rice imports are being granted under international agreements, the placing of an equivalent quantity in intervention, which must be avoided.
(4) This rice could be disposed of in the animal feed sector, on special conditions.
(5) The undertakings given by tenderers are regarded as primary requirements within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(5).
(6) In order to ensure that the rice is used for the purpose specified, provision should be made for special monitoring and for the successful tenderer to provide a security, the conditions for the release of which should be laid down.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96(7), lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use of products from intervention. Procedures should also be laid down to ensure the traceability of the products used for animal feed.

Whereas:
(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, plants of strawberry (Fragaria L.), intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in non-European countries, other than Mediterranean countries, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the continental states of the USA, must not in principle be introduced into the Community.
(2) There is interest in the multiplication, in the Republic of Chile, of plants of Fragaria L., intended for planting, other than seeds, from plants supplied by a Member State, in order to prolong the producing season of the plants. The plants produced are afterwards exported to the Community to be planted for fruit production.
(3) For the 2001 season, by Commission Decision 2000/700/EC(3), derogations from certain provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of plants of Fragaria L., intended for planting, other than seeds, originating in the Republic of Chile have been authorised subject to specific conditions.
(4) The circumstances justifying those derogations are still valid. There is no new information giving cause for revision of the specific conditions.
(5) A derogation should therefore be authorised for a limited period, subject to specific conditions.
(6) The authorisation pursuant to this Decision shall be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in the Annex thereof are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms or have not been complied with.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/159/EEC of 17 April 1972 on the modernization of farms (1), and in particular Article 18 (3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 75/268/EEC of 28 April 1975 on mountain and hill farming and farming in certain less-favoured areas (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/160/EEC of 17 April 1972 concerning measures to encourage the cessation of farming and the reallocation of utilized agricultural area for the purposes of structural improvement (3), and in particular Article 9 (3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/161/EEC of 17 April 1972 concerning the provision of socio-economic guidance for and the acquisition of occupational skills by persons engaged in agriculture (4), and in particular Article 11 (3) thereof,
Whereas on 14 May 1975 the Government of Italy notified, pursuant to Article 17 (4) of Directive 72/159/EEC, Article 8 (4) of Directive 72/160/EEC and Article 10 (4) of Directive 72/161/EEC, Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 implementing the Directives of the Council of the European Communities on agricultural reform;
Whereas the Government of Italy pursuant to Article 17 (4) of Directive 72/159/EEC, further notified the following legal and administrative provisions up to 10 February 1976:    - Ministerial Decree of 7 November 1975 fixing the interest rates pursuant to Articles 18 and 19 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975;
- two Ministerial Decrees of 7 November 1975 fixing different interest rates for farm credit on immovable property and short-term loans;
- Circular No 6 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of 7 March 1975 concerning provisions governing agricultural credit;

- Circular No 4 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of 5 February 1976 concerning Law No 153 of 9 May 1975;
- Letter of 31 January 1976 fixing the comparable income pursuant to Article 17 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975;
Whereas under Article 18 (3) of Directive 72/159/EEC, Article 9 (3) of Directive 72/160/EEC and Article 11 (3) of Directive 72/161/EEC the Commission has to decide whether, having regard to the compatibility of the legal and administrative provisions notified with the abovementioned Council Directives, and taking into account the aims of those Directives and the necessary connection between the various measures, the conditions for financial contribution to the common measures referred to in Article 15 of Directive 72/159/EEC, Article 6 of Directive 72/160/EEC and Article 8 of Directive 72/161/EEC are satisfied;
Whereas the basic aim of Directive 72/159/EEC is to encourage the formation and development of farms which are capable, through the use of rational methods of production, of affording persons employed by them a fair income comparable with that from non-agricultural occupations and satisfactory working conditions;
Whereas to that end Directive 72/159/EEC requires the Member States to introduce a system of selective incentives for farmers who can prove, by submitting a development plan, that upon completion of the plan their farm will attain, in respect of at least one man-work unit, a level of earned income from agriculture comparable with that received for non-agricultural work;
Whereas the measures provided for in Articles 11 to 31 of the abovementioned Law No 153 of 9 May 1975, the abovementioned Ministerial Decrees of 7 November 1975, the Circulars of 7 March 1975, 10 December 1975 and 5 February 1976 and the Letter of 31 January 1976 all entail the introduction of a system of selective incentives within the meaning of Directive 72/159/EEC;
Whereas the Commission took the following factors into consideration when reaching its decision:    - the comparable income for 1976 fixed in the Letter of 31 January 1976 is, pursuant to the provisions of Article 17 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 and the third indent of Article 4 (4) (a) of Directive 72/159/EEC, determined with regard to the period covered by an approved development plan;
- when approving interest rate subsidies to the Ministerial Decrees of 7 November 1975 for farms which are not implementing a development plan, the regions comply with Article 31 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975, and hence with Article 14 (3) of Directive 72/159/EEC;
Whereas no system of selective incentives for farms within the meaning of the second alternative in Article 2 (2) of Directive 72/159/EEC, whose present structure is such as to jeopardize the maintenance of the earned income at a comparable level has yet been introduced pursuant to Article 25 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 in conjunction with the abovementioned Ministerial Decrees of 7 November 1975;
Whereas Article 18 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 fixes the investment volume qualifying for assistance on a farm with an approved development plan at Lit 25 million for each man-work unit ; whereas, however, Article 8 (2) of Directive 72/159/EEC provides that the interest rate subsidy is not to apply to any part of the loan exceeding 40 908 units of account or Lit 35 million per man-work unit ; whereas the aid fixed in Articles 23, 29 and 30 pursuant to Articles 10, 11 and 12 of Directive 72/159/EEC is also too low;
Whereas the abovementioned provisions could be such as to considerably limit the field of application of the system of selective incentives provided for in the Directive, or to limit the effectives of the aids provided for in the Directive, and this could in the long run jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of Directive 72/159/EEC ; whereas it is therefore necessary to bring the abovementioned provisions within the suitable period of 15 months into line with the provisions of the Directive;
Whereas, however, in view of the above decision that the proposed measures all make provision for the introduction of a system of selective incentives within the meaning of Directive 72/159/EEC, the provisions for implementing Directive 72/159/EEC may already be considered to satisfy the conditions for financial contribution by the Community, at least for the abovementioned period;
Whereas, however, the above decision cannot become affective until the Council, pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 8 (2) of Directive 72/159/  EEC, has authorized Italy to grant the aid mentioned in Article 18 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 and the Ministerial Decree of 7 November 1975 concerning Law No 153;
Whereas the basic aim of Directive 72/160/EEC is to make sufficient vacant land available for the creation of farms of suitable size and structure as specified in Article 4 of Council Directive 72/159/EEC on the modernization of farms;
Whereas to that end the Member States are therefore required:    - under Article 2 (1) (a) of Directive 72/160/EEC to grant annuities to farmers aged between 55 and 65 practising farming as their main occupation who leave agriculture;
- under Article 2 (1) (b) of Directive 72/160/EEC to grant farmers a premium, which is not to be eligible for assistance and is to be calculated by reference to the utilized agricultural area released;
- under Article 2 (1) (c) of Directive No 72/160/EEC to grant annuities to permanently hired or family workers aged between 55 and 65 who are employed on farms where the farmer benefits from any measure provided for in Article 2 (1) (a) or (b) of the Directive;
Whereas the grant of an annuity or premium is subject to the condition that the recipients cease working in agriculture and, if the recipient is a farmer, that he either sells or leases at least 85 % of his land to farms which are undergoing modernization pursuant to Directive 72/159/EEC, withdraws it from agricultural use, or sells or leases it to a land agency which must put the land to one of the abovementioned uses;
Whereas Member States may, on the ground of the age/or means of the prospective beneficiary, vary the amount of an annuity or premium or refuse to grant the same ; whereas they may reduce the annuity granted to permanently hired or family workers by the amount of any unemployment benefit which the beneficiary receives;
Whereas Articles 32 to 47 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 are consistent with the aim of Directive 72/160/EEC;
Whereas the basic aim of Title I of Directive 72/161/EEC is to enable those engaged in agriculture, and in particular persons who must fundamentally alter the nature of their activity, to take decisions on their future occupations and those of their children with full knowledge of the opportunities available and of the consequences of their choice;
Whereas to that end the Member States are therefore required:    - under Articles 2 (1) and 3 of Directive 72/161/EEC to create and develop services providing socio-economic guidance, such services being either public or expressly appointed and approved for that purpose by the Member States, or to create and develop within services already existing departments for the provision of such guidance;
- under Articles 2 (2) and 4 to introduce appropriate basic and advanced training programmes for socio-economic counsellors and to bear the cost of training such counsellors;
Whereas under the first indent of Article 12 (2) of Directive 72/161/EEC, the Guidance Section of the EAGGF refunds to Member States 25 % of a standard amount of 7 500 units of account in respect of each counsellor providing socio-economic guidance, within the meaning of Article 3 of the Directive, beginning his duties for the first time;
Whereas under the second indent of Article 12 (2) of Directive 72/161/EEC, the Guidance Section of the EAGGF refunds to Member States 25 % of the cost of training, within the meaning of Article 4 of the Directive, up to an overall amount of 4 500 units of account for each counsellor trained to provide socio-economic guidance within the meaning of Article 3 of the Directive;
Whereas the measures provided for in Articles 48 to 54 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 are consistent with the aim of Title I of Directive 72/161/EEC;
Whereas the basic aim of Title II of Directive 72/161/EEC is to give persons aged 18 or over engaged on agriculture the opportunity to acquire new agricultural skills, or to improve those which they already possess, so that they are in a position to integrate into modern agriculture;
Whereas to that end the Member States are therefore required under Articles 5 (1) and 6 (1) of Directive 72/161/EEC to introduce, in addition to the normal agricultural training provided in their country, measures designed to give farmers and hired and  family agricultural workers further training of a general, technical and economic nature;
Whereas under the third indent of Article 12 (2) of Directive 72/161/EEC, the Guidance Section of the EAGGF refunds to Member States 25 % of the expenditure incurred in respect of such measures, up to a maximum of 1 500 units of account for each person engaged in agriculture having completed a course of basic or advanced vocational training;
Whereas the measures provided for in Articles 55 to 61 of Law No 153 of 9 May 1975 are consistent with aim of Title II of Directive 72/161/EEC;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 (2) and (EC) No 2229/2004 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes sulphuric acid.
(3) For sulphuric acid the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 and (EC) No 2229/2004 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. For sulphuric acid the rapporteur Member State was France and all relevant information was submitted in October 2007.
(4) The Commission examined sulphuric acid in accordance with Article 24a of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. A draft review report for that substance was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 26 September 2008 in the format of the Commission review report.
(5) During the examination of this active substance by the Committee, it was concluded, taking into account comments received from Member States, that the existing evidence is not sufficient to finalise the consumer risk assessment and to set a reliable Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and such value is necessary to conduct the operator risk assessment. Moreover, other concerns which were identified by the rapporteur Member State in its assessment report are included in the review report for the substance.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing sulphuric acid satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Sulphuric acid should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing sulphuric acid are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing sulphuric acid should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing sulphuric acid remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for sulphuric acid in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (4), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.

However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing sulphuric acid satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((7)) Sulphuric acid should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((8)) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing sulphuric acid are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n\n((9)) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing sulphuric acid should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing sulphuric acid remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.\n\n((10)) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for sulphuric acid in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I(4), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nSulphuric acid shall not be included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall ensure that:\n(a)\nauthorisations for plant protection products containing sulphuric acid are withdrawn by 5 June 2009;\n(b)\nno authorisations for plant protection products containing sulphuric acid are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nAny period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 5 June 2010 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2), in conjunction with Article 4, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XVI of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167, 169 and 170 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that export refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Export refunds for the Dominican Republic have been differentiated to take into account the reduced custom duties applied on imports under the import tariff quota under the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic (2), approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC (3). Due to a changed market situation in the Dominican Republic, characterised by increased competition for milk powder, the quota is no longer fully used. In order to maximise the use of the quota, the differentiation of export refunds for the Dominican Republic should be abolished.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 187, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1239/2011 (2) opened a standing invitation to tender for the 2011/2012 marketing year for imports of sugar of CN code 1701 at a reduced customs duty.
(2) As the availability of supply on the Union sugar market has improved, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 57/2012 (3) suspended the submission of tenders for the partial invitation to tender ending on 25 January 2012, 1 February 2012 and 15 February 2012.
(3) Constant monitoring of the market revealed that availability of sugar supply in the Union has improved only moderately. Despite the increasing imports in January 2012 the pace of imports from African, Caribbean and Pacific States and Least Developed Countries decreased considerably since mid-February 2012. This analysis was confirmed by a large majority of Member States in the Management Committee of 8 March 2012 who considered that there were still supply problems that would get worse in the course of the marketing year. This could concern especially small and medium Enterprises and customers with fixed quantities in long term contracts.

Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(5), as last amended by Commission Decision 2003/42/EC(6), and in particular Article 10,
Whereas:
(1) The animal health and veterinary certification conditions for imports of fresh meat from certain African countries are laid down by Decision 1999/283/EC(7), as last amended by Decision 2002/646/EC(8).
(2) The animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for import of wild and farmed game meat and rabbit meat from third countries are laid down by Decision 2000/585/EC(9), as last amended by Decision 2002/646/EC.
(3) An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Botswana in the approved EC zone number 6 on 7 January 2003, with the initial infection on the holding detected on 23 December 2002, and the competent veterinary authority of Botswana immediately suspended exports of de-boned fresh meat of bovine, ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates to the Community from the whole of the country.
(4) The Botswanan authorities are carrying out emergency vaccination and investigations on the outbreak in order to assess the situation in the country. However, while the outcome of this assessment is not available it is not possible to regionalise Botswana to allow importation of de-boned fresh meat of bovine, ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates.
(5) In this situation, the importation of fresh meat from Botswana may constitute a risk of introducing foot-and-mouth disease in the territory of the Community. In consequence importation of de-boned fresh meat of bovine, ovine and caprine species and farmed and wild ungulates should be temporarily suspended from the previously approved zones of Botswana.
(6) However, the Botswanan authorities have provided detailed information on en route consignments of fresh meat sent to the Community, with guarantees that those consignments were produced before the date of infection. Therefore, these consignments and consignments obtained from animals slaughtered before the date of infection should be authorised for importation into the territory of the European Union.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 729/92  of 16 March 1992  imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain thermal paper originating in Japan and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty
THE COUNCIL OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission submitted after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional measures
(1) The Commission by Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain thermal paper originating in Japan and falling within CN codes ex 3703 90 90 (Taric code: 3703 90 90 * 10) and ex  4810 11 90 (Taric code: 4810 11 90 * 10). Council Regulation (EEC) No 103/92 (3) extended the duty for a period not exceeding two months.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the interested parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views on the findings.
(3) Parties were informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of a provisional duty. They  were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.
(4) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered and where appropriate, the Commission findings were modified to take account of them.
C. Product
(5) In view of observations made by the Customs administrations of certain Member States concerning problems at import clearance, the Commission re-examined the product description given in recital 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. It was found that the  expression 'thermal paper. . . destined to be used in machines . . . which print facsimiles . . .' was inadequate and should be replaced by the term 'telefax paper'. The Council supports the Commission's view.
(6) One Japanese producer reiterated the points it made prior to the imposition of provisional duties, namely that telefax paper presented in jumbo reels or coils constitutes two separate products and that its exports of coils were not causing injury to  the Community industry. The Council, however, supports the Commission's view that telefax paper in the form of jumbo reels and coils constitutes one single category of product and it confirms the conclusions of recitals 10 to 12 of Regulation (EEC) No  2805/91.
(7) During the Commission's investigation, it was found that, apart from the CN codes indicated in the notice of initiation of the proceeding (4), several other codes were also being used for imports into the Community of the product concerned.
Accordingly, the Commission services published a notice (5) advising the parties known to be concerned of the inclusion of these other CN codes in the proceeding.
There was no reaction from interested parties to this notice.
As a result also of the discussions held subsequent to the initiation of this proceeding at the level of the Customs Cooperation Council (CCC) concerning the correct classification of telefax paper, the Council of the European Communities confirms the  Commission's view that measures should also apply to all CN codes under which the product under consideration can, within the framework of existing customs legislation, be imported.
The Commission has therefore concluded that the information that it possesses and has verified constitutes a valid basis for the establishment of dumping margins, the assessment of injury and the calculation of appropriate duties for the product falling  under all the CN codes concerned.
D. Dumping
(8) In the light of its own overall net profit, one Japanese company claimed that the reasonable profit of 18 % on cost of production used for constructing normal value was too high. The profit margin for this company's profitable sales, calculated in  accordance with Article 2 (B) (3) (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, was indeed found to be less than the 18 % margin used. Accordingly, the percentage of profit used for constructing normal value for this company has, where necessary, been  reduced.
For the remaining companies, the Council considers that, in view of their profitability during the investigation period, 18 % is a reasonable profit margin for constructing normal value and confirms the conclusions set out in recitals 13 to 23 of  Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91.
No further information was received, and the Council therefore confirms that the definitive weighted average dumping margins expressed as a percentage of the cif value for each of the companies concerned are as follows:
- Jujo Paper Co., Ltd, Tokyo: 0,0 %,
- Kanzaki Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Tokyo: 10,3 %,
- Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd, Tokyo: 15,5 %,
- Tomoegawa Paper Co., Ltd, Tokyo: 24,8 %.
The Council confirms the Commission's findings with regard to the 55,3 % dumping margin calculated for the purposes of the residual duty.
E. Injury and cause of injury
(9) No new elements concerning injury were submitted to the Commission following the publication of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91. The Council therefore confirms the conclusions set out in recital 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91.
(10) As far as cause of injury is concerned, one Japanese producer claimed that the impact of its sales to the Community should be examined in isolation and deemed not to have caused injury, as the volume of its exports was small.
(11) The Commission, in accordance with the findings of the Court of Justice, considers that the Community authorities should examine the impact on the Community industry of all dumped imports taken together, even if the export volume of an individual  company is relatively low.
The Council therefore confirms the Commission's view that, for the purpose of determining injury, the exports of this company should not be treated separately from those of the other Japanese companies.
F. Community interest
(12) No new arguments concerning Community interest were brought forward, and the Council therefore confirms the Commission findings set out in Section F of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 and considers that it is in the Community's interest to impose  anti-dumping measures to eliminate the injurious effects of dumped imports originating in Japan.
G. Duty
(13) With regard to the calculation to determine the duty rate necessary to eliminate the injury being suffered by Community industry, the Commission considers that the difference between the actual selling price in the Community of the Japanese product  and a sales price which enables Community industry to achieve an 18 % profit on turnover, should be removed.
(14) For the reasons given in recital 46 of Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91, an 18 % profit margin is the minimum necessary to render possible additional investments in manufacturing facilities and research and development. Taking into account the fast  changing nature of the industry concerned and the continual need to adapt paper to suit new hardware, the Commission is of the opinion that, without this profit margin, the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry would inevitably be  exacerbated and the injury caused by dumping would remain.
(15) The Council therefore confirms the Commission findings with regard to the injury threshold established in Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91; however, as the injury correction figures calculated for the cooperating companies are higher than the dumping  margins established, it is the latter which are to be the basis for applying the duty. With regard to the residual duty, the injury correction figure was less than the dumping margin and the former will therefore be taken into account.
(16) On the basis of calculations of dumping and injury described in Regulation (EEC) No 2805/91 and the submissions subsequently received, the Council therefore concludes that duties should be imposed to eliminate the level of dumping found for Kanzaki  Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd, Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd and Tomoegawa Paper Co., Ltd. No duty should be applied to Jujo Paper Co., Ltd, which was found not to be dumping.
(17) As far as the other companies are concerned, the Council, for the reasons given in recital 49 of Regulation 2805/91, confirms that, as provided for in Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the duty to be imposed on these companies  should be based on the facts available.
(18) The Commission has noted a continuing decline in import prices and therefore considers anti-dumping duty in ad-valorem form to be inappropriate to remedy the injury caused to the Community industry. The Council agrees and concludes that a specific  duty, calculated and applied on a weight basis, would be more appropriate.
(19) Accordingly, the amount of anti-dumping duty for the product under consideration shall be ECU 1 275,15 per tonne (net weight), except when manufactured by the following companies, for whom the amount of anti-dumping duty is set out below:
- Kanzaki Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd: ECU 211,55 per tonne (net weight),
- Mitsubishi Paper Mills Ltd: ECU 395,00 per tonne (net weight),
- Tomoegawa Paper Co., Ltd: ECU 563,75 per tonne (net weight).
No anti-dumping duties should apply to goods manufactured by Jujo Paper Co., Ltd.
H. Undertaking
(20) One Japanese producer, Tomoegawa Paper Co. Ltd has offered an undertaking which is considered acceptable. The undertaking will increase the price of the products in question to a level sufficient to eliminate the dumping established by the  Commission.
Following consultations with the Member States, the undertaking was accepted by Commission Decision 92/177/EEC (6).
I. Collection of the provisional duties
(21) In view of the size of the dumping margins established and of the serious nature of the injury caused to the Community industry, the Council considers it necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty for all  companies should be collected definitively to the extent of the amount of the definitive duty imposed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/92 of 16 March 1992 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain thermal paper originating in Japan and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas to compensate for the lower farm incomes resulting from reductions in prices expressed in national currency brought about in Germany by the adaptation of agricultural conversion rates, Council Regulation (EEC) No 855/84 of 21 March 1984 on the  calculation and dismantlement of the monetary compensatory amounts applying to certain agricultural products (4), provided that, subject to certain specified conditions, a special national aid granted through the value added tax (VAT) system was  compatible with the common market; whereas the aid provisions laid down in that Regulation are not limited in time; whereas Twentieth Council Directive 85/361/EEC of 16 July 1985 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover  taxes - Common system of value added tax; derogations in connection with the special aids granted to certain farmers to compensate for the dismantlement of monetary compensatory amounts applying to certain agricultural products (5), laid down the  conditions under which VAT could be used for the grant of this special aid;
Whereas the Council, when adopting Directive 85/361/EEC, noted that the consequences of the dismantlement of monetary compensatory amounts are temporary and degressive; whereas farm incomes in Germany have recently developed in an unsatisfactory manner;  whereas the said Directive expired on 31 December 1991; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide for an income support benefit for the farm sector in Germany in 1992;
Whereas the mechanism for granting aid as laid down in Directive 85/361/EEC is production-linked; whereas the need to support incomes for 1992 temporarily could be met more appropriately by national farm support measures; whereas due account should be  taken of the farm structure in the Laender of the former German Democratic Republic; whereas the aid provided for in Council Decision 88/402/EEC of 30 June 1988 on aid to farmers in the Federal Republic of Germany (6) should be granted notwithstanding  this Decision,","{'title': '92/392/EEC: Council Decision of 30 June 1992 on temporary national compensation for farmers in Germany', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nWithout prejudice to Decision 88/402/EEC, Germany is hereby authorized to grant to farmers, from 1 January 1992 until 31 December 1992, special national aid which is not linked to prices or to production, under the following conditions:\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation 1527/2000(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3), and in particular Articles 1(2) and 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 202/2001 of 31 January 2001 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 February 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 January 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 175, 14.7.2000, p. 59.\n\n(3) OJ L 141, 24.6.1995, p. 12.\n\n(4) OJ L 145, 27.6.1968, p. 12.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 January 2001 fixing the representative prices and additional import duties to imports of molasses in the sugar sector\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food(1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/97 of 31 January 1997 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1566/1999(3), establishes maximum levels for aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin total in certain foodstuffs. Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(4), as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2375/2001(5), will repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 194/97 with effect from 5 April 2002.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 194/97 provided that the maximum levels for nuts and dried fruit to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs were to be reconsidered before 1 July 2001 in the light of advances in scientific and technological knowledge, in particular regarding the effectiveness of sorting or other treatments in reducing the aflatoxin content.
(3) In that connection, only data with regard to almonds have been submitted. The data demonstrated that through the various sorting and physical treatments the aflatoxin content of unprocessed almonds was significantly reduced in the final consumer product. However, given the variability of the data, it is difficult to assess to what extent the reduction takes place. It is appropriate therefore to maintain the current maximum levels, it being understood that they are subject to review.
(4) With regard to cereals to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) No 194/97 provided that in so far as no specific level were fixed before 1 July 2001, the levels established for cereals intended for direct consumption would apply thereafter. The reason for this was that, in the case of cereals, it cannot be excluded that sorting methods or other physical treatments can reduce the level of contamination of aflatoxins but the real effectiveness of these methods remains to be demonstrated. It was also provided that, in the absence of data justifying the fixing of a specific maximum level for unprocessed cereals, the levels of 2 Îźg/kg aflatoxin B1 and 4 Îźg/kg aflatoxin total were to apply.
(5) In that connection, only data with regard to maize have been submitted. Although continuous monitoring was performed for more than two years, only a limited number of lots were found to be contaminated. Consequently, the possibility of demonstrating the effectiveness of sorting, cleaning and other physical treatments was limited. On the basis of these limited data, it is evident that through the various sorting and physical treatments the aflatoxin content of unprocessed maize can be significantly reduced after cleaning in the final consumer product (flaking grits, other grits). The aflatoxin contamination was mainly concentrated in the screenings (waste) and to a lesser extent in maize germ, bran meal and broken maize (products for animal feed). Since the data are limited and variable, it is not possible to assess quantitatively and with certainty to what extent this reduction can be achieved. As more data are needed before drawing final conclusions, it is appropriate to extend for maize, and this for the last time, the period for which no level is set.
(6) For raw cereals other than maize, no data have been submitted and therefore the maximum levels established for cereals intended for direct human consumption should apply as from 1 July 2001 also to cereals to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.
(7) It is important that these maximum levels enter into force as soon as possible, and remain in force after Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 has replaced Regulation (EC) No 194/97. Both these Regulations should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 257/2002 of 12 February 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 194/97 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs and Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPoint 2.1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union (1), and in particular the first sentence of the first subparagraph of Article 17(3),
Whereas:
(1) On 12 November 2012, the French authorities have submitted to the Commission a programme for 2013 providing for plant health measures in the French overseas departments. That programme specifies the objectives to be achieved, the expected deliverables, the measures to be carried out, their duration and their cost with a view to a possible Union financial contribution.
(2) The measures provided for in that programme fulfil the requirements of Commission Decision 2007/609/EC of 10 September 2007 on the definition of the measures eligible for Community financing in the programmes for the control of organisms harmful to plants and plant products in the French overseas departments, in the Azores and in Madeira (2).
(3) The measures laid down in the programme have been assessed by the Commission and discussed in the Standing Committee on Plant Health of 22-23 November 2012. A revised financial table was provided on 15 February 2013. As a result thereof, the Commission considers that that programme and its objectives meet the requirements of Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.
(4) In accordance with Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006, an appropriate maximum to the Union financial contribution should be set, and payment should be made on the basis of documentation provided by France.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (3), Union financial contributions to plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For the purposes of financial control of those measures Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation apply.
(6) In accordance with Article 75 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (4) and Article 90(1) of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated, setting out the essential elements of the action involving the expenditure.
(7) The programme submitted by the French authorities on 12 November 2012 and the measures provided for concern the calendar year 2013. Article 112 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 provides that a grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun only where the applicant can demonstrate the need to start the action before the grant is awarded.

Whereas:
(1) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 provides for a ceiling for the expenditure to be financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (‘the Union contribution’) in relation to the aid referred to in Article 103a(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and sets up a notification system, under which the Member States concerned inform the Commission of the financial implications of provisionally accepted recognition plans.
(2) The second subparagraph of Article 47(4) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 requires the Commission to set allocation coefficients on the basis of notifications made by the Member State in accordance with Article 38(4) of that Implementing Regulation and to establish the total available Union contribution per Member State per year.
(3) By Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 780/2012 (3) the amounts available for 2012 and 2013 have been fully allocated, and the amounts for 2014 to 2017 have been partially allocated.
(4) On the basis of the information notified by some Member States referred to in Article 125e of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 by 1 July 2013, in accordance with Article 38(4) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011, it appears that, for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016, the total amount of the Union contribution claimed has exceeded the maximum amount laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 47(4) of that Implementing Regulation and that, for the years 2017 and 2018, the total amount claimed has not reached that maximum amount. Accordingly, in relation to those Member States an allocation coefficient lower than 100 % has to be set for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 and an allocation coefficient of 100 % for the years 2017 and 2018.

Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

amending Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards maximum levels for arsenic, cadmium, lead, nitrites, volatile mustard oil and harmful botanical impurities
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (1), and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/32/EC provides that the use of products intended for animal feed which contain levels of undesirable substances exceeding the maximum levels laid down in Annex I to that Directive is prohibited.
(2) Certain long-term supply formulations of complementary feed for particular nutritional purposes with a high concentration of trace elements unavoidably contain amounts of arsenic, cadmium or lead exceeding the maximum levels established for these heavy metals in complementary feed. Higher maximum levels for these heavy metals in long-term supply formulations do not, however, entail a risk for animal or public health or the environment as the exposure of the animals to the heavy metals by making use of these specific long-term supply formulations is significantly lower than in the case of other complementary feeds containing trace elements. Therefore it is appropriate to establish higher maximum levels for those heavy metals for such long-term supply formulations, containing high levels of trace elements.
(3) Data have been received indicating that the level of arsenic in the feed additive ferrous carbonate following change of area of production exceeds in certain cases the current maximum level. In order to guarantee the supply of ferrous carbonate on the European market it is appropriate to increase the maximum level of arsenic in ferrous carbonate. This increase does not adversely affect the animal and public health or the environment as the maximum level established for arsenic in complementary feed and complete feed remain unchanged.
(4) Recently, a significant difference has been identified by the European Union Reference Laboratory for heavy metals in feed and food (EURL–HM) between the analytical results obtained by the application of different extraction methods currently used for the determination of lead in kaolinitic clay and feed containing kaolinitic clay (2). Before, no significant differences were observed between the levels of heavy metals in mineral feed by the application of different extraction methods (3). The maximum levels of heavy metals in feed relate ‘to an analytical determination of lead, whereby extraction is performed in nitric acid (5 % w/w) for 30 minutes at boiling temperature’. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the use of that method of extraction for the determination of lead in kaolinitic clay.
(5) As regards nitrite, for products and by-products from sugar beet and sugarcane and from the starch production no maximum level applies for the time being. In the light of developments in scientific and technical knowledge the same should apply to products and by-products from alcoholic drink production.
(6) In the light of developments in scientific and technical knowledge it is appropriate to establish the maximum level for volatile mustard oil in Camelina sativa and derived products to the same level as the maximum level for rapeseed cakes.
(7) The Brassica species have been listed under harmful botanical impurities because of their high volatile mustard oil (expressed as allyl isothiocyanates) content. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded in its opinion on glucosinolates (allyl isothiocyanates) as undesirable substances in animal feed (4) that adverse effects in animals have been generally correlated to the amount of total glucosinolates in the diet. If the amount of total glucosinolates is measured, impurities caused by the presence of products from Brassica juncea ssp., Brassica nigra and Brassica carinata, would be detected as well. It is therefore appropriate to delete the products, with the exception of the seeds, of these species from Section VI of Annex I on harmful botanical impurities and to establish for feed materials derived from these Brassica species the same maximum level for volatile mustard oil as the maximum level for rapeseed cakes.
(8) It is appropriate to use the denomination for feed materials as provided for in Commission Regulation (EU) No 68/2013 of 16 January 2013 on the catalogue of feed materials (5).
(9) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Commission Directive 92/76/EEC of 6 October 1992 recognizing protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community (3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas under Commission Directive 92/76/EEC certain zones in the Community were recognized as 'protected zones` in respect of certain harmful organisms for a period expiring on 1 July 1995;
Whereas, based on recent new information provided by Greece, Italy and France, it appears that it is no longer appropriate to maintain the 'protected zones` recognized for these countries in respect of, for Greece, Ips sexdentatus Boerner, for Italy, Anthonomus grandis (Boh.) and Glomerella gossypii Edgerton, and for France, Cephalcia lariciphila (Klug.) and Gilpinia hercyniae (Hartig), because these organisms seem to be present locally;
Whereas, also from new information provided by France and Portugal, it appears that the extent of the 'protected zones` recognized for these countries should be amended in respect of, for France, Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al., and for Portugal, Bemisia tabaci Genn.

Morelet, Hypoxylon mammatum (Wahl.) J. Miller and Pissodes spp. (European) and for Portugal in respect of Dendroctonus micans Kugelan, Ips amitinus Eichhof, Ips cembrae Heer, Ips duplicatus Sahlberg and Ips typographus Heer should be modified to take account of the concern in relation to the relevant host plants of these organisms;
Whereas from new information supplied by Sweden and Finland the area of protected zone recognized for Sweden in respect of Leptionotarsa decemlineata Say should be extended and a protected zone should be recognized for Finland in respect of Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say;
Whereas furthermore the recognition of 'protected zones` was provisional until the results of appropriate surveys monitored by Commission experts confirmed that one or more of the harmful organisms in respect of which the zones were recognized as protected zones were not endemic or established in those zones in accordance with Article 2 (1) (h) of Council Directive 77/93/EEC;
Whereas for certain protected zones further developments on the harmful organisms concerned and their respective surveys have occurred; whereas it is, therefore, appropriate to extend the provisional recognition for a further period to enable information on the developments to be evaluated by the said Commission experts;

(3) If information on sugar of the standard quality is to be comparable, the price increases or reductions fixed pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 784/68 must be added to or deducted from the offers taken into consideration in the case of white sugar. In the case of raw sugar, the corrective factors provided for in Article 5(1)(b) must be applied.

(4) Through the protection of such plants against such harmful organisms, not only should productive capacity be maintained but also agricultural productivity increased.
(5) Protective measures to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into individual Member States would have only a limited effect if such organisms were not controlled simultaneously and methodically throughout the Community and were not prevented from spreading.
(6) One of the organisms most harmful to woody dicotyledonous plants is San José Scale (Quadraspidiotus perniciosus Comst.).
(7) This pest has occurred in several Member States and there are contaminated areas within the Community.
(8) There is a permanent risk to the cultivation of woody dicotyledonous plants throughout the Community if effective measures are not taken to control this pest and prevent it from spreading.
(9) To eradicate this pest, minimum provisions should be adopted for the Community. Member States should be able to adopt additional or stricter provisions where necessary.

(2) Whereas the European Council, in particular in the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment stresses the economic importance of the audiovisual sector and the Bangemann Group report, entitled ""Europe and the global information society - recommendations to the European Council"", recognises the strategic importance of the audiovisual programme industry;
(3) Whereas a reliable information infrastructure must be organised by means of individual statistical actions;
(4) Whereas Council Decision 93/464/EEC of 22 July 1993 on a framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information 1993 to 1997(2) specified that the audiovisual sector should be regarded as one of the priority service sectors at Community level and provided for the establishment of a new information system based on the ""enterprise"" approach and functional statistics;

(6) Whereas these pilot studies should be reviewed to ensure they meet user requirements; whereas this should be undertaken within two and a half years; whereas the results of this review should be communicated to the European Parliament and the Council; whereas at all stages additional burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should be minimised;
(7) Whereas individual statistical actions are governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics(4);
(8) Whereas, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, the objective of the proposed individual statistical actions can be achieved only by a Community legal instrument, as only the Commission is in a position to coordinate the requisite harmonisation of information at Community level;

Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

Whereas, pursuant to Articles 1 and 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 3897/89 suspension of customs duties in the context of preferential tariff ceilings is granted within the limits of the individual ceilings set out in column 8 of Annex I to that Regulation in respect of each of the categories of product under consideration; whereas as provided for in the third paragraph of Article 12 of the said Regulation, the Commission may, after 31 December 1990, take measures to stop quantities being charged against any particular preferential tariff limit if these limits were exceeded particularly as a result of regularizations of imports actually made during the preferential tariff period;
Whereas, in respect of the products of category 28 (order No 40.0280) originating in Thailand and Pakistan, and of category 97 (order No 40.0970) originating in China, the relevant ceilings were fixed at 104 000 pieces and four tonnes, respectively; whereas on 1 January 1991, the sum of the quantities charged during the 1990 preferential period has exceeded the ceilings in question;
Whereas it appears desirable to take measures to stop quantities being charged against the said ceilings in respect of Thailand and Pakistan for category 28, and in respect of China for category 97;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (1), and in particular Article 8(1), the first subparagraph of Article 10(2), Article 10(3) and Article 11(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex I to Commission Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU (2) sets out a list of third countries or parts thereof from which Member States are to authorise imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (‘semen’). New Zealand is included in that list. In addition, in Section A of Part 1 of Annex II to that Implementing Decision the model animal health certificate for imports into and transits through the Union of semen dispatched from the semen collection centre where the semen was collected is set out.
(2) Council Directive 64/432/EEC (3) lays down rules for intra-Union trade in bovine animals and provides for the monitoring and eradication programmes for certain diseases affecting those animals, including tuberculosis. New Zealand has requested for the recognition of its bovine tuberculosis control programme as being equivalent to the monitoring and eradication programmes for bovine tuberculosis that are implemented by the Member States in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC. The information provided by New Zealand on its bovine tuberculosis control programme demonstrates that the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd classified as ‘C2’, under the National Pest Management Strategy for bovine tuberculosis of New Zealand, is equivalent to the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd that is recognised in a Member State as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’ in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC.
(3) Therefore, the list of third countries or parts thereof from which Member States are to authorise imports of semen set out in Annex I and the model animal health certificate set out in Section A of Part 1 of Annex II to Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU should be amended in order to reflect the special conditions by which the Union recognises the equivalence of the classification of bovine herds as ‘C2’ within the framework of the bovine tuberculosis control programme implemented in New Zealand with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC for a bovine herd in a Member State recognised as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’.
(4) To further reduce administrative burdens for the centre veterinarian and for the official veterinarian, it is appropriate to remove information on the total quantity of the straws of semen in the consignment from point I.28. of the model animal health certificate set out in Section A of Part 1 of Annex II to Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU as this information is already stated in point I.20. of that model animal health certificate.
(5) In addition, it is necessary to insert in the table in point I.28. of the model animal health certificate set out in Section A of Part 1 of Annex II to Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU a column where information can be specified as regards the quantity of straws of semen collected on a particular date from an identified donor bull complying with particular conditions for bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease.
(6) Annexes I and II to Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) To avoid any disruption of imports into the Union of consignments of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species, the use of animal health certificates issued in accordance with Section A of Part 1 of Annex II to Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU in their version before the entry into force of this Decision should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Community supplies of certain fishery products currently depend on imports from third countries. It is in the Community's interest to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume. In order not to jeopardise the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market.
(2) It is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up.
(3) The decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community. To ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly.
(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.
(5) Examination of the situation as regards supplies of tropical shrimps and prawns from South and Central America (shrimp and prawns of the genus Penaeus, except the species Penaeus monodon and Penaeus japonicus) to the Community market has shown that, mainly due to the ""white spot syndrome"" affecting the species, the user industries are temporarily no longer receiving sufficient supplies.

Having regard to Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 September 2003 on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease repealing Directive 85/511/EEC and Decisions 89/531/EEC and 91/665/EEC and amending Directive 92/46/EEC (1), and in particular Article 67 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/85/EC sets out minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and certain preventive measures aimed at increasing the awareness and preparedness of the competent authorities and the farming community concerning that disease.
(2) Those preventive measures include an obligation on Member States to ensure that the handling of live foot-and-mouth disease virus for research and diagnosis is carried out only in the approved laboratories listed in Part A and the manufacturing of either inactivated antigens for the production of vaccines or vaccines and related research is carried out only in the approved establishments and laboratories listed in Part B of Annex XI to Directive 2003/85/EC.
(3) Bulgaria has officially informed the Commission that following the checks carried out in accordance with Article 66 of Directive 2003/85/EC, their national reference laboratory is no longer considered to meet the bio-security standards provided for in Article 65(d) of Directive 2003/85/EC.
(4) The Netherlands have officially informed the Commission of certain changes relating to the name of a laboratory listed in Part B of Annex XI to Directive 2003/85/EC situated in the Netherlands.
(5) For security reasons, it is important to keep the list of laboratories set out in Annex XI to Directive 2003/85/EC updated.
(6) Accordingly, it is necessary to delete the entry for Bulgaria in the list of laboratories set out in Part A and to replace the entry for the Netherlands in the list of laboratories set out in Part B of Annex XI to Directive 2003/85/EC. Annex XI to Directive 2003/85/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '24.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 379/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2226/2004\nof 23 December 2004\nfixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation.

Realising that the relief regarding restatement of comparative disclosures in IFRS 7 concerning fair value measurements and liquidity risk if those comparative periods end before 31 December 2009 is not available to entities that apply IFRS for the first time, the aim of the amendment to IFRS 1 is to provide for an optional relief for those entities.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular Article 39(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) With a view to supplying Community refineries, Article 39(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides for imports of raw cane sugar at a reduced rate of duty in accordance with the agreements concluded with certain supplier countries and subject to the conditions laid down therein. These sugars are called ""special preferential sugar"".
(2) The quantities imported under these conditions are intended to cover the Member States' presumed maximum supply needs, as fixed in Article 39(2), that cannot be met by alternative supplies of raw sugar for refining.
(3) A forecast supply balance for the 2001/02 marketing year indicates such a need that is not covered. This supply shortfall is being felt notably in the Member States listed in the said Article 39(2) and in which sugar refinery activity depends to a great extent on imports of these special preferential sugars. In view of the staggered production of other available sugars and the fixing of contracts relating thereto, an alternative source of supply is not feasible. In the absence of an agreement with the ACP countries, a break in supply to these Member States is thus inevitable.
(4) The agreements on imports of special preferential cane sugar, applicable in the 1995/96 to 2000/01 marketing years, expired on 30 June 2001. Negotiation of the agreements to cover the period referred to in Article 38(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 has not yet begun. In order to avoid a break in supply to refineries in certain Community regions, in accordance with the Council invitation and having consulted the supplier countries concerned, imports of cane sugar should be authorised under the conditions applying until 30 June 2001 in those Community regions where a supply need has been noted in the forecast supply balance. This measure should cover the supply needs of Portugal and Finland for three months. So as not to prejudice the negotiations mentioned above, provision should currently be made only for sugar of ACP origin.
(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 407/2001 of 28 February 2001 opening a preferential tariff quota in respect of imports of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States for supply to refineries in the period 1 March to 30 June 2001(2) should apply for the purposes of fixing the import duty and the minimum purchase price.
(6) The rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1916/95 of 2 August 1995 laying down detailed rules for application for the importation under preferential agreements on tariff quotas of raw cane sugar for refining(3) should apply to the tariff quota opened by this Decision.
(7) This measure adopted by this Decision applies irrespective of any decisions taken subsequently by the Council as regards the agreements covering the period 2001-06, including any adjustments applicable from 1 July 2001.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': '2001/656/EC: Commission Decision of 3 August 2001 laying down provisional measures for imports into Portugal and Finland of special raw cane sugar for refining at the start of the 2001/02 marketing year (notified under document number C(2001) 2479)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from the one specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, that amount has to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as, in the present case, long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake. On 8 December 2005, the Commission adopted Decision 2005/880/EC (2) allowing the Netherlands the application of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland.
(2) The derogation thus granted concerned approximately 25 000 farms in the Netherlands and approximately 900 000 hectares and applied to the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009. The derogation was granted because:
(a) the Dutch legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC included application standards both for nitrogen and phosphate and application standards related to phosphate aimed to achieve an equilibrium in phosphate fertilisation by 2015;
(b) the Netherlands addressed the issue of nutrient surplus from manure and mineral fertilisers through several policy instruments and in the period 1992 to 2002 decreased cattle numbers by 17 %, pigs by 14 % and sheep and goats by 21 %. Nitrogen and phosphorus in manure decreased respectively by 29 and 34 % in the period 1985 to 2002. Nitrogen and phosphorus surpluses decreased respectively by 25 and 37 %, in the period 1992 to 2002;
(c) the available water quality data showed a downwards trend in groundwater nitrate concentration and in nutrient concentration (including phosphorus) in surface water;
(d) the technical and scientific documents presented in the Dutch notification showed that the proposed amount of 250 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from cattle manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland was compatible with the achievement of the level of 11,3 mg/l N (corresponding to 50 mg/l NO3) in water in all soil types, and to approximately a zero phosphorus surplus, under conditions of optimal management;
(e) the technical and scientific documents presented showed that the proposed amount of 250 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from cattle manure in farms with at least 70 % grassland was justified on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing season and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(3) The Commission considered therefore that the amount of manure requested by the Netherlands would not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met. These conditions included the establishment of fertiliser plans on a farm by farm basis, the recording of fertiliser practices through fertiliser accounts, periodic soil analysis, green cover in winter after maize, specific provisions on grass ploughing, no manure application before grass ploughing and adjustment of fertilisation to take into account the contribution of leguminous crops. These provisions were aimed at ensuring fertilisation based on crop needs and reduction and prevention of nitrogen losses to water.
(4) In order to avoid that the application of the 2006-2009 derogation granted by Decision 2005/880/EC would lead to intensification, the competent authorities were compelled to ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus would not increase beyond the level of the year 2002 in accordance with the Dutch third national action programme.
(5) The Netherlands have communicated the maps and reports referred to in Article 8 and Article 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC in time.
(6) On 14 July 2009 the Netherlands submitted to the Commission a request for an extension of the derogation. The request referred to a detailed justification and to the approval of fourth Nitrates Action Programme (2010-2013) by the Dutch House of Representatives. This fourth action programme indicates the (considerable) progress made in line with the conditions of the 2006-2009 derogation and the challenges ahead. It builds further on the third action programme and contains reinforced measures including stricter nitrogen application standards on sandy soils; stricter phosphorus application standards based on the soil phosphorus status and longer closed periods for land application of fertilisers (3). These legal measures aim at a further reduction of nutrient surplus and further improvement of water quality, if need be by further reinforced action beyond the period 2010-2013.
(7) Water quality shows a further downward trend in groundwater nitrate concentration and in nutrient concentration (including phosphorus) in surface water with main effects of the third action programme still to be expected in the upcoming years.
(8) Results of monitoring and controls show that, in the period 2006-2009 approximately 24 000 grassland farms corresponding to approximately 830 000 ha of cultivated land were encompassed by the derogation.
(9) In order to avoid that the application of the requested derogation leads to intensification, the competent authorities should continue to ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus does not increase the level of the year 2002.
(10) The results achieved so far by the Netherlands are in line with the conditions set out in Decision 2005/880/EC.
(11) The necessary legal framework for implementing Directive 91/676/EEC and executing the fourth action programme has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.
(12) Given the measures the Netherlands have committed themselves to in the action programme for the period 2010-2013 the Commission considers that the amount of manure requested by the Netherlands for the period 2010-2013 would not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC if the same strict conditions established by Decision 2005/880/EC are met.
(13) Decision 2005/880/EC expires on 31 December 2009.
(14) For the purpose of ensuring that the cattle farms concerned may continue to benefit from a derogation, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2005/880/EC to 31 December 2013 under the same conditions as those set out in articles 4 to 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC.
(15) The deadline for reporting to the Commission, set by Article 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC, should however be adapted and aligned with the deadline for reporting obligations under article 8 of Decision 2005/880/EC.
(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,","{'header': '6.2.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 35/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 5 February 2010\namending Decision 2005/880/EC granting a derogation requested by the Netherlands pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources\n(notified under document C(2010) 606)\n(Only the Dutch version is authentic)\n(2010/65/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from the one specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, that amount has to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as, in the present case, long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\xa0On 8 December 2005, the Commission adopted Decision 2005/880/EC(2)allowing the Netherlands the application of 250\xa0kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure in farms with at least 70\xa0% grassland.\n\n((2)) The derogation thus granted concerned approximately 25\xa0000 farms in the Netherlands and approximately 900\xa0000 hectares and applied to the period 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2009.

These provisions were aimed at ensuring fertilisation based on crop needs and reduction and prevention of nitrogen losses to water.\n\n((4)) In order to avoid that the application of the 2006-2009 derogation granted by Decision 2005/880/EC would lead to intensification, the competent authorities were compelled to ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus would not increase beyond the level of the year 2002 in accordance with the Dutch third national action programme.\n\n((5)) The Netherlands have communicated the maps and reports referred to in Article 8 and Article 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC in time.\n\n((6)) On 14 July 2009 the Netherlands submitted to the Commission a request for an extension of the derogation. The request referred to a detailed justification and to the approval of fourth Nitrates Action Programme (2010-2013) by the Dutch House of Representatives. This fourth action programme indicates the (considerable) progress made in line with the conditions of the 2006-2009 derogation and the challenges ahead. It builds further on the third action programme and contains reinforced measures including stricter nitrogen application standards on sandy soils; stricter phosphorus application standards based on the soil phosphorus status and longer closed periods for land application of fertilisers(3). These legal measures aim at a further reduction of nutrient surplus and further improvement of water quality, if need be by further reinforced action beyond the period 2010-2013.\n\n((7)) Water quality shows a further downward trend in groundwater nitrate concentration and in nutrient concentration (including phosphorus) in surface water with main effects of the third action programme still to be expected in the upcoming years.\n\n((8)) Results of monitoring and controls show that, in the period 2006-2009 approximately 24\xa0000 grassland farms corresponding to approximately 830\xa0000 ha of cultivated land were encompassed by the derogation.\n\n((9)) In order to avoid that the application of the requested derogation leads to intensification, the competent authorities should continue to ensure that manure production both in terms of nitrogen and phosphorus does not increase the level of the year 2002.\n\n((10)) The results achieved so far by the Netherlands are in line with the conditions set out in Decision 2005/880/EC.\n\n((11)) The necessary legal framework for implementing Directive 91/676/EEC and executing the fourth action programme has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.\n\n((12)) Given the measures the Netherlands have committed themselves to in the action programme for the period 2010-2013 the Commission considers that the amount of manure requested by the Netherlands for the period 2010-2013 would not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC if the same strict conditions established by Decision 2005/880/EC are met.\n\n((13)) Decision 2005/880/EC expires on 31 December 2009.\n\n((14)) For the purpose of ensuring that the cattle farms concerned may continue to benefit from a derogation, it is appropriate to extend the validity of Decision 2005/880/EC to 31 December 2013 under the same conditions as those set out in articles 4 to 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC.\n\n((15)) The deadline for reporting to the Commission, set by Article 10 of Decision 2005/880/EC, should however be adapted and aligned with the deadline for reporting obligations under article 8 of Decision 2005/880/EC.\n\n((16)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Application', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2005/880/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 1\nThe derogation requested by the Netherlands by letter of 8 April 2005 and the extension requested by letter of 14 July 2009, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted.’\n2.\nArticle 10, paragraph 1, second subparagraph is replaced by the following:\n‘The report shall be transmitted to the Commission annually in the second quarter of the year following the year of activity.’\n3.\nArticle 11 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 11\nApplication\nThis Decision shall apply until 31 December 2013 in the context of the fourth Dutch Nitrates Action Programme.’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of The Netherlands.'}]}"

(notified under document C(2012) 8234)
(2013/30/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (1) and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Black Sea biogeographical region referred to in Article 1(c)(iii) of Directive 92/43/EEC comprises parts of the Union territories of Bulgaria and Romania, as specified in the biogeographical map approved on 20 April 2005 by the Committee set up by Article 20 of that Directive, hereinafter the ‘Habitats Committee’.
(2) It is necessary in the context of a process which was initiated in 1995 to make further progress in the actual establishment of the Natura 2000 network, which is an essential element of the protection of biodiversity in the Union.
(3) The initial list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region, within the meaning of Directive 92/43/EEC, was adopted by Commission Decision 2009/92/EC (2). On the basis of Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC, the Member State concerned has to designate the sites included in the list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region as special areas of conservation as soon as possible and within six years at most, establishing conservation priorities and the necessary conservation measures.
(4) In the context of a dynamic adaptation of the Natura 2000 network, the lists of sites of Community importance are reviewed. An update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region is therefore necessary.
(5) On the one hand, the update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region is necessary in order to include additional sites that have been proposed since 2010 by Member States as sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 92/43/EEC. For these additional sites, the obligations resulting from Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC should apply as soon as possible and within six years at most from the adoption of this Decision.
(6) On the other hand, the update of the list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region is necessary in order to reflect any changes in site-related information submitted by Member States following the adoption of the initial Union list. In that sense, this updated list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region constitutes a consolidated version of the list of sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region. It should be stressed that, for any site included in this Decision, the obligations resulting from Articles 4(4) and 6(1) of Directive 92/43/EEC should apply as soon as possible and within six years at most from the adoption of the list of sites of Community importance in which the site was included for the first time.
(7) For the Black Sea biogeographical region, lists of sites proposed as sites of Community importance within the meaning of Article 1 of Directive 92/43/EEC were transmitted to the Commission between March 2007 and October 2011, in accordance with Article 4(1) of that Directive 92/43/EEC.
(8) The lists of proposed sites were accompanied by information on each site, supplied in the format established by Commission Decision 97/266/EC of 18 December 1996 concerning a site information format for proposed Natura 2000 sites (3).
(9) That information includes the map of the site transmitted by the Member States concerned, name, location and extent of the site, and the data yielded by application of the criteria specified in Annex III to Directive 92/43/EEC.
(10) On the basis of the draft list drawn up by the Commission in agreement with each of the Member States concerned, which also identifies sites hosting priority natural habitat types or priority species, an updated list of sites selected as sites of Community importance for the Black Sea biogeographical region should be adopted.
(11) Knowledge of the existence and distribution of the natural habitat types and species is constantly evolving as a result of the surveillance undertaken in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 92/43/EEC. Therefore, the evaluation and selection of sites at Union level was done using the best available information at present.
(12) Certain Member States concerned have not proposed sufficient sites to meet the requirements of Directive 92/43/EEC for certain habitat types and species. For those habitat types and species it can therefore not be concluded that the Natura 2000 network is complete. Taking into account the delay in receiving the information and reaching agreement with the Member States, it is necessary to adopt an updated list of sites, which will need to be reviewed in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.
(13) Given that knowledge on the existence and distribution of some of the natural habitat types of Annex I and species of Annex II to Directive 92/43/EEC remains incomplete, it should not be concluded that the network is either complete or incomplete. The list should be reviewed, if necessary, in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 92/43/EEC.
(14) In the interests of clarity and transparency, Decision 2009/92/EC should be repealed.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (1), and in particular Article 145(c), (m) and (n) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 44(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 provided that farmers had to keep at their disposal for a period of at least 10 months the parcels corresponding to the eligible hectares. Council Regulation (EC) No 146/2008 of 14 February 2008 amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), amended Article 44(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 to empower the Member States to set the date when the parcels should be at the farmers’ disposal. Following this change, the detailed provisions contained in Article 24(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 (2) on the implementation of the requirement for farmers to keep the parcels at their disposal for at least 10 months are no longer needed. Article 24(2) of that Regulation should therefore be deleted. In addition, Article 26(2) of that Regulation needs to be adapted accordingly.
(2) Furthermore, following the amendments of the rules of cross-compliance introduced by Articles 1(1) and 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 146/2008, Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 (3) needs to be adapted.
(3) Rules which in certain cases require a follow up by the competent authority that a remedial action has been taken by the farmers have been introduced. In order to avoid any weakening of the control system, in particular as to the samples for on-the-spot checks, it should be clarified that such follow up cases should not be taken into account when establishing the minimum control sample.
(4) Furthermore, where the possibility not to apply any reduction for minor non-compliances or not to apply reductions amounting to EUR 100 or less, as provided for in Articles 6(3) or 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, is applied by a Member State, rules should be established where farmers fail to undertake the remedial action required from them.
(5) Regulations (EC) No 795/2004 and (EC) No 796/2004 should be amended accordingly.
(6) The introduction of the possibility not to apply any reduction for minor non-compliances or not to apply reductions amounting to EUR 100 or less is applicable as of 1 January 2008. Hence, amendments provided for in this Regulation should concern aid applications relating to years or premium periods starting as of 1 January 2008. This Regulation should therefore apply as of 1 January 2008. However, the new provisions concerning the liability of farmers in respect of non-compliance in case of transfer of land apply from 1 April 2008. Therefore, the corresponding amendment of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 should also apply from that date.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1975/2006 of 7 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, as regards the implementation of control procedures as well as cross-compliance in respect of rural development support measures (4) contains a reference to a provision of Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 which should be deleted by the present Regulation. For the sake of legal certainty, it is appropriate to clarify that the said provision remains valid for the purposes of applying Regulation (EC) No 1975/2006, until a later decision is taken through the appropriate legislative procedure.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 4(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs (2) lays down microbiological criteria for certain micro-organisms and the implementing rules that are to be complied with by food business operators when implementing the general and specific hygiene measures referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. In particular, it provides for food safety criteria for histamine and sampling plans for fishery products from fish species associated with high amount of histidine.
(2) Fish sauce produced by fermentation is a liquid fishery product. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (3) has fixed new recommended maximum levels of histamine in such fish sauce which are different from the ones set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005. That recommendation is in line with the information on consumer exposure data presented by the European Food Safety Authority (‘EFSA’) in its Scientific Opinion on risk based control of biogenic amine formation in fermented foods (4).
(3) Since fish sauce is a liquid fishery product histamine can be expected to be evenly distributed. The sampling plan can therefore be more simple than for fishery products occurring in another form.
(4) It is appropriate to establish a separate food safety criterion for fish sauce produced by fermentation of fishery products in order to align the criterion with the new Codex Alimentarius standard and the EFSA opinion. Footnote 2 should also be amended.
(5) The normal sampling plan for histamine from fishery products consists of nine samples which require much sample material. Footnote 18 to food safety criterion 1.26 for fishery products states that single samples may be taken at retail level. In such cases the whole batch should not be deemed unsafe based only on the result of one sample. However, if one of nine samples analysed is found to be above M the whole batch shall be deemed unsafe. This should also be the case when single samples are found to be above M. Consequently, is is appropriate to amend footnote 18. Footnote 18 should also be applied to both food safety criteria 1.26 and 1.27.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '24.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 282/46', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1019/2013\nof 23 October 2013\namending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 as regards histamine in fishery products\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs(2)lays down microbiological criteria for certain micro-organisms and the implementing rules that are to be complied with by food business operators when implementing the general and specific hygiene measures referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.

of 8 July 2008
in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009
(2008/608/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 122(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the report from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the report from the European Central Bank (2),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (3),
Having regard to the discussion of the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government,
Whereas:
(1) The third stage of economic and monetary union (hereinafter referred to as ‘EMU’) started on 1 January 1999. By Decision 98/317/EC (4), the Council, meeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or Government, found that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 1999.
(2) By Decision 2000/427/EC (5) the Council decided that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2001. By Decision 2006/495/EC (6) the Council decided that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2007. By Decisions 2007/503/EC (7) and 2007/504/EC (8) the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2008.
(3) In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty, the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.
(4) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession, Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.
(5) The European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘ECB’) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange-rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997 (9). The procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (10).
(6) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. The most recent Commission and ECB regular Convergence Reports were adopted in May 2008. Slovakia submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment on 4 April 2008.
(7) National legislation in the Member States including the statutes of national central banks is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘Statute of the ESCB’). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Slovakia with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
(8) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion concerning price stability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices (11). In order to assess the price stability criterion a Member State’s inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one-year period ending in March 2008, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability were Malta, the Netherlands and Denmark, with inflation rates of, respectively 1,5 percent, 1,7 percent and 2,0 percent. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2008 was 3,2 percent.
(9) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.
(10) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against any other Member State’s currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange-rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending on 18 April 2008.
(11) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria concerning the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2008 was 6,5 percent.
(12) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria are to be provided by the Commission. For the preparation of this decision the Commission provided data. Budgetary data were provided by the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 April 2008 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (12).
(13) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfilment by Slovakia of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, the Commission concluded that:
— in Slovakia, national legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB,
— regarding the fulfilment by Slovakia of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 121(1) of the Treaty:
— the average inflation rate in Slovakia in the year ending March 2008 stood at 2,2 percent, which is well below the reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead, albeit with a narrowing margin,
— the budget deficit in Slovakia has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 percent of GDP; the Commission therefore recommended to the Council to abrogate Decision 2005/182/EC of 5 July 2004 on the existence of an excessive deficit for Slovakia (13),
— Slovakia has been a member of ERM II since 28 November 2005; in the two-year period ending 18 April 2008, the Slovak koruna (SKK) has not been subject to severe tensions and Slovakia has not devalued, on its own initiative, the SKK bilateral central rate against the euro,
— in the year ending March 2008, the long-term interest rate in Slovakia was, on average, 4,5 percent which is below the reference value.
(14) By Decision 2008/562/EC (14) the Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, abrogated Decision 2005/182/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Slovakia.
(15) According to Article 122(2) of the Treaty the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal by the Commission, is to decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,","{'header': '24.7.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 195/24', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 8 July 2008\nin accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Slovakia of the single currency on 1 January 2009\n(2008/608/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The third stage of economic and monetary union (hereinafter referred to as ‘EMU’) started on 1 January 1999.

By Decisions 2007/503/EC(7)and 2007/504/EC(8)the Council decided that Cyprus and Malta fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2008.\n\n((3)) In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty, the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.\n\n((4)) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession, Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.\n\n((5)) The European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘ECB’) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange-rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997(9). The procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union(10).\n\n((6)) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. The most recent Commission and ECB regular Convergence Reports were adopted in May 2008. Slovakia submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment on 4 April 2008.\n\n((7)) National legislation in the Member States including the statutes of national central banks is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘Statute of the ESCB’). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Slovakia with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.\n\n((8)) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion concerning price stability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(11). In order to assess the price stability criterion a Member State’s inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one-year period ending in March 2008, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability were Malta, the Netherlands and Denmark, with inflation rates of, respectively 1,5 percent, 1,7 percent and 2,0 percent. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2008 was 3,2 percent.\n\n((9)) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.\n\n((10)) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against any other Member State’s currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange-rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending on 18 April 2008.\n\n((11)) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion concerning the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria concerning the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2008 was 6,5 percent.\n\n((12)) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria are to be provided by the Commission. For the preparation of this decision the Commission provided data. Budgetary data were provided by the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 April 2008 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(12).\n\n((13)) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfilment by Slovakia of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, the Commission concluded that:—in Slovakia, national legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB,—regarding the fulfilment by Slovakia of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 121(1) of the Treaty:—the average inflation rate in Slovakia in the year ending March 2008 stood at 2,2 percent, which is well below the reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead, albeit with a narrowing margin,—the budget deficit in Slovakia has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 percent of GDP; the Commission therefore recommended to the Council to abrogate Decision 2005/182/EC of 5 July 2004 on the existence of an excessive deficit for Slovakia(13),—Slovakia has been a member of ERM II since 28 November 2005; in the two-year period ending 18 April 2008, the Slovak koruna (SKK) has not been subject to severe tensions and Slovakia has not devalued, on its own initiative, the SKK bilateral central rate against the euro,—in the year ending March 2008, the long-term interest rate in Slovakia was, on average, 4,5 percent which is below the reference value.In the light of the assessment on legal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the convergence criteria as well as the additional factors, and provided that Decision 2005/182/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit is abrogated by the Council, Slovakia fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.\n\n(—) in Slovakia, national legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB,\n\n(—) regarding the fulfilment by Slovakia of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 121(1) of the Treaty:—the average inflation rate in Slovakia in the year ending March 2008 stood at 2,2 percent, which is well below the reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead, albeit with a narrowing margin,—the budget deficit in Slovakia has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 percent of GDP; the Commission therefore recommended to the Council to abrogate Decision 2005/182/EC of 5 July 2004 on the existence of an excessive deficit for Slovakia(13),—Slovakia has been a member of ERM II since 28 November 2005; in the two-year period ending 18 April 2008, the Slovak koruna (SKK) has not been subject to severe tensions and Slovakia has not devalued, on its own initiative, the SKK bilateral central rate against the euro,—in the year ending March 2008, the long-term interest rate in Slovakia was, on average, 4,5 percent which is below the reference value.\n\n(—) the average inflation rate in Slovakia in the year ending March 2008 stood at 2,2 percent, which is well below the reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead, albeit with a narrowing margin,\n\n(—) the budget deficit in Slovakia has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 percent of GDP; the Commission therefore recommended to the Council to abrogate Decision 2005/182/EC of 5 July 2004 on the existence of an excessive deficit for Slovakia(13),\n\n(—) Slovakia has been a member of ERM II since 28 November 2005; in the two-year period ending 18 April 2008, the Slovak koruna (SKK) has not been subject to severe tensions and Slovakia has not devalued, on its own initiative, the SKK bilateral central rate against the euro,\n\n(—) in the year ending March 2008, the long-term interest rate in Slovakia was, on average, 4,5 percent which is below the reference value.\n\n((14)) By Decision 2008/562/EC(14)the Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, abrogated Decision 2005/182/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Slovakia.\n\n((15)) According to Article 122(2) of the Treaty the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal by the Commission, is to decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nSlovakia fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 108 (3) thereof,
Whereas the Italian Government decided, pursuant to Article 109 of the EEC Treaty, to introduce, as from 28 May 1981, a requirement that certain purchases of foreign currency should be subject to the establishment at an authorized bank of a non-interest-bearing deposit frozen for 90 days, of an amount in Italian lire equivalent to 30 % of the lire value of the transaction, and that the period of application of the measure concerned would expire on 30 September 1981;
Whereas, on 1 July 1981, the Commission addressed a recommendation to the Italian Government pursuant to Article 108 (1) of the EEC Treaty ; whereas it recommended the Italian Republic to take urgently certain economic policy measures;
Whereas the Italian Government, by its letters of 31 August and 5 September 1981, informed the Commission of the first measures taken in application of that recommendation and expressed its intention of introducing, in the near future, the measures required to meet the aims of a policy of economic recovery;
Whereas the Italian Government is of the opinion that the complete abolition of the deposit requirement would be likely to cause disturbances in internal and external monetary flows ; whereas the Italian Government therefore proposes to maintain this measure in force, except in respect of steel products, whilst reducing gradually the percentage of the deposit ; whereas the deposit would be reduced to 25 % as from 1 October 1981, to 20 % as from 1 January 1982, to 15 % as from 1 March 1982, and would then expire on 1 April 1982;
Whereas mutual assistance has not been granted pursuant to Article 108 (2) of the EEC Treaty;
Whereas the abrogation of the measure in question on the date originally laid down would tend to aggravate the current account deficit at a critical moment in its seasonal cycle or to cause liquidity to swell;
Whereas authorization for the Italian Government to maintain the measures relating to the compulsory deposit in force, for a limited period and subject to certain conditions, is therefore justified ; whereas extending the period during which the deposit is required is likely, however, to cause disturbances in trade in certain categories of goods ; whereas, therefore, the period of validity of this measure should be limited to five months and agricultural produce and non-ferrous metals excluded from the scope thereof with effect from 1 October 1981,","{'title': '81/803/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 September 1981 authorizing the Italian Republic to maintain in force the requirement of a deposit when purchases of foreign currency are made (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Italian Republic is hereby authorized to maintain in force the measures provided for by the decrees of 27 May and 24 July 1981 issued by the Ministry of External Trade concerning the system of obligatory deposits, subject to the following conditions:    (a) the obligation to establish the deposit shall cease with effect from 1 March 1982;\n\n(b) the percentage applicable to those transactions subject to a deposit shall be reduced to 25 % on 1 October 1981, to 20 % on 1 January 1982 and to 15 % on 1 February 1982;\n\n(c) the list of transactions exempt from the obligation to provide a deposit shall include, with effect from 1 October 1981, imports of:  - agricultural products listed in Annex II to the Treaty, with the exception of these referred to in the Annex to this Decision, and products falling within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3033/80,\n\nand\n\n- non-ferrous metals (Chapters 74 to 81 of the Common Customs Tariff).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Commission shall supervise the application of this Decision and reserves the right to modify the conditions relating thereto.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 September 1981.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrançois-Xavier ORTOLI\n\nVice-President'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 833/2003(4), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas any disparity between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States on the disposal of batteries and accumulators could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Community and may thereby have a direct impact on  the establishment and functioning of the internal market; whereas it therefore appears necessary to approximate the laws in the field;
Whereas Article 2 (2) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (4), as amended by Directive 91/156/EEC (5), provides that specific rules for particular instances or supplementing those of the said Directive in order to regulate the  management of particular categories of waste shall be laid down by means of individual Directives;
Whereas the objectives and principles of the Community's environment policy, as set out in the European Community action programmes on the environment on the basis of the principles enshrined in Article 130r (1) and (2) of the EEC Treaty, aim in  particular at preventing, reducing and as far as possible eliminating pollution and ensuring sound management of raw materials resources, on the basis also of the 'polluter pays' principle;
Whereas, in order to achieve these objectives, the marketing of certain batteries and accumulators should be prohibited, in view of the amount of dangerous substances they contain;
Whereas, to ensure that spent batteries and accumulators are recovered and disposed of in a controlled manner, Member States must take measures to ensure that they are marked and collected separately;
Whereas collection and recycling of spent batteries and accumulators can help avoid unnecessary use of raw materials;
Whereas appliances containing non-removable batteries or accumulators may represent an environmental hazard when they are disposed of; whereas Member States should therefore take appropriate measures;
Whereas programmes should be set up in the Member States to achieve the various objectives set out above; whereas the Commission should be informed of these programmes and of the specific measures taken;
Whereas recourse to economic instruments such as the setting up of a deposit system may encourage the separate collection and recycling of spent batteries and accumulators;
Whereas provision should be made for consumer information in this field;
Whereas provision should be made for appropriate procedures to implement the provisions of this Directive, particularly the making system, and to ensure that the Directive can be easily adapted to scientific and technical progress; whereas the committee  referred to in Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC should be instructed to assist the Commission in these tasks,","{'title': 'Council Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aim of this Directive is to approximate the laws of the Member States on the recovery and controlled disposal of those spent batteries and accumulators containing dangerous substances in accordance with Annex I.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n\n(a) 'battery or accumulator' means a source of electrical energy generated by direct conversion of chemical energy and consisting of one or more primary (non-rechargeable) batteries or secondary (rechargeable) cells, as listed in Annex I;\n\n(b) 'spent battery or accumulator' means a battery or accumulator which is not re-usable and is intended for recovery or disposal;\n\n(c) 'disposal' means any operation, provided that it is applicable to batteries and accumulators, included in Annex II A to Directive 75/442/EEC;\n\n(d) 'recovery' means any operation, provided that it is applicable to batteries and accumulators, included in Annex II B to Directive 75/442/EEC;\n\n(e) 'collection' means the gathering, sorting and/or grouping together of spent batteries and accumulators;\n\n(f) 'deposit system' means a system under which the buyer, upon purchase of batteries or accumulators, pays the seller a sum of money which is refunded when the spent batteries or accumulators are returned.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 839/2012
of 18 September 2012
concerning the authorisation of urea as a feed additive for ruminants
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of products authorised pursuant to Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition (2).
(2) Urea was authorised without a time limit by Directive 82/471/EEC. That product was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of urea as a feed additive for ruminants, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 7 March 2012 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, urea does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it provides non-protein nitrogen for microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of urea shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since modifications to the conditions of authorisation of urea are introduced and as there are no direct immediate effects on safety, a reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before authorisation in order to allow the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation. In addition, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of urea, as authorised by Directive 82/471/EEC, and of feed containing urea.
(7) It is disproportionately complex for operators to adapt repeatedly and from one day to the other labels of feed containing different additives which have been successively authorised according to the procedure laid down in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and for which new labelling rules are to be complied with. It is therefore appropriate to reduce the administrative burden on the operators by providing a period of time allowing a smooth conversion of labelling.
