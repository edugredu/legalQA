Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (1), and in particular Article 79(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishes a Community system for control, inspection and enforcement to ensure compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy. Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 provides that, without prejudice to the primary responsibility of the coastal Member States, Union inspectors may carry out inspections in accordance with that Regulation in Union waters and on Union fishing vessels outside Union waters. The list of Union inspectors is to be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.
(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (2) lays down detailed rules for the application of the control system of the European Union as established by Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009.
(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 provides that the list of Union inspectors is to be adopted on the basis of the notifications of Member States and of the European Fisheries Control Agency.
(4) A first list of Union inspectors was adopted in Commission Implementing Decision 2011/883/EU (3). Article 120 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 provides that after the establishment of the initial list, Member States and the European Fisheries Control Agency shall notify by October any amendment to the list they wish to introduce for the following calendar year, and that the Commission shall amend the list accordingly by 31 December.
(5) Some Member States have notified whole lists of their relevant inspectors. It is therefore appropriate to replace the list established in Implementing Decision 2011/883/EU and to lay down in the Annex to this Decision a new list of Union inspectors on the basis of these notifications and notifications on amendments to the initial list received from Member States.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (1), and in particular Article 43(d) in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 39(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (2) provides that the intervention agencies may sell sugar only after a decision to that effect has been adopted by the Commission.
(2) Such a decision was taken by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1059/2007 of 14 September 2007 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden (3). Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 10 and 24 September 2008.
(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is therefore appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available on the internal market.
(4) To allow comparison of tender prices for sugar of different qualities, the tender price should refer to sugar of the standard quality as defined in Part B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(5) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.
(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.
(7) The minimum selling price refers to sugar of the standard quality. Provision should be made to adjust the selling price in cases where the sugar is not of this quality.
(8) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.
(9) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States on the quantities actually sold.
(10) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 (4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 24 October 1984
concerning aid which the Belgian Government granted in 1983 to a ceramic sanitary ware and crockery manufacturer
(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)
(85/153/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
After giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments in accordance with the above provision, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
The Belgian Government decided to assist a ceramics manufacturer at La LouviĂ¨re through a subscription of Bfrs 83 million of new capital by the regional investment agency, the Wallonia Regional Investment Corporation (SRIW).
On 16 February 1983 the Commission had taken a decision finding that a subscription of Bfrs 475 million of new capital in the same company in 1981 was incompatible with the common market and had to be recovered.
After learning of the Belgian Government's intention to come to the firm's assistance again, the Commission raised the matter with the Belgian Government in telexes and letters sent on 31 January, 24 February, 7 June, 20 and 22 July, 1 September and 25 October 1983, stressing that such measures had to be notified at the proposal stage under Article 93 (3) of the Treaty. The Commission also on a number of occasions reminded the Belgian Government that it could be ordered to recover aid it had granted without giving the Commission an opportunity to determine whether it was compatible with the common market. When a notice was published in the Moniteur Belge of 25 August 1983 announcing that the Belgian authorities had subscribed Bfrs 83 million of new capital in the company, the Commission contacted not only the Belgian Government but also the SRIW and the company itself to make it clear that any aid granted without observing the notification procedure and without allowing the Commission to determine beforehand whether it was compatible with the common market could be subject to a recovery order.
The Belgian Government replied to the Commission's reminders by telexes sent on 18 February and 29 July 1983 stating that a decision to subscribe Bfrs 125 million towards further capital increases had been taken in 1981 and was therefore not new. On 1 December 1983 the Belgian Government telexed the Commission to say that further information on the new capital injection would be sent by the middle of December, but the Commission never received this information or any formal notification under Article 93 (3). On 17 April 1984 the Commission decided to open the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) in respect of the new assistance since it did not appear to qualify for any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3), the only ones potentially applicable, and on 25 May 1984 gave the Belgian Government notice by letter to submit its comments.
The Belgian Government replied to the opening of the Article 93 (2) procedure by letter dated 6 August 1984, in which it confirmed that the subscription of Bfrs 83 million of new capital had taken place in 1983 under the Government's decision taken in 1981. It claimed, however, that the Commission had been informed of the decision by the telex sent on 18 February 1983, which constituted a notification, to which the Commission had failed to respond, and that after such a long time the Commission's objections were inadmissible. It also argued that the Commission was practising discrimination between public and private shareholders.
The governments of four other Member States, one trade association and two individual firms from the industry replied to the Commission's invitation to comment and stated that they shared the Commission's concern about the Belgian Government's assistance of the company. Three of the Member States, the trade association and the two individual firms considered that the repeated assistance given to the company would cause serious distortions of competition.
The provision of public funds to companies in the form of subscriptions of new capital may involve elements of State aid. The company in the present case was handicapped by its financial position and by the current overcapacity in the ceramics industry, particularly the sanitary-ware sector, which made it unlikely that it would be able to raise on the private capital market the finance necessary for its survival.
The firm has been making substantial losses for a number of years: Bfrs 134 million in 1979, Bfrs 243 million in 1980, Bfrs 302 million in 1981 and Bfrs 168 million in 1982. These losses represented respectively 23, 39, 45 and 20 % of its turnover in those years. The firm's accumulated arrears to the social security fund also increased between 1979 and 1983 from Bfrs 120,8 million to 248,5 million. When the Bfrs 475 million granted in 1981 is recovered as the Commission has ordered in its Decision of 16 February 1983, the company's financial position will be even worse.
In these circumstances the injection of Bfrs 83 million of new equity in the company by the State constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
Such aid intended to preserve production capacity which market forces would ordinarily cause to go out of business, allowing expansion by more efficient competitors, is likely to have a particularly adverse effect on competitive conditions. The company exports over 70 % of its output of ceramic sanitary ware to the other Member States. Hence the aid is likely to affect trade between Member States and distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty by favouring the firm in question and the production of ceramic sanitary ware and crockery.
Article 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market. The exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) require that the aid should serve specified Community objectives rather than simply serving the interests of the aid recipient. These exceptions must be construed narrowly when any regional or industry aid scheme or any individual award under a general scheme is scrutinized. In particular, they may be invoked only when the Commission is satisfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would be insufficient to guide the recipients towards patterns of behaviour that would serve one of the said objectives.
To apply the exceptions in the case of aid that did not serve such an objective would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.
In applying the principles set out above in its scrutiny of individual aid awards, the Commission must satisfy itself that the aid is justified by the contribution the recipient is making to one of the objectives specified in Article 92 (3) and is necessary to that end. Where this cannot be demonstrated, it is evident that the aid does not serve the objectives specified in the exceptions clauses, but does little more than bolster the financial position of the recipient.
The recipient in the present case cannot be said to be serving one of the objectives.
The Belgian Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the aid in question fulfils the conditions for application of one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3).
With regard to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aids that promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, the La LouviĂ¨re area is not one where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (a) and the Belgian aid award does not have the requisite features of aid to facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (c). Nor has the aid measure the features of a 'project of common European interest' or of a project likely to 'remedy a serious disturbance' in the Belgian economy, so as to qualify for the exception in Article 92 (3) (b). Belgium belongs to the central regions of the Community, which do not have, by Community standards, the most severe economic and social problems and in which there is a greater danger than elsewhere of a competitive bidding-up of aid and of aid affecting trade between Member States. The data available on the economic and social situation in Belgium do not indicate that its economy is suffering from a serious disturbance of the kind referred to in the Treaty, and the action of the Belgian Government was not meant to deal with such a situation.
Finally, as for the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) for 'aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities', the situation of the ceramics industry, and particularly the overcapacity that exists in that industry in the Community, suggests that to preserve capacity artificially through aid is against the common interest.
The aid which the Belgian Government has granted to the company in the form of a subscription of new capital therefore does not qualify for application of any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty,","{'title': '85/153/EEC: Commission Decision of 24 October 1984 concerning aid which the Belgian Government granted in 1983 to a ceramic sanitary ware and crockery manufacturer (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific eco-label criteria are to be established according to product groups.
(3) It also provides that the review of the eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to the criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for each product group. That review is to result in a proposal for prolongation, withdrawal or revision.
(4) It is appropriate to revise the ecological criteria that were established by Commission Decision 1999/568/EC of 27 July 1999 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to light bulbs(2) in order to reflect the developments in the market. At the same time, the period of validity of that Decision and the definition of the product group should be modified.
(5) A new Commission Decision should be adopted establishing the specific ecological criteria for this product group, which will be valid for a period of four years.
(6) It is appropriate that, for a limited period of not more than twelve months, both the new criteria established by this Decision and the criteria established by Decision 1999/568/EC should be valid concurrently, in order to allow sufficient time for companies that have been awarded or that have applied for the award of the eco-label for their products prior to the date of application of this Decision to adapt those products to comply with the new criteria.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are based on the draft criteria developed by the European Union Eco-Labelling Board established under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee instituted by Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000,","{'title': '2002/747/EC: Commission Decision of 9 September 2002 establishing revised ecological criteria for the award of the Community eco-label to light bulbs and amending Decision 1999/568/EC (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 3310)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn order to be awarded the Community eco-label under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a light bulb must fall within the product group ""light bulbs"" as defined in Article 2, and must comply with the ecological criteria set out in the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

The criteria are set at levels that promote the labelling of light bulbs that are produced with low environmental impact.\n\nAssessment and verification requirements\n\nThe specific assessment and verification requirements are indicated within each criterion. Testing should be performed by appropriately accredited laboratories or laboratories that meet the general requirements expressed in standard EN ISO 17025 and are competent to perform the relevant tests.\n\nWhere the applicant is required to provide declarations, documentation, analyses test reports or other evidence to the competent body assessing the application in order to show compliance with the criteria, it is understood that these may originate from the applicant and/or his supplier(s) and/or their supplier(s), et cetera, as appropriate. The competent body assessing the application may carry out independent verifications.\n\nThe competent bodies are recommended to take into account the implementation of recognised environmental management schemes, such as EMAS or ISO14001, when assessing applications and monitoring compliance with the criteria (Note: it is not required to implement such management schemes).\n\nCRITERIA\n\n1. Energy efficiency, lifetime, lumen maintenance and mercury content\n\nSingle-ended light bulbs shall meet the following requirements:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nDouble-ended light bulbs shall meet the following requirements:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNote:\n\nEnergy efficiency is as defined in Annex IV of Commission Directive 98/11/EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75/EEC with regard to energy labelling of household lamps(1).\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the energy efficiency, lifetime and lumen maintenance of the light bulb have been determined using the test procedures referred to in EN 50285. The report shall state the energy efficiency, lifetime and lumen maintenance of the light bulb. If the appropriate lifetime test has not been completed, the operational lifetime as stated on the packaging is acceptable pending the result of the test. However, the result of the test must be provided within 12 months of the date of application for the eco-label.\n\nThe applicant shall provide a test report stating that the mercury content has been measured using the method described below. The report shall state the average mercury content, calculated by analysing ten lamps, and then deleting the highest and lowest values before calculating the arithmetic mean of the remaining eight values.\n\nThe test method for the mercury content is as follows. The arc tube is first separated from its plastic surrounds and associated electronics. The associated leadwires are cut as close to the glass seal as possible. The arc tube is taken to a fume cupboard and is cut into segments. The segments are placed in a suitably sized robust screw-capped plastic bottle to which is added a 1 inch diameter porcelain ball and 25 ml of high purity concentrated nitric acid (70 %). The bottle is sealed and shaken for a few minutes to reduce the arc tube to fine particle size, the stopper is periodically loosened to eliminate any possibility of pressure build-up. The contents of the bottle are allowed to react for 30 minutes during which time the contents are periodically agitated. The contents of the bottle are then filtered through an acid resistant filter paper and collected in a 100 ml graduated volumetric flask. Potassium dichromate is then added to the flask so that the final concentration is 1000 ppm with respect to chromium. The flask is then made up to volume with pure water. Matched standards are made up on a concentration range up to 200 ppm mercury. The solutions are analysed using flame atomic absorption at a wavelength of 253,7 nm with background correction on. From the results obtained and knowledge of the solution volume, the original mercury content of the light bulb can be computed. The competent body may agree adaptations to the details of this test method if they are necessary for technical reasons, and these shall be applied in a consistent manner.\n\n2. Switch on/off\n\nFor compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), the number of switch on/off cycles shall be greater than 20000.\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the number of switch on/off cycles for a CFL has been determined using a rapid cycle test (0,5 minute on, 4,5 minutes off) and the test procedures for lifetime referred to in EN 50285. The report shall state the number of switch on/off cycles achieved when 50 % of CFLs tested meet the requirements for lamp lifetime referred to in EN 50285.\n\n3. Colour rendering index\n\nThe colour rendering (Ra) index of the light bulb shall be greater than 80.\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall provide a test report stating that the colour rendering index of the light bulb has been determined using the test procedure referred to in CIE-standard/publication 29/2. The report shall state the colour rendering index of the light bulb.\n\n4. Flame retardants\n\n(a) Plastic parts heavier than 5 g shall not contain the following flame retardants:\n\n>TABLE>\n\n(b) Plastic parts heavier than 5 g shall not contain flame retardant substances or preparations containing substances that are assigned at the time of application any of the following risk phrases (or combinations thereof):\n\nR45 (may cause cancer)\n\nR46 (may cause heritable genetic damage)\n\nR50 (very toxic to aquatic organisms)\n\nR51 (toxic to aquatic organisms)\n\nR52 (harmful to aquatic organisms)\n\nR53 (may cause long-term adverse effects in the aquatic environment)\n\nR60 (may impair fertility)\n\nR61 (may cause harm to the unborn child)\n\nas defined in Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(2) and its subsequent amendments.\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n\n5. Packaging\n\nLaminates and composite plastics must not be used.\n\nFor single-ended light bulbs, all cardboard packaging must contain a minimum of 65 % recycled material (by weight).\n\nFor double-ended light bulbs, all cardboard packaging must contain a minimum of 80 % recycled material (by weight).\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements.\n\n6. User instructions\n\nThe product shall be sold with relevant user information providing advice on its proper environmental use. In particular:\n\n(a) Information (pictogram or otherwise) on the packaging shall draw attention to the appropriate disposal conditions, including regulatory requirements.\n\n(b) For single-ended light bulbs: light bulbs which do not operate on dimmer switches shall be labelled, and the relative size and shape of the light bulb compared to a conventional incandescent lamp shall be indicated on the packaging.\n\n(c) For double-ended light bulbs: information on the packaging shall indicate that the environmental performance of the light bulb is improved when it is used with high frequency electronic control equipment.\n\n(d) The product packaging shall indicate that more information on the eco-label can be found at the web-site address: http://europa.eu.int/ecolabel.\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with these requirements, and shall provide a copy of the packaging to the competent body assessing the application.\n\n7. Information appearing on the eco-label\n\nBox 2 of the eco-label shall include the following text: ""High energy efficiency\n\nLong lifetime""\n\nIf the light bulb does not contain mercury, Box 2 of the eco-label may state that the lightbulb does not contain mercury.\n\nAssessment and verification: The applicant shall declare the compliance of the product with this requirement, and shall provide a copy of the eco-label as it appears on the packaging and/or product to the competent body assessing the application.\n\n(1) OJ L 71, 10.3.1998, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ 196 of 16.8.1967, p. 1.'}]}"

fixing the export refunds on beef and veal
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulations (EEC) No 32/82 (2), (EEC) No 1964/82 (3), (EEC) No 2388/84 (4), (EEC) No 2973/79 (5) and (EC) No 2051/96 (6) lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products, and the conditions for granting of assistance concerning certain destinations.
(3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below.
(4) With regard to live animals, for reasons of simplification, export refunds should not be granted for categories in which there is insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover, in the light of the general concern for animal welfare, export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible.
(5) Consequently, export refunds for such animals should be granted only for third countries which, for cultural or religious reasons, traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter.
(6) As to live animals for reproduction, in order to prevent any abuse, export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age.
(7) In order to enable some Community beef and veal products to be disposed of on the international market, export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some products under CN codes 0201, 0202 and 1602 50.
(8) The uptake of export refunds for certain categories of beef and veal products proves to be insignificant. This is also the case with regard to the uptake for certain destinations very close to the Community territory. For such categories, export refunds should no longer be fixed.
(9) The refunds provided for in this Regulation are set on the basis of the product codes as defined in the nomenclature adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (7).
(10) The refunds on all frozen cuts should be in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.
(11) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (8).
(12) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (9), Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (10) and Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (11).
(13) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(14) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished. That abolition should not, however, lead to a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 10 (4) thereof,
Whereas following scientific results on the inactivation of the agents of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie, Commission Decision 96/449/EC (3) has laid down rules for the approval of alternative heat-treatment systems for the processing of mammalian animal waste in the Community;
Whereas during recent inspections and bilateral meetings certain Member States indicated that difficulties have been encountered in the implementation of the processing standards laid down in the Annex to Decision 96/449/EC; whereas pending full implementation of those processing standards, mammalian animal waste continues to be treated in systems which are ineffective for the complete inactivation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents; whereas Member States may authorize the processing of mammalian animal waste by a method which does not comply with the processing standards set out in the Annex to Decision 96/449/EC if such processing is preceded or followed by a process which achieves the parameters set out in that Annex or if the resulting proteinaceous material is destroyed by burial, incineration, burning as fuel or a similar method which ensures safe disposal;
Whereas mammalian meat-and-bone meal not produced in accordance with the Annex to Decision 96/449/EC could represent a risk for animal health regarding transmission of TSE agents; whereas it is necessary to prohibit the sending of such meat-and-bone meal to other Member States except under certain circumstances; whereas, in addition, the same prohibition should also apply to exports to third countries so as to prevent deflections of trade;
Whereas some Member States have informed the Commission that they do not have sufficient capacity on their territory to incinerate processed mammalian animal waste which has not been treated in accordance with Decision 96/449/EC and which was derived from carcasses of animals killed in the context of disease-control measures or containing parts of animals excluded from the feed and food chain according to national eradication plans for BSE; whereas such material is an intermediate product; whereas such material may be sent to other Member States for incineration or burning as fuel; whereas it is necessary to set strict conditions to ensure that such material is safely disposed of and cannot enter any food or feed chain; whereas pursuant to Commission Decision 96/239/EC (4), as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (5), that possibility is not applicable to the United Kingdom;
Whereas some Member States have informed the Commission that some rendering plants are still in the process of complying with Decision 96/449/EC because of difficulties in the supply of new equipment; whereas in the meantime those plants are not permitted to place their meat-and-bone meal on the market; whereas under Article 4 of Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedstuffs of animal or fish origin and amending Directive 90/425/EEC (6), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, a Member State may decide to designate a high-risk processing plant in another Member State after agreement with the other Member State; whereas it is necessary for a transitional period, pending the full implementation of Decision 96/449/EC, to set strict conditions to ensure that such meat-and-bone meal is further processed in the other Member State by a process which achieves the parameters set out in the Annex to that Decision; whereas pursuant to Decision 96/239/EC that possibility is not applicable to the United Kingdom;
Whereas mammalian animal waste to which Decision 96/449/EC applies and which has not been processed in accordance with the standards set out in the Annex to that Decision should not be fed to animals; whereas pursuant to Commission Decision 94/381/EC (7), as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (8), the feeding to ruminant species of protein derived from mammalian tissues, with the exception of milk, gelatine, and certain other products, is prohibited;
Whereas Article 13 of Directive 90/667/EEC establishes that for the purpose of trade, processed products obtained from high-risk or low-risk materials must be accompanied by a commercial document; whereas recent inspections in Member States have shown that in the absence of uniform commercial documents and in the light of deficiencies in the application of Community legislation, traceability of meat-and-bone meal from production to feeding is not practicable, in particular, for material entering intra-Community trade; whereas in order to guarantee traceability of processed mammalian animal waste entering intra-Community trade, a model of a commercial document must be laid down; whereas, pending full implementation of Decision 96/449/EC, that commercial document should be accompanied by an official declaration that the material was produced in an approved plant which complies with the processing standards laid down in the Annex to Decision 96/449/EC;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,","{'title': '97/735/EC: Commission Decision of 21 October 1997 concerning certain protection measures with regard to trade in certain types of mammalian animal waste (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

setting up a group of experts to advise the Commission on a strategy for dealing with accidents in the transport sector
(2003/425/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) A high and uniform level of protection for European citizens should at all times be ensured in all modes of transport, and a strategy should be introduced to reduce the number of accidents. Independent technical investigations of transport accidents and incidents are one way of improving safety by identifying the causes of such accidents and thereby preventing them from occurring.
(2) Investigations into the causes of accidents should not be linked to compensation for damages or determination of liability. Therefore, they should be independent of investigations conducted by the judicial authorities, insurance companies, industry, operators and regulators, or any other party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the investigating body or entity.
(3) In its White Paper on European transport policy for 2010: time to decide(1), the Commission indicated that there is a growing need for independent technical investigations geared towards revealing the causes of accidents and ways of improving legislation. For this purpose, in the White Paper the Commission recommended the creation of ""a group of independent experts within the Commission, whose job would be to improve the existing legislation and adapt the (European) methodology, inter alia, to technical developments"".
(4) For the examination of all issues pertinent to independent technical accident investigations, the Commission intends to set up a Group of Experts to advise the Commission on a strategy for dealing with accidents in the transport sector.
(5) The setting up of this Group will contribute to the advancement of Community policy in the field of independent accident investigations, alongside other appropriate consultation procedures. The Group should advise the Commission on the need to improve existing legislation, and, where necessary, on the need to propose new initiatives for all modes of transport, including transport of energy (oil and gas pipelines),","{'title': '2003/425/EC: Commission Decision of 11 June 2003 setting up a group of experts to advise the Commission on a strategy for dealing with accidents in the transport sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nSubject\n\nA group of experts to advise the Commission on a strategy for dealing with accidents in the transport sector, hereinafter referred to as the ""Group of Experts"", is hereby set up.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nMission\n\nThe Group of Experts shall advise the Commission on the need to improve existing legislation, and, where necessary, on the need to propose new initiatives for all modes of transport, including the transport of energy (oil and gas pipelines), but excluding the occupational health and safety aspects.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nComposition\n\nThe Group of Experts shall be composed of qualified individuals competent to consider matters relating to transport safety issues, in particular independent technical accidents investigations in all modes of transport, including the transport of energy (oil and gas pipelines).

concerning a draft Regulation from the Hellenic Republic on the labelling of bakery products from frozen dough
(notified under document number C(2007) 6750)
(Only the Greek text is authentic)
(2008/35/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 19 and 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 19(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC, the Greek authorities notified to the Commission on 15 May 2007 a draft Regulation on specific provisions on the compulsory labelling of bakery products from frozen dough.
(2) Pursuant to the notified draft, bakery products from frozen dough should be labelled with the date of production and the origin of the frozen dough.
(3) In accordance with the provisions of Article 19(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC, the Commission consulted Member States via the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
(4) Directive 2000/13/EC contains provisions on the labelling of the origin of foodstuffs (Article 3(1) points 7 and 8) and of the types of date indications for foodstuffs (Article 9(5)). According to these rules, particulars of the place of origin or provenance of a foodstuff shall only be compulsory on the labelling of foodstuff, where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff (Article 3(1) point 8).
(5) A mandatory labelling of the country of origin of the frozen dough would be an extra burden for those food business operators that produce bread with dough from another EU Member State and therefore constitute a potential barrier to the free movement of goods and endangers the smooth functioning of the single market. The cases where non-harmonised national provisions governing the labelling and presentation of certain foodstuffs or foodstuffs in general may be acceptable are listed in an exhaustive manner in Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC. Apart from cases relating to the protection of public health, such measures may be admissible only where justified for the prevention of fraud or the protection of industrial and commercial property rights, indications of provenance, registered designations of origin and prevention of unfair competition.
(6) The grounds of the Greek notification do refer to hygienic reasons and thus to the protection of public health. The Greek notification does not take into account that there is an established basis of common rules on food hygiene, especially Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2). The Greek notification does not provide any evidence that the notified measures are necessary to attain a higher level of public health protection.
(7) According to Article 9(5) dash 5 of Directive 2000/13/EC, an indication of the durability date for bakers’ or pastry cooks’ wares shall not be required, subject to Community provisions imposing other types of date indication. Community law does not provide any rule on any other type of date indications but the exemption for bakers’ wares for the indication of the durability date.
(8) A compulsory labelling of the production date of the frozen dough would concern in particular products from other Member States that only can be marketed after having undergone a preservation procedure like freezing. This obligation therefore constitutes a potential barrier to the free movement of goods and endangers the smooth functioning of the single market.
(9) According to the case law the competent national authorities have to proof, that the draft measures are on the one hand necessary in order to achieve the objective they aim for and that the draft measures comply on the other hand with the principle of proportionality (cf. ruling of 30 November 1983, Van Bennekom, Case 227/82, ECR 1983, p. 03883, paragraph 40; ruling of 13 March 1997, Morellato, Case C-358/95, ECR 1997, p. I-01431, paragraph 14, and ruling of 8 May 2003, ATRAL, Case C-14/02, ECR 2003, p. I-4431, paragraph 67).
(10) The notified measures applied unilaterally and indiscriminately by the Hellenic Republic would very likely hinder intra-Community trade to a disproportionate extent. It would oblige producers or operators processing dough from other Member States to provide specific labelling.
(11) The Commission will be continuing discussions with the Member States with regard to origin labelling of foodstuffs.
(12) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article 19(3) of Directive 2000/13/EC.

Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure uniform application of the Combined Nomenclature annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of the goods referred to in the Annex to this Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 has laid down the general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature. Those rules apply also to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivision to it and which is established by specific Community provisions, with a view to the application of tariff and other measures relating to trade in goods.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002 of 29 July 2002 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary(1), and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002, the Community has established for each marketing year, import tariff quotas at a zero rate of duty for 600000 tonnes of wheat and meslin, wheat or meslin flours, durum wheat groats and meal, common wheat groats and meal and wheat pellets, and 450000 tonnes of maize (corn), maize (corn) seed, maize (corn) flour, maize groats and meal and maize pellets.
(2) To ensure that imports of the cereal products covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.
(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.
(4) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.
(5) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(3), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.
(6) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(5).
(7) Rapid two-way communication must be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.
(8) As Council Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 1408/2002, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2511/2000(6) laying down the detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1727/2000 should be repealed.

amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 994/2007 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silicon originating in the People’s Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) On 30 November 2006, the Commission announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of ferro-silicon (FeSi) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia.
(2) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 994/2007 (3) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of FeSi, currently classifiable within CN codes 7202 21 00, 7202 29 10 and 7202 29 90, originating in the People's Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia. The measures applicable to these imports consist of an ad valorem duty, except for an exporting producer in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia from which an undertaking was accepted in the said Regulation.
(3) In the context of the examination on whether the price undertaking continues to be practical, it was found that FeSi prices continued to fluctuate after the imposition of the provisional measures and the acceptance of the undertaking. Overall, it was found that FeSi prices showed a considerable volatility. Due to the above described volatility of the price, it was concluded that the fixed minimum import prices (MIPs) of the undertaking are no longer a valid form of measure in view of the findings made during the investigation.
(4) In order to overcome this problem, the possibility to index the MIPs to the price of the main cost input was examined. It was concluded, however, that the volatility in prices on the market cannot be merely explained by an increase in the price of the main cost input, thus it is not possible to index the minimum import prices. Therefore, it was concluded that the undertaking in its current form, namely with fixed minimum prices is not workable any longer and that the problem posed by the fixed character of the minimum price would not be remedied by means of price indexation. Therefore, it was concluded that FeSi is not considered anymore suitable for a fixed price undertaking (see also recitals 131 and 132 of Council Regulation (EC) No 172/2008 (4)) and that the acceptance of the undertaking offered by the company concerned should be withdrawn.
(5) The company concerned was informed of the Commission's conclusions and given an opportunity to comment.
(6) The company claimed that the Commission's reasoning for the withdrawal of the undertaking contradicts its Community interest analysis whereby it stated in its disclosure to the company that ‘while the information available shows that FeSi prices have indeed followed an upward trend in the months following the IP, the prices for major cost inputs of FeSi have also increased in the same period’.
(7) In this respect, it is noted that the above statement, as confirmed in recital 106 of Regulation (EC) No 172/2008, does not establish a correlation between the price evolution of FeSi and the cost of inputs but was intended to explain the economic situation of the Community industry. Indeed, in accordance with the Commission established practice regarding indexation of the MIPs, the MIPs can be indexed only in cases where the price of the product subject to the undertaking varies depending on the main input. In this particular case, the cost of the main input (electricity) did not show a strong correlation with the increase of the price of FeSi. Even if there had been correlation between the prices of FeSi and its main input, in view of the divergent electricity prices on different markets, no suitable source of information regarding electricity prices exists as a basis to index a MIP, contrary to commodity prices for other products such as oil. Moreover, other raw materials such as coke and quartzite also constitute major but variant components of the cost of production of FeSi. Therefore, if the MIPs were indexed to the price of each of these inputs, complex indexing formulae would have to be established making the determination of the parameters of indexation and the workability of the undertakings extremely complex. Therefore, it was concluded that it is not possible to index the minimum import prices to the price of the main cost input, thus the company's claim was rejected accordingly.
(8) The company further claimed that it is against the practice of the Commission to change the level or the form of the measure provisionally determined and/or proposed at definitive stage on the basis of information that covers a period which is subsequent to the IP. In accordance with the clauses of the undertaking, the company was made aware that the Commission may withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking at any stage during its implementation due to changed circumstances from those prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking or because the monitoring and enforcement of the undertaking prove to be impractical and a solution which is acceptable to the Commission is not found. On this basis, the claim was rejected.
(9) The company also claimed that the Commission came to a wrong conclusion in its assessment of the effectiveness of the undertaking partially because it used unverified post-IP data. In this respect, it is noted that the Commission followed its regular practice as it primarily used Eurostat data for its analysis as well as the periodic undertaking report submitted by the company. Accordingly, this claim was rejected.
(10) Therefore, in accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation and also in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking, which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking, the Commission has concluded that the acceptance of the undertaking offered by Silmak Dooel Export Import, Jegunovce should be withdrawn.
(11) In parallel to the current Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 172/2008, has imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silicon originating, inter alia, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which will be applicable to the imports of these products manufactured by the exporting producer concerned,","{'header': '28.2.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 55/23', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 174/2008\nof 27 February 2008\namending Commission Regulation (EC) No 994/2007 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silicon originating in the People’s Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 30 November 2006, the Commission announced, by a notice published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of ferro-silicon (FeSi) originating in the People’s Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia.\n\n((2)) The Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 994/2007(3)imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of FeSi, currently classifiable within CN codes 7202\xa021\xa000, 7202\xa029\xa010 and 7202\xa029\xa090, originating in the People's Republic of China, Egypt, Kazakhstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Articles 10(3), 14 and 30(5) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in food additives, food enzymes, flavourings, nutrients and their conditions of use.
(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 lays down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 (3).
(4) Those lists may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(5) When updating the specifications it is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for food additives as set out in the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives’ specifications adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and also the International Numbering System for Food Additives, i.e., INS name (4).
(6) The currently authorised food colour ‘Brilliant Black BN, Black PN’ (E 151) should be renamed as ‘Brilliant Black PN’ in the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use and in the specifications for this additive for the purpose of clarity and in order to align it with its registered name in the INS.
(7) At present, the definition of the food additive Algal Carotenes (E 160a (iv)) in the specifications reads ‘Mixed carotenes may also be produced from strains of the algae Dunaliella salina, grown in large saline lakes located in Whyalla, South Australia. (…)’ referring to a specific location where the algae are grown, namely, Whyalla. However, in the last years, global demand on algal carotenes has increased and further saline lakes have been established in Australia and in other countries. There is no mention or any restriction about the location(s) where Dunaliella salina is grown in the current Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives’ specifications for algal carotenes (5) and the European Food Safety Authority’s opinion on the re-evaluation of mixed carotenes (E 160a (i)) and beta-carotene (E 160a (ii)) as a food additive (6). Therefore, in order to avoid market disruption, the description of Algal Carotenes (E 160a (iv)) in the specifications should be amended.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 contains errors in the specifications for Calcium Bisulphite (E 227) and Potassium Bisulphite (E 228). Those errors should be corrected.
(9) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 lays down specifications also for Microcrystalline Cellulose (E 460(i)) which indicate that the synonym for this food additive is Cellulose gel. Since the Codex Alimentarius adopted a dual name for Microcrystalline Cellulose (E 460(i)), its designated INS name is ‘Microcrystalline cellulose (Cellulose gel)’. Taking into account previous practice (7) and in order to ensure consistency, and to avoid any disruption in trade, the dual name of Microcrystalline Cellulose, Cellulose Gel should be adopted for the food additive (E 460(i)). Accordingly, the name ‘Cellulose gel’ should be removed from the entry ‘Synonyms’ in the specifications for that food additive and its name should be amended accordingly in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.
(10) The food additive ‘Carboxy methyl cellulose, Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, cellulose gum’ (E 466) should be renamed as ‘Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, Cellulose gum’ in the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and in the specifications for this additive for the purpose of clarity and in order to align it with its registered name in the INS.
(11) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except if the updates in question are not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the updates in the Union lists referred to above are not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.
(12) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '7.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 328/79', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1274/2013\nof 6 December 2013\namending and correcting Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 as regards certain food additives\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.\n\n((2)) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in food additives, food enzymes, flavourings, nutrients and their conditions of use.\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 lays down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008(3).\n\n((4)) Those lists may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.\n\n((5)) When updating the specifications it is necessary to take into account the specifications and analytical techniques for food additives as set out in the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives’ specifications adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission and also the International Numbering System for Food Additives, i.e., INS name(4).\n\n((6)) The currently authorised food colour ‘Brilliant Black BN, Black PN’ (E 151) should be renamed as ‘Brilliant Black PN’ in the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use and in the specifications for this additive for the purpose of clarity and in order to align it with its registered name in the INS.\n\n((7)) At present, the definition of the food additive Algal Carotenes (E 160a (iv)) in the specifications reads ‘Mixed carotenes may also be produced from strains of the algaeDunaliella salina, grown in large saline lakes located in Whyalla, South Australia.

Accordingly, the name ‘Cellulose gel’ should be removed from the entry ‘Synonyms’ in the specifications for that food additive and its name should be amended accordingly in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n\n((10)) The food additive ‘Carboxy methyl cellulose, Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, cellulose gum’ (E 466) should be renamed as ‘Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, Cellulose gum’ in the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 and in the specifications for this additive for the purpose of clarity and in order to align it with its registered name in the INS.\n\n((11)) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission has to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except if the updates in question are not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the updates in the Union lists referred to above are not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the Authority.\n\n((12)) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThe food additives ‘Brilliant Black BN, Black PN’ (E 151) or ‘Carboxy methyl cellulose, Sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, Cellulose gum’ (E 466) and foods containing those food additives, labelled or placed on the market up to twenty four months after the entry into force of this Regulation and which do not comply with the requirements of this Regulation, may be marketed until the stocks are exhausted.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

amending and correcting Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 as regards the support schemes provided for in Titles IV and IVa of that Regulation and the use of land set aside for the production of raw materials
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (1), and in particular Article 145(c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 79 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 establishes specific aid for rice, granted to farmers producing rice falling within CN code 1006 10 under the conditions laid down in Chapter 3 of Title IV of that Regulation.
(2) Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 (2) states that, to be eligible for the crop-specific payment for rice, the declared area must be sown once a year. However, in the case of French Guiana, provision is made for two sowing cycles per year and the aid is granted on the basis of the average of the areas sown for each of the two sowing cycles.
(3) The French authorities intend to redefine the rice production system in French Guiana and reduce production to a single sowing cycle per hectare per year. This new production system would enable the producers concerned to make systematic use of the maintained set-aside, which would largely solve the problem of weeds and free up time needed for levelling. This would lead in particular to water savings and less use of plant protection products. This system would also permit better management of working time and equipment, resulting in lower overall operating costs for the activity. In order to implement this new production system, the means of calculating the specific aid for rice in French Guiana should be adapted, ensuring that the aid is calculated on the basis of a single sowing cycle per year, to be carried out on the latter of the two previously established dates, in other words on 30 June preceding the harvest in question at the latest.
(4) Given that France and Spain have since 2006 applied the single payment scheme and the option provided for in Article 66(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, in accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 101 of that Regulation, the base areas of the Member States indicated in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 must be reduced by the number of hectares corresponding to the compulsory set-aside entitlements. For clarification purposes, entries relating to Member States or regions of Member States where area payments for arable crops no longer apply after 1 January 2006 should be removed from this Annex, while the base areas of Malta and Slovenia which apply area payments for arable crops should be added to it in accordance with Annex XIb to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
(5) The amendment of Article 131(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1250/2006 did not take account of the time limit for the submission of applications established by the second subparagraph of Article 121(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004. This oversight should be corrected. Given this time limit, the deadline for the Member States to communicate the number of bovine animals other than calves in respect of which a slaughter premium has been applied for should be fixed for after 28 February.
(6) There were errors in Article 106(2) and in Annexes VI, XI, XII and XVIII to Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1250/2006.
(7) Given that in the case of the area payments for arable crops laid down in Article 100 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 the overall area determined used to calculate the coefficient of reduction and any definitive rate of overrun must be notified to the Commission by 15 November at the latest, and taking account of the base areas listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004, Annex IV, as amended by this Regulation, should apply from 1 November 2006.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1973/2004 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas pursuant to the Agreement with the United States of America on the Mediterranean preferences, citrus and pasta, the Community has undertaken to suspend provisionally and in part the customs duties applicable to certain fruits and fruit juices  within the limits of Community tariff quotas of appropriate volumes and of varying duration; whereas in order to ensure the balance of reciprocal concessions provided for in the Agreement, the Commission may, by means of a Regulation, suspend the  application of the tariff measures in question;
Whereas the use of these tariff quotas is, however, conditional on presentation to the Community customs authorities of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authorities of the country of origin certifying that the products comply with  the specific characteristics laid down;
Whereas Community tariff quotas for sweet oranges of high quality, citrus hybrids known as 'Minneolas' and certain types of frozen concentrated orange juice should therefore be opened for all or part of 1994;
Whereas all Community importers should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said quotas and the duty rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the  quotas are exhausted;
Whereas the decision for the opening, in the execution of its international obligations, of tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to  authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in  particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;

Wheres it should be stressed that Regulation (EEC) No 3944/89 applies to ensure that the STM functions; whereas, however, the small quantities of Spanish consignments to the other Member States during the period concerned mean that the application of Article 9 of the abovementioned Regulation should be waived;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Articles 13(2) and 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. Prochloraz is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (4) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included prochloraz.
(3) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (6) the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from entry into force of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (7) was adopted on the non-inclusion of prochloraz.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) The application was submitted to Ireland, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) Ireland evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 3 August 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on prochloraz to the Commission on 13 July 2011 (8). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 27 September 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for prochloraz.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing prochloraz may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve prochloraz in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that prochloraz should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(11) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing prochloraz. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(12) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (9) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (10) should be amended accordingly.
(14) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of prochloraz and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning prochloraz in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '11.11.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 293/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1143/2011\nof 10 November 2011\napproving the active substance prochloraz, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 and Commission Decision 2008/934/EC\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC(2)is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I(3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval.

By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((12)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(9)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((13)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(10)should be amended accordingly.\n\n((14)) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of prochloraz and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning prochloraz in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.\n\n((15)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nApproval of active substance\nThe active substance prochloraz, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Re-evaluation of plant protection products', 'text': 'Article 2\nRe-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing prochloraz as an active substance by 30 June 2012.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in Part B of the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing prochloraz as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 31 December 2011 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account Part B of the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.

Whereas Commission Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (3), as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (4), prohibits the exportation of live bovine animals, or any part of them from the United Kingdom to other Member States and their export to third countries as a result of the incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom; whereas the United Kingdom has prohibited the introduction of bovine animals of more than 30 months at the time of slaughter into the human food and animal feed chains; whereas these measures lead to noticeable restrictions in the free movement of beef and involve serious disturbances in the market of the United Kingdom; whereas it is therefore necessary to take exceptional additional measures to support this market;
Whereas in the light of the age structure of the beef bought into intervention by the United Kingdom Intervention Board before 27 March 1996 it is appropriate to remove such products completely from the market; whereas the United Kingdom intervention stocks which had been sold before 27 March 1996 and are still available on the market should therefore be re-purchased, under certain conditions as to their treatment, quality and packaging, by the United Kingdom Intervention Board; whereas, moreover, the UK Intervention Board should be authorized to dispose of these repurchased quantities and of the residual United Kingdom intervention beef which was still in public storage on 27 March 1996, by incineration; whereas, in order to ensure a speedy execution of this measure, it is appropriate to fix a deadline for the incineration of the stocks to be disposed of;
Whereas a Community cofinancing system similar to the one provided for by Commission Regulation (EC) No 716/96 of 19 April 1996 adopting exceptional support measures for the beef market in the United Kingdom (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1512/96 (6) should be established relating to the costs of such operations; whereas, however, the Community shall not cofinance any expenditure related to the transport, take-over, storage and removal of repurchased stocks, and to the transport, rendering and incineration of the repurchased and residual stocks, nor to any technical and financial costs involved with these operations;
Whereas for budgetary reasons deadlines should be laid down for the repurchasing of ex-intervention beef, the payment of the relevant amounts as well as the operations of incineration;
Whereas, it is necessary to ensure that the stocks concerned are destroyed in a manner which does not pose any threat to human health or the health of other animals; whereas, it is therefore necessary, in particular, to specify the conditions of the controls to be carried out by the United Kingdom authorities;
Whereas provision should be made for Commission experts to check compliance with the conditions as specified;

Whereas imports into the Community of certain textile products of categories 14, 17 and 29  originating in the People's Republic of China (herein after referred to as China) have exceeded the  level referred to in Article 10 (1) in conjunction with Annex IX of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93;

Whereas, pending a mutually satisfactory solution, imports into the Community of products falling  within categories 14 and 17 originating in China have been submitted to provisional quantitative  limits for the period of 28 October 1994 to 28 January 1995 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2797/94   (3) and imports into the Community of products falling within category 29 originating in China to a  provisional quantitative limits for the period of 15 November 1994 to 14 February 1995 by  Commission Regulation (EC) No 59/95  (4);

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (1), as last amended by Directive 78/55/EEC of 19 December 1977 (2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,

Having regard to Commission Decision 76/216/EEC of 30 December 1975 authorizing the Federal Republic of Germany to restrict the marketing of seed or propagating material of certain varieties of agricultural plant species (4), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 (1) of the abovementioned Directive, seed or propagating material of these varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially approved in at least one of the Member States and which also fulfil the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, after the expiry of a given period, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety within the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of the abovementioned Directive provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas, with both the abovementioned Decisions, the Commission has authorized the Federal Republic of Germany to prohibit the marketing of seed of durum wheat because it had been well known that the varieties of durum wheat have not yet been suitable for cultivation in the Federal Republic of Germany (Article 15 (3) (c), second case thereof);
Whereas, by Decision 77/146/EEC of 29 December 1976 (5), the Commission has extended for the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of further varieties of durum wheat the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive until 31 December 1977;
Whereas, meanwhile, varieties of durum wheat have been under test for a possible cultivation of this species in that country;
Whereas because of the results of this possible cultivation it can no longer be maintained that varieties of this species are not suitable for cultivation in any part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany;
Whereas, therefore, the conditions of Article 15 (3) (c), second case thereof, of the abovementioned Directive are no longer satisfied in the case of varieties of durum wheat;
Whereas, therefore, the authorizations based on these conditions should be withdrawn;
Whereas for the varieties of durum wheat listed in Decision 77/146/EEC, the Federal Republic of Germany no longer follows its application ; whereas, therefore, these varieties are, with the expiry of the provided period, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions;
Whereas it should be possible for the Federal Republic of Germany to request at a later date, if necessary, a new authorization for any of the varieties concerned, where official growing trials show that these varieties, because of their qualities, do not produce results, in any part of its territory, which correspond to those obtained from other comparable varieties (Article 15 (3) (c), first case thereof);
Whereas, therefore, the period for granting an authorization should be extended appropriately for all varieties concerned;

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources of household appliances(1), and in particular Articles 9 and 12 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Electricity use by refrigerators, freezers and their combinations accounts for a significant part of total Community household energy demand. The further scope for a reduction of energy use by these appliances is substantial.
(2) The success of the labelling scheme introduced by Commission Directive 94/2/EC(2), in conjunction with Directive 96/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 September 1996 on energy efficiency requirements for household electric refrigerators, freezers and combinations thereof(3) has led to a rise of the efficiency index of new refrigerators and freezers by over 30 % between 1996 and 2000.
(3) About 20 % of the cold appliances sold in 2000 were in the most efficient class A, and in some markets the proportion was more than 50 %. The market shares of A class appliances is rising rapidly. Consequently, there is a need to introduce two additional classes, to be designated as A+ and A++, as an interim arrangement until a comprehensive revision of the energy labelling classes takes place.
(4) The effect of labelling on energy efficiency will diminish, or disappear, unless further and more efficient classes are defined.
(5) Directive 94/2/EC should therefore be amended accordingly. By the same occasion, it will be possible to align that Directive on similar directives recently adopted, implementing Directive 92/75/EEC.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 of 15 October 1993 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the fixing and granting of adjusted refunds in respect of cereals exported in the form of certain spirit drinks(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/2000(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 provides that the quantities of cereals eligible for the refund are to be the quantities placed under control and distilled, weighted by a coefficient to be fixed annually for each Member State concerned. That coefficient expresses the ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirituous beverage concerned on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirituous beverage in question. In view of the information provided by Spain on the period 1 January to 31 December 1999, the average ageing period in 1999 was four years for Spanish whisky. The coefficients for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 September 2001 should be fixed.
(2) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area(3) precludes the grant of refunds for exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Therefore, pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93, account should be taken of this in the calculation of the coefficient for 2000/2001.

of 27 August 1999
amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Articles 8(9) and 9 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(2), and in particular Articles 13(9) and 15 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL DUTIES
(1) Within the framework of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations initiated by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), the Commission accepted, by Decision 97/634/EC(4), undertaking offered by the Kingdom of Norway and by 190 Norwegian exporters.
(2) The text of the undertakings provides that failure to submit a quaterly report of all sales transactions to the first unrelated customer in the Community within a prescribed time limit except in the case of force majeure would be construed as a violation of the undertaking, as would non-compliance with the obligation to sell the product concerned on the Community market at or above the minimum prices foreseen in the undertaking.
(3) For the third quarter of 1998, one Norwegian company did not present a report within the prescribed time limit, another Norwegian exporter appeared to have sold the product concerned to the Community market at a price which was below the price envisaged in its undertaking. Two other exporters appeared to have made misleading declarations as to the identity of the exporter and the identity and nature of the sales reported.
(4) The Commission therefore had reason to believe that these four companies had breached the terms of their undertakings and consequently, by Regulation (EC) No 929/1999(5), (hereinafter referred to as the ""provisional duty Regulation""), imposed provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic Salmon falling within CN codes ex 0302 12 00, ex 0304 10 13, ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 13 originating in Norway and exported by the four companies listed in Annex II to that Regulation. By the same Regulation, the Commission deleted the companies concerned from the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC, which listed the companies from which undertaking were accepted.
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE
(5) All four Norwegian companies subject to the provisional duties received disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which these provisional duties were imposed. They were also given an opportunity to submit comments and request a hearing.
(6) Within the time limit set in the provisional duty Regulation, all the Norwegian companies concerned submitted comments in writing and one request a hearing, which was granted. Following these submissions, the Commission sought and examined all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a definitive determination on the apparent violations.
(7) In this regard the Commission's investigation established that one of the companies against which provisional measures had been imposed had not violated its undertaking and that it should be reinstated on the list of companies benefiting from an exemption to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures. The exporter was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to reinstate the Commission's acceptance of its undertaking.
As concerns the other three companies subject to provisional measures, they were informed the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to confirm the withdrawal of the Commission's acceptance of their undertaking and to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties and the definitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duties. They were also granted a period within which make representations subsequent to this disclosure.
(8) The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999(6).
(9) None of the comments submitted, however, have changed the conclusion that definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be imposed on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and exported by the three companies listed in Annex I to this Regulation.
C. DEFINITIVE DUTIES
(10) The investigations which led to the undertakings were concluded by a final determination as to dumping and injury by Regulation (EC) No 1890/97(7), and a final determination as to subsidisation and injury by Regulation (EC) No 1891/97(8). While both these Regulations were repealed by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9), the facts and considerations established therein remain valid (recital 19 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 refers).
(11) In accordance with Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 13(9) of Regulation (EC) No 2067/97 respectively, the rate of the anti-dumping duty and the countervailing duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. In this regard, and in view of recital 107 of Regulation (EC) No 1890/97 and recital 149 of Regulation (EC) No 1891/97, it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duty rates be set at the level, and in the form imposed by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999.
D. DEFINITIVE COLLECTION OF PROVISIONAL DUTIES
(12) A breach of undertaking has been definitively established in relation to the three exporters which have violated their undertakings. It is therefore considered necessary that, in relation to these exporters, the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties be definitively collected at the level of the definitive duties.
E. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999
(13) By Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999, the Commission accepted undertakings from four new exporters, F. Uhrenholt Seafood Norway AS, Mesan Seafood AS, Polaris Seafood AS and Scanfish AS. Pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999, the Commission also extended the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to these companies by adding their names to the Annex to that Regulation.
(14) The Norwegian exporters already on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted, informed the Commission that their names had changed from HerĂ¸y Filetfabrikk AS to Atlantis Filetfabrikk AS and from SL Fjordgruppen AS to Fjord Seafood Leines AS and requested that these changes be reflected in the list of companies benefiting from the exemption payment of anti-dumping and countervailing duties. The Commission has verified that there were no changes in the corporate structures which would call for a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of these companies maintaining their undertakings.
(15) Accordingly, in view of all the above, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 exempting parties listed therein from the duty, should be amended so as the exemption, from the companies listed in Annex I hereto. The Annex should also be updated to take account of the exemption extended by Regulation (EC) No 1826/1999 to F. Uhrenholt Seafood Norway AS, Mesan Seafood AS, Polaris Seafood and Scanfish AS, and of the changes of name of HerĂ¸y Filetfabrikk to Atlantis Filetfabrikk AS and of SL Fjordgruppen AS to Fjord Seafood Leines AS,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1895/1999 of 27 August 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 is hereby replaced by the text in Annex II hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 929/1999 in relation to farmed (other than wild) Atlantic salmon falling within CN codes ex 0302 12 00 (TARIC codes: 0302 12 00*21, 0302 12 00*22, 0302 12 00*23 and 0302 12 00*29 ), ex 0303 22 00 (TARIC codes: 0303 22 00*21, 0303 22 00*22, 0303 22 00*23 and 0303 22 00*29 ), ex 0304 10 13 (TARIC codes: 0304 10 13*21 and 0304 10 13*29 ) and ex 0304 20 13 (TARIC codes: 0304 20 13*21 and 0304 20 13*29 ) originating in Norway and exported by the companies listed in Annex I to this Regulation shall be definitively collected.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 August 1999.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nT.

It is expressed in pascals (Pa) (Type I method). The method also applies to aerated sparkling wines and aerated semi-sparkling wines.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0EQUIPMENT\nThe apparatus measuring the excess pressure in bottles of sparkling and semi-sparkling wine is called an aphrometer. It takes different forms depending on how the bottle is stoppered (metal capsules, cap, cork or plastic stopper).\n2.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Bottles with capsules\nThe aphrometer is in three parts (Figure 1):\n—\nthe top part (a screw needle holder) is made up of a manometer, a manual tightening ring, an endless screw, which slips into the middle part, and a needle, which goes through the capsule. The needle has a lateral hole that transmits pressure to the manometer. A joint ensures that it is tightly sealed onto the capsule of the bottle,\n—\nthe middle part (or the nut) permits the centring of the top part. It is screwed into the lower part, holding the entire apparatus firmly onto the bottle,\n—\nthe lower part (clamp) is equipped with a spur that slips under the ring of the bottle, holding the entire apparatus together. There are rings adapted to fit every kind of bottle.\n2.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Bottles with corks\nThe aphrometer is in two parts (Figure 2):\n—\nthe top part is identical to the previous apparatus, but the needle is longer. It is made up of a long empty tube with a point on one end to help insert the needle through the cork. This point is detachable and falls into the wine once the cork has been pierced,\n—\nthe lower part is made up of a nut and a base sitting on the stopper. This is equipped with four tightening screws used to keep the whole apparatus on the stopper.\nRemarks concerning the manometers that equip these two types of apparatus:\n—\nthey can be either mechanical Bourdon tube-type devices or digital piezoelectric sensors. In the first case, the Bourdon tube must be made of stainless steel,\n—\nthey are graduated in pascals (Pa). For sparkling wine, it is more practical to use 10\n5\npascals (10\n5\nPa) or kilopascals (kPa) as the unit of measurement,\n—\nthey can be from different classes. The class of a manometer is the precision of a reading compared to a full-scale reading expressed as a percentage (e.g. manometer 1\xa0000\xa0kPa class 1 signifies the maximum useable pressure 1\xa0000 kPa, reading at ±\xa010 kPa). Class 1 is recommended for precise measurements.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0PROCEDURE\nMeasurements must be carried out on bottles where the temperature has stabilised for at least 24 hours. After piercing the crown, the cork or plastic stopper, the bottle must be shaken vigorously to reach a constant pressure, in order to take a reading.\n3.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Bottles with capsules\nSlip the clamp over the spur binders under the ring of the bottle. Tighten the nut until the entire apparatus is tight on the bottle. The top part is screwed onto the nut. To avoid any gas escaping, the capsule should be pierced as quickly as possible to bring the joint into contact with the capsule. The bottle must be shaken vigorously until it reached a constant pressure, when a reading can be taken.\n3.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Bottles with corks\nPlace a point at the end of the needle. Position this on the cork. Tighten the four screws on the cork. Tighten top part (the needle goes through the cork). The point must fall into the bottle so that the pressure can be transmitted to the manometer. Take a reading after shaking the bottle until it reaches a constant pressure. Retrieve the point after taking the reading.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0EXPRESSION OF RESULTS\nThe excess pressure at 20\xa0°C (Paph\n20\n) is expressed in pascals (Pa) or kilopascals (kPa). This must be in accordance with the precision of the manometer (e.g. 6,3 × 10\n5\nPa or 630\xa0kPa and not 6,33 × 10\n5\nPa or 633\xa0kPa for a class 1 manometer with a full-scale reading of 1\xa0000\xa0kPa).\nWhen the measure of temperature is other than 20\xa0°C, this must be corrected by multiplying the pressure measured by an appropriate coefficient (see Table 1).\nTable 1\nRatio of Paph\n20\nexcess pressure in a sparkling or semi-sparkling wine at 20\xa0°C with the Paph\nt\nexcess pressure at a temperature t\n°C\n0\n1,85\n1\n1,80\n2\n1,74\n3\n1,68\n4\n1,64\n5\n1,59\n6\n1,54\n7\n1,50\n8\n1,45\n9\n1,40\n10\n1,36\n11\n1,32\n12\n1,28\n13\n1,24\n14\n1,20\n15\n1,16\n16\n1,13\n17\n1,09\n18\n1,06\n19\n1,03\n20\n1,00\n21\n0,97\n22\n0,95\n23\n0,93\n24\n0,91\n25\n0,88\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0CONTROLLING THE RESULTS\nMethod of direct determination of physical parameters (Type I criteria method)\nChecking the aphrometers\nAphrometers must be checked regularly (at least once a year).\nThis is done using a calibration bench. This allows the manometer for testing to be compared with a high-quality reference manometer measured by national standards, mounted in parallel. The check compares the values indicated by the two apparatuses for rising, and then falling, levels of pressure. If there is a difference, the manometer can be regulated using an adjustment screw.\nLaboratories and authorised organisations are all equipped with calibration benches; they are also available from manometer manufacturers.’'}]}"

Whereas, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/90 (3), lays down detailed rules for the application of the compensation mechanism to imports of fruit and vegetables from Spain and Portugal,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 152 and Article 318 of the Act of Accession, a compensation mechanism is to be introduced on imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, hereinafter referred to as the 'Community of Ten', of fruit and  vegetables from Spain and Portugal for which a reference price is fixed with regard to third countries; whereas, Community offer prices for cherries coming from Spain and Portugal should be fixed only during the period where reference prices are fixed  with regard to third countries, namely from 21 May up to and including 10 August;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 152 (2) (a) and 318 (1) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each Member State of the Community of Ten, plus  transport and packaging costs incurred by the products from the production regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and taking account of developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetable sector; whereas the  abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied in  respect of third countries;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal variations in prices, the marketing year should be divided into one or more periods and a Community offer price should be fixed for each of them;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulations (EEC) No 3709/89 and No (EEC) 3648/90, the producer prices to be used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product defined by its commercial characteristics  recorded on the representative market or markets located in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter and which  meet Quality Class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared  with the normal fluctuations recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive variations with respect of normal price fluctuations, it shall not be taken into account;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices being fixed for cherries for the period 21 May to 10 August 1991 at the levels set out hereinafter;

Whereas in application of the provisions of Article 5 (3) of Directive 91/494/EEC it is necessary to determine in particular the methodologies for the performance of virological tests for Newcastle disease; whereas in this regard it is appropriate to provide for details of the sampling procedure, the procedure for carrying out the tests and the interpretation of the test results;

Sampling At leat 60 samples comprising at least 30 cloacal swabs and 30 tracheal swabs shall be taken from  each flock. At least 60 birds shall be sampled. The samples shall be taken five days before  slaughter, and transported, chilled, but not frozen to the National Newcastle Disease Laboratory  for testing.\n\n2.  Treatment of samples Not more than five samples of each type may be pooled. Swabs should be placed in sufficient  antibiotic medium to ensure full immersion and after agitation left for about two hours at ambient  temperature (or longer periods at 4  °C) and then clarified by centrifugation (e.g. 800 to 1  000   ×  g for 10 minutes).\n\n3.  Antibiotic medium A typical example for cloacal swabs is: 10  000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 0,25  mg/ml gentamycin and 5  000 units/ml mycostatin in phosphate buffered saline at pH 7,2 to 7,4. 50  ìg/ml oxytetracycline may be added. The antibiotic concentrations can be reduced five-fold for  tracheal swabs. It is imperative when making the medium that the pH is checked after the addition  of the antibiotics and re-adjusted.\n\n4.  Virus isolation in embryonated fowls' eggs The clarified supernatent fluid should be inoculated in 0,2 ml amounts into the allantoic cavity of  each of a minimum of four embryonated, fowls' eggs which have been incubated for 8 to 11 days.  Ideally, these eggs should be obtained from a specific pathogen free flock, but when this is  impracticable it is acceptable to use eggs obtained from a flock shown to be free of antibodies to  Newcastle disease virus. The inoculated eggs are held at 37  °C and candled daily. Eggs with dead  or dying embryos as they arise, and all remaining eggs four days after inoculation, should be  chilled to 4  °C and the allantoic-amniotic fluids tested for haemagglutination activity.\n\n5.  Interpretation The test should be regarded as negative if no haemagglutination activity is detected and no virus  is isolated. Isolation of a Newcastle disease virus means that the flock is treated as a suspect  flock and subjected to the requirements of Article 4 of Council Directive 92/66/EEC  (1). If the  virus proves to be of vaccinal origin, the sampling and testing should be repeated.""}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 8547 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1322/2002(5), should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2284/2002 of 19 December 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWith the exception of the quantity of 8547 tonnes provided for in the Annex, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 20 December 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(2) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(3) OJ L 154, 15.6.1976, p. 11.\n\n(4) OJ L 117, 24.5.1995, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ L 194, 23.7.2002, p. 22.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 19 December 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\n\nR01 Switzerland, Liechtenstein, communes of Livigno and Campione d\'Italia.\n\nR02 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Ex-Spanish Sahara, Cyprus, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, West Bank/Gaza Strip, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine, Kazakstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nR03 Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Bermuda, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, A40 except the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Turks and Caicos Islands, A11 except Suriname, Guyana, Madagascar.'}]}"

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 18 September 1985
concerning the on-the-spot inspections to be carried out in respect of the intra-Community trade in fresh meat
(85/446/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (1) as last amended by Directive 85/235/EEC (2), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
Whereas the Commission has to determine the general provisions laying down the conditions for implementing the on-the-spot checks as foreseen in Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 64/433/EEC;
Whereas, to this end, routine checks should be written into programmes drawn up after consultation with the Member States concerned and after an exchange of views in the framework of the Standing Veterinary Committee;
Whereas furthermore Article 8 (3) of the abovementioned Directive laid down that the Commission has the duty, if so requested by a Member State, to have a slaughterhouse or cutting plant which has been officially approved by another Member State inspected by one or more experts to establish whether the conditions governing such approval are observed; whereas this inspection arises when the Member State requesting it considers that such conditions are not being observed by the establishment in question, and when it is clear that the Member States involved cannot agree on the way to resolve the situation;
Whereas the Commission is responsible for appointing the experts from its own services as well as from among those proposed by the Member States on the basis of their qualifications;
Whereas, in view of the particular importance for intra-Community trade, from the health protection and economic standpoints, of any questions raised relating to an establishment, the inspection should be made as promptly as possible;
Whereas the Commission should provide the experts with a document authorizing them to make an inspection, so that the latter may justify their intervention, in particular in relation to the management of the establishment which has been called in question;
Whereas the Commission has to inform the Member State responsible for approving the establishment which has been called in question that an inspection is to be made of that establishment, in order that the Member State may take any appropriate steps and may ensure in particular that the establishment and the official veterinary services afford the experts all the facilities they need to carry out such investigations as the latter consider necessary;
Whereas, since the national experts will be acting at the request of the Commission, their travel and subsistence expenses must be reimbursed in accordance with the rates appropriate to persons outside the Commission who are called upon to act as experts;
Whereas it is necessary, after each check, to ensure that Member States are informed rapidly of the results obtained;
Whereas it is equally necessary to provide for a rapid procedure allowing, whenever required, for the adoption of Community decisions, particularly where checks have shown a serious risk to public health or when it is proved that measures regarded as essential following these checks have not been taken;
Whereas Article 9 (2) of the abovementioned Directive provides for a re-examination of the provisions of that Article before 1 January 1988; whereas the provisions of Chapter II of this Decision should remain applicable only until that date;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,","{'title': '85/446/EEC: Commission Decision of 18 September 1985 concerning the on-the-spot inspections to be carried out in respect of the intra-Community trade in fresh meat', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThis Decision lays down the general provisions for the application of Articles 8 (3) and 9 of Directive 64/433/EEC, hereinafter called 'the Directive'.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nRoutine on-the-spot checks""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for the adoption of measures of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, inter alia, by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument with new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (6) concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) The Commission should be empowered to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of Directive 2003/6/EC in order to take account of technical developments in financial markets and ensure the uniform application of that Directive. Those measures are designed to adapt definitions; elaborate upon or supplement the provisions of that Directive by technical modalities for disclosure of inside information, insider lists, reporting of managerial and suspicious transactions to competent authorities; and present the research in a fair manner. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2003/6/EC by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) Directive 2003/6/EC provides for a time restriction concerning the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their statement concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament’s wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the co-decision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time limit. The European Parliament and the Council also declared that they would make sure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that provide for a time limit on the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the provision establishing that time restriction in Directive 2003/6/EC should be deleted.
(6) The Commission should, at regular intervals, evaluate the functioning of the provisions concerning the implementing powers conferred on it in order to allow the European Parliament and the Council to determine whether the extent of those powers and the procedural requirements imposed on the Commission are appropriate and ensure both efficiency and democratic accountability.
(7) Directive 2003/6/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 30 December 2004
concerning the financing of an external evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy and the financing of a study analysing the costs of, and conditions for, a livestock epidemics risk financing instrument in the EU
(2005/39/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision SEC/2004/120 of 11 March 2004 on the Internal Rules on the implementation of the general budget of the European Communities, and in particular Article 15 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Decision 90/424/EEC the Community is to undertake or assist the Member States in undertaking the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.
(2) In view of the recommendations at the international conference on control and prevention of food-and-mouth disease (December 2001), new dilemmas concerning the control of highly contagious animal diseases, and the possible need for new financing schemes for the consequences of these outbreaks, there is a need for further review.
(3) In order to bring this review forward, the following two actions should be carried out in the context of a work programme.
(4) Firstly, an evaluation of the Community expenditure programmes, as a means of accounting for the management of allocated funds and as a way of promoting a lesson learning culture throughout the management, with an increased focus on results-based management should be carried out.
(5) This external and independent evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy (CAHP) based on its financial aspects should assist the Commission services in defining adequate and impact based policy options for the future.
(6) Secondly, a study (pilot project in the sense of Article 49(2) of the Financial Regulation) should analyse the costs of, and the conditions for, a livestock epidemics risk financing instrument in the EU, following the European Parliament request. The goal of this study will be to examine the feasibility and to evaluate the cost of alternative risk financing instruments options with a view to determining potential impact on the national and EU budgets and sustainable levels of national support for direct losses.
(7) The results of this study could form a basis to consider on the one hand the harmonisation of EU financing schemes, with a view at least to put farmers in an equal position across the EU, and on the other hand to analyse the future of the veterinary fund in the enlarged Community.
(8) According to Article 15 of the Internal Rules of 2004 for the execution of the budget, an annual work programme may also be considered to be the financing decision provided that it constitutes a sufficiently detailed framework, and the evaluation, study and review foreseen in this decision constitute such a framework.
(9) Appropriations which may be used without a basic act, in accordance with Article 49(2)(a) of the Financial Regulation, must nevertheless be covered by a decision taken by the Commission offering an equivalent framework.
(10) Therefore, this decision should constitute a framework equivalent to a financing decision within the meaning of Article 75(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (2).
(11) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '21.1.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 19/76', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 December 2004\nconcerning the financing of an external evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy and the financing of a study analysing the costs of, and conditions for, a livestock epidemics risk financing instrument in the EU\n(2005/39/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nDECIDES:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Decision 90/424/EEC the Community is to undertake or assist the Member States in undertaking the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.\n\n((2)) In view of the recommendations at the international conference on control and prevention of food-and-mouth disease (December 2001), new dilemmas concerning the control of highly contagious animal diseases, and the possible need for new financing schemes for the consequences of these outbreaks, there is a need for further review.\n\n((3)) In order to bring this review forward, the following two actions should be carried out in the context of a work programme.\n\n((4)) Firstly, an evaluation of the Community expenditure programmes, as a means of accounting for the management of allocated funds and as a way of promoting a lesson learning culture throughout the management, with an increased focus on results-based management should be carried out.\n\n((5)) This external and independent evaluation of the Community Animal Health Policy (CAHP) based on its financial aspects should assist the Commission services in defining adequate and impact based policy options for the future.\n\n((6)) Secondly, a study (pilot project in the sense of Article 49(2) of the Financial Regulation) should analyse the costs of, and the conditions for, a livestock epidemics risk financing instrument in the EU, following the European Parliament request.

Whereas:

(2) The Member States have to declare to the Commission all expenditure they have paid under their own responsibility to the beneficiaries prior to the approval of a rural development programme in the first declaration of expenditure following that approval. The same rule applies mutatis mutandis in case of amendment of a rural development programme.
(3) For the purposes of accounting it is necessary to clarify that the declaration concerning expenditure paid by the paying agencies prior to the approval of a rural development programme or prior to the amendment of a rural development programme should correspond to entire periods as specified in the first subparagraph of Article 22(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 908/2014. Furthermore, all expenditure paid by paying agencies during the period in which the approval of a rural development programme or its amendment takes place should be declared by the deadline set for the corresponding period in that Article.
(4) It is also necessary to clarify that the rule laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 22(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 908/2014 should not apply for financing plan adjustments as referred to in Article 23(2) of that Regulation.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/429
of 13 March 2015
setting out the modalities to be followed for the application of the charging for the cost of noise effects
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area (1), in particular Article 31(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The White Paper ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system’ (2) indicated that 10 % of the European population is exposed to significant noise pollution from rail transport, in particular freight. Noise is a localised externality, affecting people living close to railway lines. Its reduction is the most cost-effective at the source, where the noise is produced. The replacement of cast iron brake blocks with composite brake blocks can bring noise reductions of up to 10 dB. Therefore the support of the retrofitting of wagons with the most economically viable low-noise braking technology available should be encouraged and pursued.
(2) This Regulation aims at incentivising the retrofitting by allowing the reimbursement of relevant costs linked with installation of composite brake blocks.
(3) Article 31(5) of Directive 2012/34/EU empowered the Commission to adopt implementing measures setting out the modalities to be followed for the application of the charging for the cost of noise effects including its duration of application and enabling the differentiation of infrastructure charges to take into account, where appropriate, the sensitivity of the area affected, in particular in terms of the size of population affected and the train composition with an impact on the level of noise emissions (‘noise-differentiated track access charges’ or ‘NDTAC’).
(4) This Regulation sets out such modalities and provides an appropriate legal framework on the basis of which a scheme establishing NDTAC (‘the scheme’) should be introduced and applied by the infrastructure managers. This legal framework should guarantee to the railway undertakings, wagon keepers and other stakeholders a legal security and incentives to retrofit their wagons. Therefore the modalities set out by this Regulation cover the duration of the scheme, the level of incentives and the related arrangements.
(5) For the purpose of providing the necessary expertise and assistance, the Commission established in 2011 a NDTAC expert working group. The group consisted of representatives of interested Member States, infrastructure managers, railway undertakings, wagon keepers and civil society, and provided valuable input.
(6) Member States should be free to decide whether the infrastructure manager should modify the infrastructure charges, in accordance with this Regulation, in order to take into account the cost of noise effects.
(7) Wagons which comply with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1304/2014 (3) on the technical specifications of interoperability relating to the subsystem ‘rolling stock — noise’ and its subsequent modifications (‘TSI Noise’), should be considered ‘silent’. Wagons which do not comply with TSI Noise should be considered ‘noisy’. If, during a renewal or upgrading of a wagon, the latter is equipped with certified composite brake blocks and no noise sources are added to the wagon under assessment, then it should be assumed that the requirements of TSI Noise are met.
(8) There are wagons that cannot be retrofitted with composite brake blocks due to their technical characteristics. These wagons should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.
(9) In order to preserve the competitiveness of the railway sector, the scheme should take the form of a minimum mandatory discount or a bonus for railway undertakings using retrofitted wagons. For the same purpose administrative procedures should be kept to the necessary minimum.
(10) In order to take into account the sensitivity of the area affected by the noise, in particular in terms of the size of population affected, infrastructure managers should have a possibility to introduce a surcharge (constituting a malus) for railway undertakings using noisy trains. Malus can only be introduced where bonus is also introduced. The level of malus can vary on different railway lines and sections for duly justified reasons, depending in particular on the noise exposure of the affected population. In order not to affect the overall competitiveness of the railway sector, the malus should be of a limited value and in any case not higher than the bonus. However, if charging of cost of noise is applied to road freight transport in accordance with Union law, such limitation should not apply.
(11) The result of effective noise reduction due to retrofitting can be only noticeable when almost all wagons in a train are silent. Moreover, a better noise performance beyond the required minimum and innovation in noise reduction should be promoted. Therefore additional bonuses for ‘silent’ trains and ‘very quiet’ rolling stock should be allowed.
(12) As one of the main objectives of this Regulation is to provide incentives for a fast retrofitting, the duration of the scheme in relation to bonus should be limited in time and at the same time last long enough to provide sufficient financial support. Therefore the scheme should start to apply as soon as possible and finish to apply in 2021. However, Member States should have the possibility to decide whether the infrastructure managers should apply the scheme after the proposed starting date. The effects of schemes existing at the date of the entry into force of this Regulation should be recognised and taken into account by providing for appropriate transitional provisions. The application of such schemes should in no case result in discrimination between railway undertakings.
(13) If the progress with retrofitting is not satisfactory, Member States should be allowed to apply malus after the end of the duration of the scheme under the condition that a similar measure is applied to the road freight transport sector. The design of this malus should be consistent with the principles of internalisation of external costs of noise for all freight transport modes, in particular road transport.
(14) As wagon keepers are usually in the position to retrofit the wagons while railway undertakings would benefit from the bonus, the incentives should be passed on to those who bear the costs of retrofitting.
(15) Various studies have assessed the retrofitting costs and necessary incentive that would enable pursuing the retrofitting in connection with other funding possibilities. Based on the impact assessment support study of the Commission, the minimum harmonised level of bonus should be set at EUR 0,0035 per axle-km. Such an amount of bonus should incentivise retrofitting a wagon running 45 000 km per year during the period of 6 years by covering 50 % of relevant costs. As it is considered that running a wagon with composite brake blocks leads to higher operating costs and given that a wagon may run in practice less than 45 000 km per year, the amount of bonus could be increased to take this into account.
(16) In order to increase the speed of retrofitting and minimise the risk of possible negative consequences for the competitiveness of the rail sector, wagon keepers and railway undertakings should be encouraged to take advantage of the European public funding possibilities for retrofitting provided by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) establishing the Connecting Europe Facility. For the same purpose the Member States which decide that the infrastructure managers apply the scheme should be encouraged to make relevant national funds available.
(17) In order to ensure non-discriminatory conditions for all railway undertakings and prevent payment of bonuses for the use of wagons which are not entitled to benefit from them, infrastructure managers should receive data regarding the relevant noise characteristics of wagons. In order to reduce administrative burden, existing registers and other tools, where available, should be used for that purpose.
(18) Infrastructure managers applying the scheme should cooperate in order to simplify and harmonise procedures relating to the operation of the scheme with a view to reducing administrative and financial burdens for railway undertakings.
(19) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 2012/34/EU regarding the financing of infrastructure, the equilibrium of income and expenditure of the infrastructure manager and equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent access to infrastructure.
(20) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee referred to in Article 62(3) of Directive 2012/34/EU,","{'header': '14.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 70/36', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/429\nof 13 March 2015\nsetting out the modalities to be followed for the application of the charging for the cost of noise effects\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The White Paper ‘Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area — Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system’(2)indicated that 10 % of the European population is exposed to significant noise pollution from rail transport, in particular freight.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/59/EEC of 29 June 1992 on general product safety(1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission adopted, on 7 December 1999, Decision 1999/815/EC(2) based on Article 9 of Directive 92/59/EEC requiring the Member States to prohibit the placing on the market of toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth by children under three years of age, made of soft PVC containing one or more of the substances di-iso-nonyl phthalate (DINP), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), di-iso-decyl phthalate (DIDP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBP).
(2) The validity of Decision 1999/815/EC was limited to three months, in accordance with the provision of Article 11(2) of Directive 92/59/EEC; therefore, the validity of the Decision was to expire on 8 March 2000.
(3) Article 11(2) of Directive 92/59/EEC states that the validity of the measures adopted on the basis of Article 9 of the said Directive is limited to three months, but may be prolonged under the same procedure foreseen for the adoption of these measures.
(4) When adopting Decision 1999/815/EC it was foreseen to prolong its validity if necessary. The validity of the measures adopted under Decision 1999/815/EC on the basis of Article 9 of Directive 92/59/EEC was prolonged under Commission Decisions 2000/217/EC and 2000/381/EC for an additional period of three months each time, in accordance with the provision of Article 11(2) of the said Directive; therefore the validity of the Decision is to expire on 6 September 2000.
(5) The reasons which motivated Decision 1999/815/EC and its prolongation under Decisions 2000/217/EC and 2000/381/EC are still valid and it is therefore necessary to maintain the prohibition of the placing on the market of the products considered.
(6) Certain Member States have implemented Decision 1999/815/EC, as modified by Decisions 2000/217/EC and 2000/381/EC, by measures applicable until 6 September 2000. Therefore it is necessary to ensure that the validity of these measures is prolonged.
(7) It is therefore necessary to prolong the validity of Decision 1999/815/EC for a third time in order to ensure that all the Member States maintain the prohibition provided for by that Decision; according to Article 11(2) of Directive 92/59/EEC the validity may be prolonged for a period of three months.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

(1) Article 30 of Annex II to Decision 91/482/EEC concerning the definition of the concept of ""originating products"" and methods of administrative cooperation provides that derogations from the rules of origin may be adopted where the development of existing industries or the creation of new industries in a country or territory justifies them.
(2) On 18 May 2001 the French Government has requested a derogation from the rule of origin in the Annex II to Decision 91/482/EEC, in respect of an annual quantity of 1100 tonnes of frozen fillets of cod, 60 tonnes of frozen fillets of redfish, 11 tonnes of frozen fillets of plaice and 119 tonnes of frozen fillets of halibut, exported from Saint Pierre and Miquelon during a period of five years.
(3) The French Government has based its request on the current shortfall in the sources of supply of other originating fish.
(4) The requested derogation is justified under the terms of the provisions concerned in Article 30 of Annex II to Decision 91/482/EEC, notably with regard to the substantial nature of the processing carried out in Saint Pierre and Miquelon, because the derogation is essential for the preservation of the processing plant in question which employs large numbers and because there would be no serious injury to an established Community industry, provided that certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration are respected.
(5) Since the validity of Decision 91/482/EEC was extended until 1 December 2001 by Decision 2001/161/EC, an appropriate provision should be included to ensure the validity of the derogation beyond 1 December 2001, in case a new decision on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Community is adopted before that date or in case the validity of Decision 91/482/EEC is further extended.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'title': '2001/657/EC: Commission Decision of 6 August 2001 derogating from the definition of the concept of ""originating products"" to take account of the special situation of Saint Pierre and Miquelon with regard to frozen fillets of cod, redfish, plaice and halibut of CN code 030420 (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2001) 2462)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from the provisions of Annex II to Decision 91/482/EEC, frozen fillets of cod, redfish, plaice and halibut falling within CN code ex 0304 20 processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon from non-originating fish shall be regarded as originating in Saint Pierre and Miquelon in accordance with the terms of this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe derogation provided for in Article 1 shall apply to the quantities shown in the Annex to this Decision which are imported into the Community from Saint Pierre and Miquelon during the period of 1 September 2001 to 31 August 2006.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThe quantities referred to in the Annex shall be managed by the Commission, which shall take all administrative action it deems advisable for their efficient management.\n\nWhere an importer presents, in a Member State, a declaration of entry for free circulation, including an application for the benefit of this Decision, the Member State shall, if the declaration has been accepted by the customs authorities, notify the Commission of its wish to draw the amount corresponding to its requirements.\n\nApplications to draw, showing the date of acceptance of declarations, shall be transmitted to the Commission without delay.\n\nWithdrawals shall be granted by the Commission in order of date of acceptance of declarations of entry for free circulation by the Member States' customs authorities, provided that the available balance permits.\n\nIf a Member State fails to use a withdrawal it shall return it, as soon as possible, to the appropriate quota.\n\nIf requests exceed the available balance of a given quota, quantities shall be allocated on a pro rata basis.

(2) In December 2004, the Commission received information from South Africa indicating that the disease situation in ratite flocks had improved. However, that information did not allow the Commission to conclude that the disease had been effectively controlled.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 47(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 47(1) and Article 53 of Directive 2006/43/EC, as of 29 June 2008, competent authorities of Member States may allow the transfer of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of a third country only if the authorities have been declared adequate by the Commission and there are reciprocal working arrangements between them and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. It therefore needs to be determined which competent authorities of third countries are adequate for the purpose of transfer of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of a third country.
(2) A transfer of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of a third country reflects a substantial public interest related to carrying out independent public oversight. Accordingly, any such transfer by the competent authorities of Member States should be made solely for the purpose of the exercise of the competences of public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms by the competent authorities of the third country concerned. The persons employed or formerly employed by competent authorities of the third country that receive the information are subject to obligations of professional secrecy.
(3) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (2) applies to the processing of personal data carried out pursuant to this Directive. Accordingly, where a transfer of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of the third countries below involves the disclosure of personal data, it should always be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC. Member States should ensure, through working arrangements in accordance with Chapter IV of Directive 95/46/EC between their competent authorities and the competent authorities of third countries that the latter would not further disclose personal data comprised in transferred audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms without the prior agreement of the competent authorities of the Member States concerned. The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in respect of the present Decision.
(4) The adequacy of competent authorities of a third country should be assessed in the light of the cooperation requirements pursuant to Article 36 of Directive 2006/43/EC or essentially equivalent functional results. In particular, the adequacy should be assessed in the light of the competences exercised by the competent authorities of the third country concerned, the safeguards against breaching professional secrecy and confidentiality rules implemented by them and their ability under their laws and regulations to cooperate with the competent authorities of Member States.
(5) As auditors and audit firms of Community companies which have issued securities in Canada, Japan or Switzerland, or which form part of a group issuing statutory consolidated accounts in those countries are regulated under the domestic laws of those countries, it should be decided whether the competent authorities of Member States may transfer audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of those countries solely for the purposes of the exercise of their competences of public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms.
(6) Adequacy assessments for the purposes of Article 47 of Directive 2006/43/EC have been carried out with respect to the competent authorities of Canada, Japan and Switzerland. Adequacy decisions should be taken on the basis of those assessments with respect to those authorities.
(7) The Canadian Public Accountability Board has competence in the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. It implements adequate safeguards banning and sanctioning disclosure by its current or former employees of confidential information to any third person or authority. It would use the transferred audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms solely for purposes related to the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. Under the laws and regulations of Canada, it may transfer audit working papers or other documents held by Canadian auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of any Member State. On this basis, the Canadian Public Accountability Board should be declared adequate for the purpose of Article 47(1) of Directive 2006/43/EC.
(8) The Financial Services Agency of Japan and the Certified Public Accountants and Auditing Oversight Board within the Financial Services Agency of Japan have competence in the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. This Decision should only cover the competences of the Financial Services Agency to investigate auditors and audit firms. The Financial Services Agency of Japan and the Certified Public Accountants and Auditing Oversight Board of Japan implement adequate safeguards banning and sanctioning disclosure by their current or former employees of confidential information to any third person or authority and would use the transferred audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms solely for purposes related to the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. Under the laws and regulations of Japan, they may transfer audit working papers or other documents held by Japanese auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of any Member State. On this basis, the Financial Services Agency of Japan and the Certified Public Accountants and Auditing Oversight Board of Japan should be declared adequate for the purpose of Article 47(1) of Directive 2006/43/EC.
(9) The Federal Audit Oversight Authority of Switzerland has competence in the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. It implements adequate safeguards banning and sanctioning disclosure by its current or former employees of confidential information to any third person or authority. It would use the transferred audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms solely for purposes related to the public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations of auditors and audit firms. Under the laws and regulations of Switzerland, it may transfer audit working papers or other documents held by Swiss auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of any Member State. On this basis, the Federal Audit Oversight Authority of Switzerland should be declared adequate for the purpose of Article 47(1) of Directive 2006/43/EC.
(10) Transfer of audit working papers should include access to or transmission to the authorities declared adequate under this Decision of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms, upon prior agreement of the competent authorities of Member States, and access to or transmission of such papers by the competent authorities of Member States to those authorities. As a consequence, statutory auditors and audit firms should not be allowed to grant access, nor to transmit audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to those authorities under other conditions than the ones set out in this Decision and in Article 47 of Directive 2006/43/EC, for example on the basis of consent of the statutory auditor, the audit firms or the client company.
(11) This Decision should be without prejudice to the cooperation arrangements referred to in Article 25(4) of Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and amending Directive 2001/34/EC (3).
(12) As this Decision is taken in the context of the transitional period granted to certain third country auditors and audit firms by Commission Decision 2008/627/EC of 29 July 2008 concerning a transitional period for audit activities of certain third country auditors and audit entities (4), this Decision should not pre-empt any final equivalence decisions that the Commission may adopt pursuant to Article 46 of Directive 2006/43/EC.
(13) The present Decision aims at facilitating effective cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and those of Canada, Japan and Switzerland to allow the exercise of their functions of public oversight, external quality assurance and investigations and, at the same time, to protect the rights of the parties concerned. Member States should communicate to the Commission the working arrangements concluded with those authorities to allow the Commission to assess if cooperation takes place in accordance with Article 47 of the Directive 2006/43/EC.
(14) The ultimate objective of cooperation with Canada, Japan and Switzerland in audit oversight is to reach mutual reliance on each other’s oversight systems where transfers of audit working papers would be exceptional. The mutual reliance would be based on the equivalence of Community and those countries’ auditor oversight systems.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 48(1) of Directive 2006/43/EC,","{'header': '6.2.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 35/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 5 February 2010\non the adequacy of the competent authorities of certain third countries pursuant to Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2010) 590)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/64/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 47(1) and Article 53 of Directive 2006/43/EC, as of 29 June 2008, competent authorities of Member States may allow the transfer of audit working papers or other documents held by statutory auditors or audit firms to the competent authorities of a third country only if the authorities have been declared adequate by the Commission and there are reciprocal working arrangements between them and the competent authorities of the Member States concerned.

COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 21 May 2013
rejecting the proposal for a Council implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and terminating the expiry review proceeding concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Indonesia and Malaysia, in so far as the proposal would impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand
(2013/226/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Articles 9(4) and 11(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission, after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) Anti-dumping measures against imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) originating in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand have been in force since 2000, having been renewed in 2007. In parallel, countervailing measures on PET from India have been in place since 2000, and trade defence measures are also in place on imports from China, Iran, Pakistan and UAE.
(2) The Expiry Review of these anti-dumping measures was initiated on 24 February 2012. An Expiry Review of the countervailing measures against imports of PET from India was also initiated on 24 February 2012. The Council has accepted the Commission’s proposal to maintain these countervailing measures.
(3) According to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (the Basic anti-dumping Regulation), measures will expire after a period unless expiry of a measure would be likely to lead to a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury. Article 11(2) also says that the likelihood of recurrence may be indicated by evidence:
(a) of continued dumping and injury; or
(b) that the removal of injury is partly or solely due to the existence of measures; or
(c) that the circumstances of the exporters, or market conditions, are such that they would indicate the likelihood of further injurious dumping.
(4) The Council agrees that there is no likelihood that Indonesian or Malaysian exporting producers will resume exporting injurious quantities at dumped prices to the Union market in the short or medium term should measures be repealed.
(5) However, the Council view is that the case has not been made that the removal of anti-dumping measures against India, Taiwan and Thailand would be likely to lead to continuation or resumption of injurious dumping. It further concludes that the reimposition of measures would clearly be against the overall Union interest.
(6) The Council is of the opinion that 13 years has in this instance been enough to allow European industry to adapt to the global competition and recover substantially. In addition, the main export markets for PET are growing and the global demand for PET-packaged products is likely to expand further as the world economy recovers.
(7) The Council’s assessment, based on the evidence in the proposal, is that the EU industry is not currently suffering material injury.
(8) The Council has also examined whether the recurrence of material injury would be likely if the measures were allowed to lapse. The Council’s assessment is that this would not be likely to happen. Productivity has increased in the period covered by the Expiry Review. EU industry consistently holds over 70 % of the EU market and prices, profitability, return on investment and cash flow figures are significantly improving. The trends show that the market developments cannot be regarded as temporary.
(9) These developments would allow EU producers to compete with the imports from the countries concerned without leading to recurrence of material injury. In addition, import prices have increased significantly during the last number of years and thus price pressure is diminishing.
(10) Imports from the countries concerned are not significant in terms of their share of the EU market (still below 4 % in RIP) and in relation to imports from other countries and EU producers sales. In addition, their prices are in line with those of the EU sales and the other imports. Further, according to the data presented, in terms of market shares the measures have been more beneficial to third country producers than the Union industry.
(11) The market shares of both Taiwan and Thailand are close to zero. Given that the volumes are so small, the reliability of claims about dumping are likely to be subject to a large margin of error.
(12) Where there are imports, import prices have been rising strongly. Indian prices increased 29 %, Taiwan prices increased 27 % and Thailand prices increased 32 % over the period considered. In addition, in all three cases, no price undercutting was found. The Council’s assessment is that it is therefore not possible to justify a conclusion that these imports are causing injury. The Council’s assessment is also that it has not been demonstrated that injurious dumping by imports from the countries concerned would be likely to recur once the measures lapsed.
(13) Although there is some overcapacity in the countries concerned, the Council is not persuaded that those unused capacities would be directed to the EU. Demand is growing in most of the major markets.
(14) The price level in the EU compared with other countries is higher than in other major markets because these long-lasting measures are in force. Without the measures prices would tend to normalise vis-à-vis other countries. Trade defence measures in third countries are unlikely to deflect significant trade towards the EU because these countries are not the world’s main consumers of PET. No information has been provided on the existence or otherwise of trade defence measures in other major PET markets such as the US and Japan. Therefore the Council believes that although there could be an increase of imports after the lapse of the measures, this increase would not be significant.
(15) The Council’s assessment is that no persuasive evidence has been provided on a number of factors which seem relevant to any assessment of whether removal of duties would lead to a resumption of injurious dumping. These include:
(a) Demand trends in third countries: in the case of Taiwan, for example, third country exports account for about 60 % of production capacity. This suggests that future demand trends in these countries are relevant to the assessment.
(b) Transport costs and other factors affecting profitability: if third country export markets are closer to the exporter than the EU market — East Asia is a significant market — this will affect transport costs and hence profitability of export sales and hence the relative attractiveness of the EU market.
(16) Other factors point to the likelihood that removal of measures will not lead to a resumption of dumping which causes material injury to the Union Industry. Continued anti-subsidy measures against India and anti-dumping measures against China and other countries will continue to provide some protection for the Union Industry. The past pattern of trade in this market also suggests that any rise in exports from India, Thailand and Taiwan could partly or wholly displace third country imports rather than EU production.
(17) The Council’s assessment is that material injury is unlikely to recur if the measures are allowed to lapse. Therefore the Council finds that the criteria for continuing the measures according to Article 11(2) of the Basic Regulation are not met.
(18) Article 21(1) of the Basic Regulation provides that a determination as to whether the Union interest calls for intervention is to be based on an appreciation of all the various interests taken as a whole.
(19) PET prices are determined by a number of factors, but it is clear the anti-dumping measures have increased the costs to the user industry. Many users are bottlers and SMEs operating on tight margins and they have been seriously affected by high PET prices in recent years because PET represents a decisive proportion of their production costs. The impact of the high costs has been biggest on smaller bottling companies who have not been able to pass the increased prices on to retailers and final consumers due to low negotiating power. Many are heavily loss-making and have lost a significant number of employees. The proposal recognises the deteriorating situation of users and the fact that EU PET prices are higher than in other major markets. However, in the Council’s opinion, it has not been demonstrated that the measures in question are not a contributing factor to the relatively high Union PET prices.
(20) The EU PET industry is now highly concentrated and increasingly vertically integrated. It is profitable and should be able to be internationally competitive.
(21) The accumulation of measures combined with the increasing integration of PET producers and PET-packaging companies in the EU creates a situation in which there is a lack of a level playing field for independent PET-packaging companies which are subject to PET at the highest prices worldwide (given the horizontal effect existing on PET prices), while their main competitors in third countries have access to PET at lower prices.
(22) PET users have very limited sources of supply outside the EU, because measures are also in force against imports originating in other third countries.
(23) The Council concludes that it is clearly not in the interest of the Union to extend the measures as the costs to importers, users and consumers are disproportionate to the benefits for the Union industry.","{'header': '23.5.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 136/12', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 21 May 2013\nrejecting the proposal for a Council implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and terminating the expiry review proceeding concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Indonesia and Malaysia, in so far as the proposal would impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand\n(2013/226/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nINJURY\n\nRECURRENCE OF INJURY\n\nUNION INTEREST\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe proposal for a Council implementing regulation imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephtalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 and terminating the expiry review proceeding concerning imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in Indonesia and Malaysia is rejected, in so far as the proposal would impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyethylene terephthalate originating in India, Taiwan and Thailand.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe review proceeding concerning imports of polyethylene terephthalate having a viscosity number of 78\xa0ml/g or higher, according to ISO standard 1628-5, currently falling within CN code 3907\xa060\xa020  and originating in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand is terminated.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Whereas precise definitions are required in order to carry out the surveys provided for in Directive 93/23/EEC; whereas this requires the definition of the agricultural holdings covered by the survey; whereas the herd size classes and regions according to which the Member States draw up the survey results at regular intervals must also be determined; whereas a single definition of carcass weight is necessary for the drawing-up of slaughtering statistics;
Whereas, according to Directive 93/23/EEC, the Member States may, at their request, be authorized to carry out the April and August surveys in selected regions, on the understanding that these surveys cover at least 70 % of the pig population; whereas Member States whose pig population makes up only a small percentage of the overall population of the Community may, at their request, also be authorized to dispense altogether with the April and August surveys, or to use the regional breakdown for the final results of the April or August survey; whereas, finally, the Member States may, at their request, be authorized to use administrative sources instead of statistical surveys to determine the pig population and the prescribed breakdown by herd size classes for the final results of even-numbered years and/or for those of a given month of the year;
Whereas applications have been made by the Member States for the abovementioned types of authorization;
Whereas Commission Decision 76/805/EEC (2), as last amended by Decision 91/268/EEC (3), should be replaced;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 of 17 December 2007 on information provision and promotion measures for agricultural products on the internal market and in third countries (1), and in particular Articles 4, 5 and 15 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 (2) establishes rules for the drawing-up, selection, implementation, financing and checking of information provision and promotion measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 3/2008.
(2) The list of themes and products for which measures may be implemented on the internal market in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 is set out in Part A of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 and the list of products which may be covered by promotional measures in third countries in accordance with Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 is set out in Part A of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008. Those lists are to be revised every two years.
(3) The guidelines referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3/2008 are set out in Part B of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008.
(4) In the context of the crisis in the sheep meat sector and with a view to raising awareness in relation to sheep meat and its production and consumption, trade and inter-trade organisations from the sector should be given the opportunity to receive Union co-financing for information and promotion programmes for generic sheep meat of Union origin.
(5) Optional quality terms, introduced by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (3), constitute the second tier of quality systems which add value. They can be communicated on the internal market and refer to specific horizontal characteristics, with regard to one or more categories of products, farming methods or processing attributes which apply in specific areas. In order to complete the availability of promotion programmes on the internal market for all current quality schemes,products covered by the scheme for optional quality terms should be included as an eligible product, together with products covered by the schemes for protected designations of origin (PDO), protected geographical indications (PGI) or traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG).
(6) The reasons for granting the eligibility to poultrymeat are no longer valid, as the period following the avian influenza crisis has been sufficiently long for restoring consumer confidence. Therefore, references to poultrymeat should be deleted.
(7) In selecting third countries for inclusion in Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 501/2008, account is to be taken of the markets of third countries where there is actual or potential demand. Due to steadily growing consumption, potential for and interest in Union agricultural products as well as further outreach of Union programmes and cooperation projects, new countries and areas should be considered as eligible markets for the promotional programmes.
(8) In the context of the accession of Croatia to the Union on 1 July 2013, that country should be removed from the list of eligible third countries.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 501/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

It is therefore necessary to continue previous efforts to run campaigns by which the denominations, the products covered by the protected names and optional quality terms are made known to all potential actors in the chain of production, preparation, marketing and consumption of those products.\n2.\nGoals\nInformation and promotion campaigns should not focus on one or only a very limited number of product names, but rather on groups of names either of certain product categories or of products produced in one or several regions in one or several Member States.\nThe objectives of those campaigns should be to:\n—\nprovide comprehensive information on the content, the operation and the Union nature of the schemes and, in particular, on their effects on the commercial value of the products with protected names or optional quality terms which after registration benefit from the protection granted by those schemes,\n—\nenhance knowledge of the Union symbols for products covered by the schemes for PDO/PGI/TSG or optional quality terms among consumers, distributors and food professionals,\n—\nencourage producer/processor groups not yet taking part in those schemes to register the names of products which satisfy the basic requirements and to apply optional quality terms,\n—\nencourage producers and processors in the regions concerned but not yet taking part in the schemes to participate in the production of the products bearing the registered names by conforming to the approved specifications and inspection requirements laid down for the various protected names,\n—\nstimulate demand for the products concerned by informing consumers and distributors of the existence, significance and benefits of the schemes, and of the logos, the criteria for awarding designations, the relevant checks and controls, and the traceability system.\n3.\nTarget groups\n—\nProducers and processors\n—\nDistributors (supermarkets, wholesalers, retailers, caterers, canteens, restaurants)\n—\nConsumers and consumer associations\n—\nOpinion multipliers\n4.\nMain messages\n—\nThe products bearing the protected names have specific characteristics associated with their geographical origin; in the case of products with a PDO, the quality or characteristics of the products are essentially or exclusively linked to the particular geographical environment with its inherent natural and human factors. In the case of products with a PGI, the products possess a specific quality or reputation which can be attributed to the geographical origin; the geographical link must occur in at least one of the stages of production, processing or preparation\n—\nThe products with a TSG have specific characteristics associated with their particular traditional methods of production or with the use of traditional raw materials\n—\nThe Union symbols for PDO, PGI and TSG are symbols that are understood throughout the Union as designating products meeting specific conditions of production linked to their geographical origin or to their tradition and subject to inspection\n—\nOptional quality terms relate to a characteristic of one or more categories of products, or to a farming or processing attribute which applies in specific areas\n—\nThe use of the optional quality term adds value to the product as compared to products of a similar type\n—\nOptional quality terms have a Union’s dimension\n—\nThe presentation of some products covered by the schemes for PDO, PGI, TSG or optional quality terms as examples for the potential of successful commercial enhancement of products whose names are registered under the protection schemes\n—\nThese protection schemes support the Union cultural heritage, support the diversity of agricultural production and the maintenance of the countryside\n5.\nMain channels\n—\nInternet and other electronic means\n—\nPublic relations contacts with the media (specialised, women’s and culinary press)\n—\nContacts with consumer associations\n—\nPoint of sale information and demonstrations\n—\nAudiovisual media (specific television spots, etc.)\n—\nPrinted documents (leaflets, brochures, etc.)\n—\nParticipation at trade fairs and shows\n—\nInformation and training seminars and actions on the functioning of the Union schemes for PDO, PGI, TSG or optional quality terms\n6.\nDuration and scope of the programmes\nTwelve to 36 months, giving priority to multiannual programmes that set clear objectives and a strategy for each phase.’\n(iii)\nthe guidelines on ‘POULTRYMEAT’ are deleted\n(iv)\nthe following new guidelines on ‘SHEEP MEAT’ are added:\n‘SHEEP MEAT\n1.\nOverview of the situation\nThe sheep meat sector is a very fragile sector and experiencing a crisis: consumption, production and prices of sheep meat are in decline, whilst costs (introduction of electronic identification, feed prices, traditional production as transhumance) are on the rise.

Given the worsening profitability, many producers are obliged to leave the production, which can have negative consequence on the variety of the meat in the Union and on further abandonment of the countryside.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(1), and in particular Annex IV, part A, section I, points 16.2 and 16.4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex IV, part A section I, points 16.2, 16.3 and 16.4 of Directive 2000/29/EC, read with Article 6 thereof, require Member States to ban the introduction into their territory of fruits of Citrus L., Fortunella Swingle, Poncirus Raf., and their hybrids, originating in third countries where Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus), Cercospora angolensis Carv. et Mendes and Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) are known to occur.
(2) Under Commission Decision 98/83/EC(2), as last modified by Decision 1999/104/EC(3), certain third countries were recognised as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus), Cercospora angolensis Carv. et Mendes and Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) and certain areas were recognised as being free of those harmful organisms in third countries where they are known to occur.
(3) On the basis of information collected in the United States of America during a mission carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) in March 2000, and supplied by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, it appears that new infestations of Xanthomonas campestris, strains pathogenic to Citrus were detected in Broward, Hendry and Hillsborough Counties in Florida; therefore the said counties should be deleted from the list of areas recognised in Florida as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus).
(4) On the basis of information collected in Brazil during a mission carried out by the said FVO in July 2000, and supplied by the Secretaria de Defensa Agropecuária of the Ministério da Agricultura e do Abastecimento of Brazil it appears that Xanthomonas campestris, strains pathogenic to Citrus have only been detected in the States of Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paraná, São Paulo, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso do Sul. The list of areas recognised as being free of Xanthomonas campestris (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this.
(5) On the basis of information supplied during the above mission, it appears that Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) is present only in the States of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul. Therefore, other Brazilian states should be restored to the list of areas recognised as being free of Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus).
(6) In 2000, interceptions of fruits of Citrus sinensis originating in Swaziland, found infected by Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus), have been notified to the Commission. The list of countries recognised as being free from Guignardia citricarpa Kiely (all strains pathogenic to Citrus) should be amended to reflect this.
(7) Specific arrangement should be made for goods in transit for which the official statement foreseen by Annex IV, part A, section I, points 16.2 and 16.4 of Directive 2000/29/EC was issued in accordance with Decision 98/83/EC.

Whereas a list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of farmed game meat has been drawn up pursuant to Council Directive 92/118/EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 96/90/EC (6);
Whereas, for many of the countries on that list the animal health and veterinary certification requirements for importation of rabbit meat and farmed game meat products have been laid down in Commission Decision 97/219/EC (7);
Whereas the Commission has received from certain third countries lists of establishments, with guarantees that they fully meet the appropriate Community health requirements and that should an establishment fail to do so its export activities to the European Community will be suspended;
Whereas the Commission has been unable to ascertain in all the third countries concerned the compliance of their establishments with the Community requirements and the validity of the guarantees provided by the competent authorities;
Whereas, to prevent the interruption of trade in rabbit meat and farmed game meat from those countries, it is necessary to grant them a further period during which Member States will be able to continue to import rabbit meat and farmed game meat from the establishments they have recognized under the reservation that the trade in these meats will be limited to the national market; whereas during that further period the Commission will collect from those countries the guarantees needed in order to be able to add them to the list in accordance with the procedure laid down in Decision 95/408/EC;

Having regard to Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 July 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease (1), and in particular Article 9(2)(f)(ii) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/66/EEC defines the Union control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in poultry or in racing pigeons and other birds kept in captivity. Pursuant to that Directive, once the diagnosis of Newcastle disease has been officially confirmed in poultry, the Member State concerned is to ensure that the competent authority establishes around the infected holding a protection zone based on a minimum radius of 3 kilometres, itself contained in a surveillance zone based on a minimum radius of 10 kilometres.
(2) The measures applied in the protection zone are to include a prohibition on removing poultry and hatching eggs from the holding on which they are kept, unless the competent authority has authorised the transport under certain conditions.
(3) In particular, the competent authority may authorise the transport of day-old chicks or ready-to-lay pullets only to a holding within the surveillance zone at which there are no other poultry. However, Member States in which the transport of such chicks and pullets to a holding situated within the surveillance zone is not possible are to be authorised, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Directive 92/66/EEC, to have the chicks and pullets transported to a holding outside the surveillance zone.
(4) On 3 January 2011 France confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease in a holding of meat pigeons in the municipality of Langoat, in the department Côtes d’Armor. A protection and a surveillance zone had already been established around that holding on 30 December 2010.
(5) On 4 January 2011 France informed the Commission about the confirmation of the outbreak and the control measures adopted, including the prohibition of the movement and transport of poultry outside the established protection and surveillance zones, as provided for in Directive 92/66/EEC.
(6) The protection zone established by France comprises holdings with a considerable output of day-old chicks and ready-to-lay pullets and the holdings situated in the surveillance zone do not have sufficient capacity to receive that output. France has therefore informed the Commission that the transport of day-old chicks or ready-to-lay pullets to a holding situated within the surveillance zone is not possible.
(7) As a consequence, France has requested an authorisation to transport such chicks and pullets to holdings located outside the surveillance zone. Day-old chicks and ready-to-lay pullets originating from the holdings situated in the protection zone would remain in France.
(8) It is appropriate to provide for the requested authorisation subject to the condition that France takes strict control and precaution measures in accordance with Directive 92/66/EEC, that guarantee that there is no risk of spread of Newcastle disease.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '19.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 46/44', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 18 February 2011\nauthorising France, pursuant to Council Directive 92/66/EEC, to transport day-old chicks and ready-to-lay pullets outside the protection zone established due to an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the department of Côtes d’Armor\n(notified under document C(2011) 869)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(2011/111/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 92/66/EEC defines the Union control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in poultry or in racing pigeons and other birds kept in captivity.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 27(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 is to be granted under certain conditions to Community tuna producer organisations for quantities of tuna delivered to the processing industry during the calendar quarter for which prices had been recorded, where both the average quarterly selling price recorded on the Community market and the import price plus any applicable countervailing charge were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price for the product concerned.
(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market has shown that between 1 January and 31 March 2001 both the average quarterly selling price and the import price as referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price in force, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2764/2000(2).
(3) Entitlement to the compensatory allowance should be determined on the basis of sales covered by invoices bearing a date falling within the quarter concerned and which have been used to calculate the average monthly selling price referred to in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 142/98(3).
(4) The level of the compensation provided for in Article 27(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 may not in any case exceed either the difference between the triggering threshold and the average selling price of the product in question on the Community market or a flat-rate amount equivalent to 12 % of that threshold.
(5) The quantities on which compensation as provided for in Article 27(1) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 is payable may under no circumstances exceed the limits laid down in paragraph 3 of that Article for the quarter concerned.
(6) The quantities of skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) sold and delivered to the processing industry established in the customs territory of the Community were higher during the quarter concerned than the quantities sold and delivered during the same quarter of the three previous fishing years. Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should therefore be limited.
(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 1998, 1999 and 2000 fishing years.

Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) sets out, in Annex II, an exhaustive list of existing active substances to be evaluated under the work programme for the systematic examination of active substances already on the market, hereinafter referred to as the ‘review programme’, and prohibits the placing on the market of biocidal products containing active substances not listed in that Annex or in Annex I or IA to Directive 98/8/EC.
(2) However, Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 enables the Commission to grant derogation from that prohibition in cases where a Member State considers that an active substance is essential for reasons of health, safety or protection of cultural heritage or is critical for the functioning of society, and where there are no available technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health and provides that Member States may allow the placing on the market of active substances consisting solely of food or feed that are intended for use as repellents or attractants of product type 19.
(3) Those derogations may currently be used until 14 May 2010, since the review programme was initially foreseen to run only until that date.
(4) Directive 98/8/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/107/EC (3) extended the review programme until 14 May 2014.

of 26 November 2004
fixing certain indicative quantities and individual ceilings for the issue of licences for the import of bananas into the Community in the first quarter of 2005 under tariff quotas A/B and C
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 14(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 of 7 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community (2) provides that an indicative quantity expressed as the same percentage of available quantities from each of the tariff quotas A, B and C provided for in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 may be fixed for the purposes of issuing import licences for each of the first three quarters of the year.
(2) The data concerning, firstly, the quantities of bananas marketed in the Community in 2004, and in particular the actual imports, especially during the first quarter, and secondly, the supply and consumption prospects on the Community market during the same first quarter for 2005, result in indicative quantities being fixed for tariff quotas A and B and C so as to ensure adequate supplies for the whole of the Community, and the continuation of trade flows between the production and marketing sectors.

Whereas fluctuations in world market prices for cereals have become more marked in the past few years ; whereas it appears that the use of the world market prices for cereals applicable during the six months preceding the quarter during which the levy and the sluice-gate price are to be calculated can produce figures that no longer reflect price trends in non-member countries ; whereas it is therefore appropriate to up-date the basis of calculation by adopting a reference period of five months preceding the month in which the levy and the sluice-gate price are fixed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 368/76 of 16 February 1976 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 in respect of the reference period for calculating the levy and the sluice-gate price for eggs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe third subparagraph of Article 4 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n""The prices for feed grain on the world market shall be determined quarterly on the basis of the prices for such grain recorded for the five months ending one month before the quarter in respect of which the said component is calculated.""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe second subparagraph of Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n""The price for the quantity of feed grain shall be determined quarterly on the basis of the world market prices for such grain recorded for the five months ending one month before the quarter in respect of which the sluice-gate price is fixed.""'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 May 1976.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 February 1976.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001(2), and in particular Article 15 and Article 16(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Uruguay are laid down by Commission Decision 93/402/EEC of 10 June 1993 concerning animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from South American countries(3), as last amended by Decision 2001/842/EC(4).
(2) Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease were confirmed in Argentina starting on 13 March 2001 and a program of vaccination of bovines against foot and mouth disease was introduced.
(3) The Commission suspended the importation from Argentina into the Community of all categories of fresh meat from those species susceptible to foot and mouth disease by Commission Decision 2001/276/EC(5).
(4) A Commission mission took place, between 19 and 30 November 2001, in order to examine the epidemiological situation regarding foot and mouth disease and the control measures in place.
(5) This examination showed that the competent veterinary authorities of Argentina have addressed most of the concerns including those identified during previous missions, and that the disease situation has now stabilised in a number of provinces. However, additional guarentees were requested.
(6) The competent veterinary authorities of Argentina have sent the necessary additional information and guarantees requested and it is therefore appropriate to allow importations from certain provinces of deboned bovine fresh meat for human consumption, and of certain meat and offal derived from bovine species for direct treatment for pet food.
(7) Decision 93/402/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2007/669/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Estonia received on 2 January 2007 an application from Andermatt Biocontrol GmbH for the inclusion of the active substance Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2007/669/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 26 March 2009.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus
 (4) on 10 August 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft assessment report was finalised on 15 March 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(8) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Decision 2007/444/EC of 22 February 2007 on the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on the conclusion of GATT Article XXIV:6 Negotiations (3), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2375/2002 of 27 December 2002 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for common wheat of a quality other than high quality from third countries and derogating from Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 (4) has been substantially amended several times (5). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Following trade negotiations, the Community has changed the conditions for the import of common wheat of low and medium quality, that is common wheat of a quality other than high quality, as defined in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 on rules of application (cereal sector import duties) for Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 (6), by creating an import quota.
(3) This import quota relates to a maximum annual quantity of 2 989 240 tonnes, including 572 000 tonnes for imports originating in the United States and 38 853 tonnes for imports originating in Canada.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (7) applies to import licences for tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by this Regulation.
(6) To ensure that imports of the common wheat covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences.

authorising Romania to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 13 March 2013, Romania requested authorisation for the extension of a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC in relation to supplies of wood products.
(2) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 17 June 2013 of the request made by Romania. By letter dated 18 June 2013, the Commission notified Romania that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.
(3) Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC provides that the taxable person supplying the goods or services is, as a general rule, liable for the payment of value added tax (VAT) to the tax authorities.
(4) Council Implementing Decision 2010/583/EU (2) authorised Romania to apply a derogating measure pursuant to Article 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to designate the recipient as the person liable for the payment of VAT in the case of supplies of wood products by taxable persons.
(5) Prior to the former authorisation to apply reverse charge to the supplies of wood, Romania had encountered problems in the timber market because of the nature of the market and the businesses involved. There is a large number of small enterprises in this sector which the Romanian authorities have found difficult to control. Designating the recipient as the person liable for the payment of VAT has, according to the Romanian authorities, had the effect of preventing tax evasion and avoidance in this sector and therefore remains justified.
(6) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued since it is not intended to apply generally, but only to very specific operations in a sector which poses considerable problems of tax evasion or avoidance.
(7) The measure should not, in the Commission’s view, have any adverse impact on the prevention of fraud at the retail level or in other sectors or in other Member States.
(8) The authorisation should be limited in time until 31 December 2016.
(9) In the event that Romania requires a further extension beyond 2016, a report together with the extension request should be submitted to the Commission no later than 1 April 2016. In light of the experience gained up to that date, an assessment should be made on whether or not the derogation remains justified.
(10) The derogation has no adverse impact on the Union's own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '27.11.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 316/31', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 15 November 2013\nauthorising Romania to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2013/676/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 13 March 2013, Romania requested authorisation for the extension of a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC in relation to supplies of wood products.\n\n((2)) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 17 June 2013 of the request made by Romania.

amending Decision 2000/24/EC so as to extend the Community guarantee granted to the European Investment Bank to cover loans for projects in Croatia
(2000/688/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) On 6 March 1995, the General Affairs Council adopted negotiation directives for the conclusion of an economic and trade agreement including a financial protocol with Croatia. The financial protocol consisted of a special EUR 230 million European Investment Bank (EIB) loan facility for Croatia covering a five-year period. On 4 August 1995, the presidency of the Council announced the suspension of the negotiations with Croatia on the economic and trade agreement due to the start of military operations in Krajina.
(2) Recent developments, following the results of the parliamentary and the presidential elections in early 2000, have fundamentally changed the political scenario in Croatia. The new Croatian government is fully committed to implementing a political and economic reform programme in line with the conditions of the European Union Stabilisation and Association Process for the countries of South-Eastern Europe.
(3) The General Affairs Council of 24 January 2000 adopted a specific statement on Croatia and re-iterated its readiness to help Croatia meeting the challenges it faces in developing a closer relationship with the European Union.
(4) At the invitation of the General Affairs Council of 14 February 2000, the Commission on 24 May 2000 adopted a report on the feasibility of opening negotiations for a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Croatia. This report was endorsed by the General Affairs Council of 14 June 2000 and followed by adoption by the Commission on 19 July 2000 of a recommendation to the Council on the opening of negotiations.
(5) It is crucial to demonstrate the European Union's support to Croatia at this moment in implementing a political and economic reform programme elaborated after the elections of early 2000 in line with the European Union Stabilisation and Association Process, by supporting Croatia's investment activities in infrastructure and private sector development.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to provide a guarantee mandate to the EIB to allow it to sign loan operations in Croatia. The EIB has indicated its ability and willingness to extend loans from its own resources in Croatia, in accordance with its Statute.
(7) On 31 October 1994 the Council adopted Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 establishing a Guarantee Fund for external actions(3).
(8) Council Decision 2000/24/EC(4) grants the EIB a Community guarantee against losses under loans for projects outside the Community (Central and Eastern Europe, Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia and the Republic of South Africa).
(9) That global guarantee covering the general EIB external lending mandate laid down in Decision 2000/24/EC should be extended to Croatia. The loan ceilings should be increased in order to allow for the extension of corresponding loan facilities to Croatia. Decision 2000/24/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1) and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first paragraph of point 1 of Article 8 and point 4 of Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (2), and in particular Article 24(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down the general animal health rules governing all stages of the production, processing and distribution within the Union and the introduction from third countries of products of animal origin and products obtained therefrom intended for human consumption. That Directive provides that special import conditions are to be established for each third country or group of third countries, having regard to their animal health situation.
(2) Directive 2009/158/EC lays down the animal health conditions governing trade within the Union and imports from third countries of poultry and hatching eggs. That Directive provides that poultry is to come from third countries free of avian influenza or which, although they are not free from that disease, apply measures to control it which are at least equivalent to those laid down by the relevant Union legislation.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (3) provides that the commodities covered by it are only to be imported into and transited through the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto.
(4) Pursuant to that Regulation, where an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurs in a third country, territory, zone or compartment previously free of that disease, that third country, territory, zone or compartment is to again be considered as free of HPAI, provided that certain conditions are met; said conditions concern the implementation of a stamping out policy to control the disease, including adequate cleansing and disinfection carried out on all previously infected establishments. In addition, avian influenza surveillance must have been carried out in accordance with Part II of Annex IV to that Regulation during a three-month period following completion of the stamping out policy and cleansing and disinfection.
(5) Israel is currently listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as a third country free from highly pathogenic avian influenza. Imports of poultry commodities to which that Regulation applies are therefore authorised from the whole territory of that third country.
(6) Israel has notified to the Commission an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5N1 subtype on its territory.
(7) Due to the confirmed outbreak of HPAI, the territory of Israel may no longer be considered as free from that disease and the veterinary authorities of Israel have suspended issuing veterinary certificates for consignments of certain poultry commodities accordingly. Israel has also implemented a stamping out policy in order to control the disease and limit its spread.
(8) The information on the control measures taken has been submitted to the Commission. That information and the epidemiological situation in Israel have been evaluated by the Commission.
(9) The prompt and decisive action taken by Israel to confine the disease and the positive outcome of the evaluation of the epidemiological situation allows limiting the restrictions on imports into the Union for certain poultry commodities to the zones affected by the disease, which the veterinary authorities of Israel have placed under restrictions due to the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(10) In addition, Israel is carrying out surveillance activities for avian influenza which appear to meet the requirements laid down in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.
(11) Taking into account the favourable development of the epidemiological situation and related surveillance activities for avian influenza in resolving the outbreak, it is appropriate to limit the time period during which the authorisation for imports into the Union is suspended until 1 May 2010.
(12) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (3), and in particular Article 66(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread to other holdings, to wild birds and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the trade in live birds or their products.
(2) Directive 2005/94/EC lays down Community measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry and other captive birds and in order to avoid the spread of that disease. Those measures include the establishment of protection zones and a prohibition on the transport of poultry meat in such zones.
(3) Directive 2005/94/EC also provides for certain derogations from that prohibition, subject to certain conditions. Those conditions include inter alia that such meat must not enter into intra-Community or international trade and must bear the mark provided for in Annex II to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (4), unless otherwise decided as provided for in that Directive.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (5), provides for an identification mark to be applied to certain meat of animal origin.
(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (6), provides for the temporarily use of national marks for food of animal origin which may only be marketed in the territory of the Member State where they are produced.
(6) In addition, Commission Decision 2006/415/EC (7) provides for certain restrictions to be applied in areas A and B, including a prohibition on the dispatch from those areas of products intended for human consumption derived from wild feathered game. However, that Decision provides for derogations from that restriction for the dispatch onto the national market of certain meat and meat products and preparations, subject to certain conditions which include the marking of such meat as provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC.
(7) Commission Decision 2006/416/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain transitional measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry or other captive birds in the Community (8) lays down certain transitional measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease. Those measures include the establishment of protection zones in the case of an outbreak of the disease and the application of certain restrictions in such zones, including a prohibition on the movement of poultry meat. However, that Decision also provides for derogations from that prohibition subject to certain conditions, including the marking of such meat as provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC.
(8) Commission Decision 2006/563/EC of 11 August 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/115/EC (9) lays down certain measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in wild birds. Those measures include the establishment of control areas and the prohibition of the dispatch of meat and meat products and preparations from poultry and wild feathered game in such areas. However, that Decision also provides for derogations from that prohibition subject to certain conditions, including the marking of such meat with a mark in accordance with Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC or a national mark established in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005.
(9) Commission Decision 2007/118/EC of 16 February 2007 laying down detailed rules in relation to an alternative identification mark pursuant to Council Directive 2002/99/EC (10) provides for an alternative identification mark which may be used instead of the mark provided for in Annex II to Directive 2002/99/EC.
(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decisions 2006/415/EC, 2006/416/EC and 2006/563/EC in order to permit the use of that alternative identification mark.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '20.2.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 51/22', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 16 February 2007\namending Decisions 2006/415/EC, 2006/416/EC and 2006/563/EC as regards the identification mark to be applied to fresh poultrymeat\n(notified under document number C(2007) 431)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/119/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming.

determining the percentage of quantities covered by applications for export licences for poultrymeat which may be accepted
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 of 16 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1383/2001(2), and in particular Article 3(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1372/95 provides for specific measures where applications for export licences concern quantities and/or expenditure which exceed the normal trade patterns or where there is a risk that they will be exceeded, taking account of the limit referred to in Article 8(11) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2916/95(4), and/or the corresponding expenditure during the period in question.
(2) Uncertainty is a feature of the market in certain poultrymeat products.

(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy (1) requires that measures governing access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities be established taking into account available scientific advice and, in particular, the report drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).
(3) It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides for a complete revision of Community rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption, including the introduction of a number of strict requirements. In addition, it provides that appropriate transitional measures may be adopted.
(2) In view of the strict nature of those requirements, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for Finland and the United Kingdom in order to allow industry sufficient time to adjust. In addition, alternative collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and uses for animal by-products need to be further developed as well as disposal methods for those by-products.
(3) Accordingly, as a temporary measure a derogation should be granted to Finland and the United Kingdom to enable them to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules for the low capacity incineration or co-incineration plants which do not incinerate or co-incinerate specified risk material or carcases containing them.
(4) In order to prevent a risk to animal and public health, appropriate control systems should be maintained in Finland and the United Kingdom for the period of the transitional measures.

authorising the Italian Republic to apply a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Italian Republic did not make use of the provisions of Article 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC of 11 April 1967 on the harmonisation of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes — Structure and procedures for application of the common system of value added tax (2) which means that a scheme to exempt taxable persons could only be introduced in respect of taxable persons whose annual turnover was no higher than EUR 5 000.
(2) In a letter registered by the Commission's Secretariat-General on 15 November 2007 Italy requested authorisation from 1 January 2008 for a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to exempt taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 30 000. This measure will release those taxable persons from certain or all of the value added tax (VAT) obligations referred to in Chapters 2 to 6 of Title XI of Directive 2006/112/EC, whilst the optional character of the measure will allow businesses to opt for the normal VAT arrangements.
(3) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 6 May 2008 of the request made by Italy. By letter dated 8 May 2008, the Commission notified Italy that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.
(4) A special scheme for small enterprises is already available to Member States under Title XII of Directive 2006/112/EC. This measure derogates from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC only in so far as the annual turnover threshold for the scheme is higher than that currently allowed for Italy.
(5) The threshold requested by Italy may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of the smallest businesses. It is in line with the thresholds that apply with respect to certain other Member States.
(6) The Commission is committed to establishing a common annual turnover threshold below which taxable persons may be exempt from VAT as a measure to help reduce the burdens on small businesses. In 2004 the Commission proposed to allow Member States the option of increasing the annual turnover threshold for small businesses to be exempt from VAT. The Italian request is in line with the Commission proposal.
(7) Italy would also like the possibility to increase the ceiling to maintain its value in real terms, and so be able to apply a provision akin to that in Article 286 of Directive 2006/112/EC to this measure.
(8) Considering that the tax period is annual and in order to allow taxable persons to benefit from the simplification measure as soon as possible, Italy should be allowed to make the optional scheme available as from 1 January 2008.
(9) The derogation will have no impact on the European Communities' own resources accruing from value added tax.
(10) From information provided by the Italian Republic, the measure will lead to a reduction of the overall amount of tax revenue collected at the final stage of consumption of some 0,15 % in the first year of implementation, rising to around 0,25 % in the following two years,","{'header': '18.9.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 249/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 15 September 2008\nauthorising the Italian Republic to apply a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2008/737/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Italian Republic did not make use of the provisions of Article 14 of Second Council Directive 67/228/EEC of 11 April 1967 on the harmonisation of legislation of Member States concerning turnover taxes — Structure and procedures for application of the common system of value added tax(2)which means that a scheme to exempt taxable persons could only be introduced in respect of taxable persons whose annual turnover was no higher than EUR 5\xa0000.\n\n((2)) In a letter registered by the Commission's Secretariat-General on 15 November 2007 Italy requested authorisation from 1 January 2008 for a measure derogating from Article 285 of Directive 2006/112/EC in order to exempt taxable persons whose annual turnover is no higher than EUR 30\xa0000.

Whereas, by letter dated 19 May 1982, the Federal Republic of Germany has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as ""Dionex - Ion Chromatograph, model 14"", ordered on 30 January 1981 and to be used for the determination of the main components in leakage water samples, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

The 'Youth for Europe' programme is designed as a range of incentive measures to promote the development of youth exchanges in the European Community. The measures are directed at young people from 15 to 25 years of age, as well as youth organizations, youth workers, non-governmental organizations, public authorities and all other bodies able to play a role in promoting or organizing youth exchanges.\n\n2. The following may be implemented in order to improve direct and indirect support for youth exchanges.\n\nA. Measures providing financial aid for youth exchanges with an explicitly educational purpose, expressed in the form of a coherent project. Such a project would be so devised that the impact or repercussions of the exchange, in terms of cooperation or individual or group training, may be assessed. Exchanges organized as part of an educational or vocational training programme shall be excluded. Aid for exchanges shall not normally exceed 50 % of the total expenses incurred (journey and programme), but in certain justified cases the aid may cover up to a maximum of 75 %; the Commission shall, after consulting the Committee mentioned in Article 4 of the Decision, establish the criteria for granting this higher rate of aid. In calculating the aid to each Member State, quantitative objectives will be assigned in relation to the number of young people from 15 to 25 years of age in its population. The calculation will also take account of:\n\n- the average cost of living in each Member State in relation to the Community average,\n\n- the geographical distance between the Member States,\n\n- the restoration of the balance of the flow of exchanges within the Community.\n\nIn the allocation of grants, priority will be given to exchanges which:\n\n- bring together young people with different social, economic and cultural backgrounds,\n\n- make young people aware of the European dimension, for example through their multilateral nature,\n\n- are designed also for young people with disadvantaged backgrounds,\n\n- have been initiated and planned by groups of young people themselves,\n\n- concern regions of the Community where few opportunities for exchanges are available.\n\nB. Aid for short study visits by groups of youth workers to acquaint themselves with the situation of young people in other Member States and make appropriate contacts for the organization of youth exchanges under the programme.\n\nC. Aid for the setting-up and, exceptionally, for the development, of a youth exchange infrastructure by European non-governmental organizations.\n\nD. Assistance for the setting-up and development of specific activities organized or sponsored by the bodies referred to in Article 7 (2) of the Decision. These activities shall be concerned, in particular, with the development of:\n\n(a) internal information policy, including provision for an up-to-date central data service on all youth exchange opportunities and on sources of funding, advice and training for exchange organizers, as well as provisions for the dissemination of information to young people and exchange organizers at regional and local level;\n\n(b) external information policy, including liaison with coordination agencies in other Member States and provision of multilingual information and advice to young people coming from abroad and to organizers of incoming youth exchanges, with account being taken of Council of Europe activities in this connection;\n\n(c) consultation facilities, to give practical guidance on the preparation of youth exchanges and offer training courses, including language tuition, to exchange organizers. The said bodies shall submit each year to the Commission a draft plan for the implementation of the programme in their country, in conformity with the criteria laid down in paragraph 2 A of this Annex. They shall moreover have the task of administering at national level the financial aid measures established by the programme, in particular the direct aid for youth exchanges, including making decisions about the choice of beneficiaries and the amount to be allocated, within the limits laid down in the Decision and on the basis of the joint criteria referred to in paragraph 4 of this Annex. The Member State body concerned shall allocate financial aid both for its young people travelling abroad on exchange visits and for hosting visits from other Member States.\n\nIn the case of multilateral exchanges emanating from European or multilateral organizations, requests for aid may be addressed directly to the Commission, which shall deal with them in accordance with joint criteria and in cooperation with the national bodies concerned.\n\nE. Aid for training for youth workers from two or more Member States aimed at better organization and exploitation of youth exchanges, in particular exchanges which have specific themes and involve a number of nationalities. In this connection, account will be taken of the activites of the Council of Europe and other bodies working in the same area.\n\n3.

DECISION No 455/2009/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 6 May 2009
amending Council Directive 76/769/EEC as regards restrictions on the marketing and use of dichloromethane
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) The risks posed to human health by dichloromethane (DCM) in paint strippers have been assessed in several studies (3) which have concluded that risk reduction measures are required throughout the Community to reduce the risks posed to human health during the application of DCM at industrial, professional and consumer levels. The results of those studies have been evaluated by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE — later renamed the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER)) which has confirmed that exposure to DCM released from paint strippers is of concern for human health.
(2) In order to achieve a high level of health protection for all use categories (industrial, professional and general public), the marketing and use of paint strippers containing DCM should be restricted.
(3) Paint strippers containing DCM are used by members of the general public at home to remove paints, varnishes and lacquers both indoors and outdoors. The safe use of DCM by them cannot be ensured by training or monitoring. Therefore, the only measure effective in eliminating the risks arising for the general public from paint strippers containing DCM is a ban, with respect to the general public, on the marketing, supply and use of such paint strippers.
(4) In order to ensure a proportionate enforceability of the phase-out along the supply chain of paint strippers containing DCM, different dates to prohibit the first placing on the market and the final supply to the general public and professionals should be fixed.
(5) As the general public may have, despite the ban, access to paint strippers containing DCM through the distribution chain intended for industrial and professional users, a warning phrase should be included on the product.
(6) The fatalities registered in Europe for industrial and professional uses over the last 18 years are mainly attributed to inadequate ventilation, inappropriate personal protective equipment, the use of inadequate tanks and overexposure to DCM. Therefore restrictions should be imposed to control and reduce the risks involved in industrial and professional uses.
(7) Professionals are generally covered by worker protection legislation. However, many professional activities are often conducted on customers’ premises which often do not have all the appropriate measures to manage, control and reduce the risks to health. Moreover, self-employed workers are not covered by Community worker protection legislation and they would need adequate training before removing paint with paint strippers containing DCM.
(8) The placing on the market of paint strippers containing DCM and their use by professionals should therefore be banned in order to protect their health and to reduce the number of fatalities and non-fatal accidents. Nevertheless, where the replacement of DCM is deemed to be particularly difficult or inappropriate, Member States should be able to allow further use of DCM by approved professionals. Member States should be responsible for granting and monitoring such a derogation, which should be based on compulsory training with specific requirements. However, employers and self-employed workers should by preference avoid the use of DCM by replacing it with a chemical agent or process which, under its conditions of use, presents no risk, or a lower risk, to the health and safety of workers.
(9) The number of fatalities and non-fatal accidents registered during industrial activities is an indication of inadequate compliance with workplace legislation applicable to workers using DCM. Exposure to DCM remains high and further risk reduction measures should apply to workers in industrial installations. Preventive measures to minimise exposure and to ensure compliance, where technically possible, with relevant occupational exposure limits should be adopted, such as effective ventilation of the workplace, measures to minimise evaporation of DCM from strip tanks, measures for the safe handling of DCM in strip tanks, appropriate personal protective equipment and adequate information and training.
(10) Personal protective equipment should comply with Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (4).
(11) Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (5) should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) This Decision is without prejudice to the Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers, such as Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (6) and individual Directives based thereon, in particular Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC) (codified version) (7) and Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (fourteenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (8),","{'header': '3.6.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 137/3', 'title': 'DECISION No 455/2009/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 May 2009\namending Council Directive 76/769/EEC as regards restrictions on the marketing and use of dichloromethane\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The risks posed to human health by dichloromethane (DCM) in paint strippers have been assessed in several studies(3)which have concluded that risk reduction measures are required throughout the Community to reduce the risks posed to human health during the application of DCM at industrial, professional and consumer levels.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
(3) The application of the above criteria gives the world market price for unginned cotton determined hereinafter,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1477/2003 of 20 August 2003 determining the world market price for unginned cotton', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe world price for unginned cotton as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 is hereby determined as equalling EUR 26,018/100 kg.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 21 August 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 August 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1)b of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(p) and listed in Part XVI of Annex I to that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these goods are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) In accordance with the second paragraph, subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed.
(4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.
(7) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one-hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The refunds referred to above must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Application of these quotas results in fixing refunds for the products in question at the levels given in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The period of validity of export licences issued in July 2001 should be limited so that there is no difference in treatment between operators using the licences by 30 September 2001 and those using them after that date.

Whereas it is necessary to enable the United Kingdom to grant the premium when animals are first placed on the market with a view to their slaughter; whereas, in this case, measures should be taken to ensure that animals or the meat therefrom cannot qualify more than once for the premium;
Whereas Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 lays down that the amount of the premium is to be equal to the difference between the seasonalized guide level and the recorded market price in this region;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular point (f) in the second subparagraph of Article 33(1),
Whereas:
(1) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the possibility of a crisis distillation measure in the event of exceptional market disturbance due to major surpluses. Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production, and may apply to quality wines psr at the request of the Member State concerned.
(2) Portugual has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wine produced in its territory.
(3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the table wine market in Portugal, which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the 2005/06 marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend, and so remedy the difficult market situation, stocks of table wine should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements.
(4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied, a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 200 000 hectolitres of table wine.
(5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms (2) as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances.
(6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with by allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(2), first subparagraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASSF) has been notified on 23 April 2008 that sunflower oil originating from Ukraine was found contaminated with high levels of mineral oil. This contamination by mineral oil was later confirmed in several consignments of crude sunflower oil originating from Ukraine imported in recent months in the Community. Sunflower oil containing high levels of mineral oil is unfit for human consumption and therefore deemed to be unsafe. The source of contamination is not yet known.
(2) The European Commission has repeatedly urged the Ukrainian authorities to provide information on the origin of the contamination and on the measures taken to prevent it in future. Assurances were also sought from the Ukrainian authorities as to the establishment of effective measures aimed at guaranteeing the appropriate sampling and analysis on the presence of mineral oil in consignments of sunflower oil leaving Ukraine with destination the European Community.
(3) Investigations aimed at identifying the source of contamination are ongoing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities also committed to the establishment of an appropriate control system that will ensure that all consignments of sunflower oil to be exported to the European Union are certified as not containing levels of mineral oil making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. However, the details of this control system have still to be provided to the Commission. The Commission should assess the control and certification system in order to verify the accuracy and the reliability to guarantee that the sunflower oil exported to the Community does not contain levels of mineral oil, making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. It has to be ensured that no exports of sunflower oil to the Community will take place until such control and certification system is put in place and assessed and accepted by the Commission. The assessment of the control and certification system will be performed on the basis of detailed information provided by the Ukrainian authorities.
(4) Given the level of risk, Member States should control the consignments of sunflower oil for the presence of mineral oil at import in order to provide additional guarantees for the accuracy and reliability of the control and certification system put in place by the Ukrainian authorities.
(5) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(6) Pending the assessment and acceptance of the control and certification system to be put in place by the Ukrainian authorities, no imports of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine should take place due to the risk of contamination with mineral oil.
(7) Member States have been informed of the contamination incident and have taken the appropriate measures to withdraw the contaminated sunflower oil and food products containing contaminated sunflower already placed on the market, as recommended by the European Commission via the RASFF.
(8) Given the urgency, pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and after having informed the authorities of Ukraine, it is appropriate to adopt these interim protection measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(2), first subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.

Whereas, pursuant to Articles 1 and 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 3832/90 suspension of customs duties in the context of preferential tariff ceilings is granted from 1 January to 30 June 1994 within the limits of the individual ceilings set out in column 7  of Annex I to that Regulation in respect of each of the categories of product under consideration; whereas as provided for in the third paragraph of Article 12 of the said Regulation, the Commission may, after 30 June 1994, take measures to stop  quantities being charged against any particular preferential tariff limit if these limits were exceeded particularly as a result of regularizations of imports actually made during the preferential tariff period;
Whereas, in respect of the products of order Nos, categories and origins indicated in the table below, the relevant ceilings were fixed at the levels indicated in that table:

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1277/95 of 29 May 1995 on certain procedures for applying the Agreement on free trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and the European Coal and Steel Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Lithuania, of the other part (10), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas experience gained and forecasts for 1996 show that, in the absence of Community measures, massive imports into the Community of live bovine animals of up to 300 kg are likely to occur, due, in particular, to the economically favourable stock farming conditions existing in certain third countries; whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed the traditional annual level of imports and the absorption capacity of the Community market; whereas, therefore, the beef and veal market would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering, in particular, market prices and producers' incomes;
Whereas, however, it is necessary to take into account the application of the Agreement concluded during the WTO multilateral trade negotiations; whereas the management measures provided for should therefore be restricted to products from the third countries to which the Community grants preferential treatment and which have accepted that the Community take measures to manage the importation of the animals in question;
Whereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1996 is estimated at 425 000 head other than pure bred breeding animals; whereas, in view of imports planned under certain preferential arrangements for 1996, i.e. 300 500 head under the quota established in the context of the Uruguay Round concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for fattening and under the Europe Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria and the agreements on free trade and trade-related measures with the Baltic Republics, 124 500 head should be admitted for import in 1996 at the full or reduced rate of import duty, as the case may be.
Whereas, in respect of the first half of 1996, Commission Regulation (EC) No 3018/95 (11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 425/96 (12), and (EC) No 403/96 (13) have already provided for imports of 89 000 head; whereas management measures should be taken for imports of the remaining 35 500 head in the second half of 1996 with, as countries of origin, the aforementioned countries;
Whereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria;
Whereas, in order to take account to the greatest extent of the traditional structure of the Community veal market, imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less;
Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional importers of live bovine animals; whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a significant number of animals; whereas in consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, a minimum of 100 animals should be required to have been exported or imported during 1995 by the operators concerned; whereas a batch of 100 animals in principle constitutes a normal load and whereas experience has shown that the sale or purchase of a single batch is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State;
Whereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers, therefore, imports carried out between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1995 from countries considered third countries depending on the year of importation should be taken into account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities reserved for traditional importers;
Whereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1996;
Whereas the quota in question should be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be set on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, by way of derogation, if necessary, from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (15), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (16), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2856/95 (17); whereas it should moreover be stipulated that licences are to be issued following a reflection period and where necessary with a flat-rate percentage reduction applied;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1110/96 of 20 June 1996 introducing management measures for imports of certain bovine animals for the second half of 1996', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nImports into the Community during the second half of 1996 at the full duty rate provided for in the Common Customs Tariff of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 21, 0102 90 29, 0102 90 41 and 0102 90 49, as referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (18), originating in the third countries listed in Annex I, shall be subject to the management measures laid down in this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(5), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(6), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(7), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(8), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(9) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(10) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(11), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 42 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Deadlines for payments of aid to beneficiaries laid down in Community agricultural legislation must be respected by the Member States. Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 provides that any overrun of those payment deadlines by the paying agencies shall make the payments ineligible for Community financing, except in cases, conditions and limits determined, according to the principle of proportionality.
(2) Pursuant to Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 (2) where the expenditure effected after the deadlines is equal to 4 % or less of the expenditure effected before the deadlines, no reduction should be made.
(3) The Commission presented a declaration at the meeting of the Special Committee on Agriculture on 6 October 2008 (3) on the increase from 4 % to 5 % of the threshold provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006. It is therefore appropriate to increase the threshold for eligible late payments. The new threshold should apply where the payment deadline expires after 15 October 2009.
(4) Article 8(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (4) provides that the total net amount of direct payments granted in a Member State in respect of a calendar year, after application of modulation and voluntary modulation and without prejudice to financial discipline with the exception of direct payment granted under Council Regulations (EC) No 247/2006 (5) and (EC) No 1405/2006 (6), shall not be higher than the ceilings set out in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. In order to ensure financial discipline, specific provisions should be laid down to avoid that non-compliance with payment deadlines would lead to total expenditure for direct payments exceeding those ceilings in the corresponding financial exercise.
(5) Furthermore, in line with current practice and in order to ensure transparency, certain provisions should be further clarified.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The amendments should apply from 16 October 2009 in the case of revenue received and expenditure effected by Member States in respect of 2010 and following financial years.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 97/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 May 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information society services (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 97/23/EC provides that pressure equipment and assemblies may be placed on the market and put into service only if, when properly installed and maintained and used for their intended purpose, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property.
(2) Pressure equipment and assemblies are presumed to meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC if they conform to the national standards transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 97/23/EC Sweden lodged a formal objection in respect of standard EN 3-9:2006 adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 2 November 2006 the references of which have not yet been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(4) Sweden considers that sections 4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 6 and 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 do not satisfy the essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.
(5) With regard to section 4 (materials) of EN 3-9:2006, Sweden considers that only general information is given and that it is therefore not possible to provide for technical solutions with regard to the material requirements in point 4 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC. The precise choice of material is, in this context, an essential element in order to meet several of the essential safety requirements for pressure equipment in accordance with the relevant requirement of Mandate M/071 to CEN.
(6) Section 4 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not specify the types of materials to be used. The standard only precludes the use of non-metallic materials for bodies of operating devices and it requires that the materials of the components that may be in contact with the contents shall be compatible with both the contents and the material of other components. Therefore, in the absence of concrete technical specifications, section 4 of EN 3-9:2006 can not confer the presumption of conformity to the requirements of point 4 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.
(7) With regard to section 5 (design) of standard EN 3-9:2006, and in particular sections 5.1 and 5.2, Sweden is of the opinion that they do not contain technical requirements with regard to the design of CO2 containers for adequate strength as regards pressure containment. Sweden considers that these clauses do not comply with points 2.3 and 2.9 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.
(8) Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of standard EN 3-9:2006 do not contain any specific requirements on the design of the cylinder and of the operating device, neither any detailed technical solution to ensure safe filling and discharge. Therefore, they are not sufficient to confer the presumption of conformity to the requirements of safe handling and operation in point 2.3 and of safe filling and discharge in point 2.9 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.
(9) Sweden also considers that section 5.4 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not comply with point 2.11.2 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.
(10) Section 5.4 of standard EN 3-9:2006 states that the bursting disc safety device of the extinguisher must be activated when the pressure is between 10 % more than the maximum allowable pressure PS and the test pressure PT. The bursting disc is classified in the standard as a safety accessory. However, the bursting disc is not a typical pressure limiting device but rather a protection device, as it intends to limit damage in case of overfilling or overheating. Furthermore, point 2.11.2 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC on pressure limiting devices requires that these devices are so designed that the pressure will not permanently exceed the maximum allowable pressure PS and that only a short-duration surge may exceed PS and even then only 10 %. Therefore, this section can not confer the presumption of conformity to Directive 97/23/EC.
(11) In the view of Sweden, section 6 of standard EN 3-9:2006 (manufacturing of the assembled extinguisher) is intended, according to its Annex ZA, to ensure compliance with the requirements of point 2.8 (Assemblies) of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC. However, point 2.8 of Annex I to that Directive relates rather to the design and not to the manufacturing of the assembled extinguisher.
(12) Point 2.8 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC contains design requirements for the assemblies, in order to ensure the suitability of the different components, their proper integration and appropriate assembly to an integrated and functional whole. Point 3 of Annex I to that Directive contains detailed requirements relating to manufacturing.
(13) Section 6 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not contain specific requirements with regard to the design. It contains rather general information on both the design and manufacturing, without however being sufficient to confer the presumption of conformity to the requirements of point 2.8 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC. Furthermore, as the content of this section does not correspond to the relevant requirements of the Directive, it might create confusion.
(14) Finally, Sweden considers that section 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not comply with the requirements of point 3.3 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC, as two of the most important parameters, the maximum allowable pressure PS and the maximum allowable temperature (TSmax) are missing.
(15) Directive 97/23/EC contains in point 3.3 of Annex I detailed requirements on the marking and labelling of pressure equipment. This includes, for all pressure equipment, information on the essential maximum/minimum allowable limits.
(16) Section 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 contains marking requirements on the maximum allowable pressure PS, but not on the allowable minimum and maximum temperature (TSmin/TSmax). Therefore, it is not sufficient to confer the presumption of conformity to point 3.3 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.
(17) In addition, the overall assessment of the structure and the content of standard EN 3-9:2006 is unclear as to whether it addresses the design requirements for the assembly only (portable pressure extinguisher) or also covers the design of the components and the manufacturing phase of the assembly. It is liable to create confusion as to its scope and the relationship between its clauses and the essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.
(18) Therefore, on the basis of EN 3-9:2006, of the information received in the framework of the consultation of the national authorities, CEN and industry and following assessment of all aspects concerned, it results that harmonised standard EN 3-9:2006 fails to meet the corresponding essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.
(19) The references of standard EN 3-9:2006 should therefore not be published in the Official Journal of the European Union,","{'header': '19.2.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 48/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 10 February 2009\non the non-publication of the reference of standard EN 3-9:2006 ‘Portable fire extinguishers — Part\xa09: Additional requirements to EN 3-7 for pressure resistance of CO2extinguishers’, in accordance with Directive 97/23/EC concerning pressure equipment\n(notified under document number C(2009) 666)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/140/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 97/23/EC provides that pressure equipment and assemblies may be placed on the market and put into service only if, when properly installed and maintained and used for their intended purpose, they do not endanger the health and safety of persons and, where appropriate, domestic animals and property.\n\n((2)) Pressure equipment and assemblies are presumed to meet the essential requirements set out in Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC if they conform to the national standards transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n\n((3)) Pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 97/23/EC Sweden lodged a formal objection in respect of standard EN 3-9:2006 adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 2 November 2006 the references of which have not yet been published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n\n((4)) Sweden considers that sections 4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 6 and 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 do not satisfy the essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.\n\n((5)) With regard to section 4 (materials) of EN 3-9:2006, Sweden considers that only general information is given and that it is therefore not possible to provide for technical solutions with regard to the material requirements in point 4 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.

Therefore, this section can not confer the presumption of conformity to Directive 97/23/EC.\n\n((11)) In the view of Sweden, section 6 of standard EN 3-9:2006 (manufacturing of the assembled extinguisher) is intended, according to its Annex ZA, to ensure compliance with the requirements of point 2.8 (Assemblies) of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC. However, point 2.8 of Annex I to that Directive relates rather to the design and not to the manufacturing of the assembled extinguisher.\n\n((12)) Point 2.8 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC contains design requirements for the assemblies, in order to ensure the suitability of the different components, their proper integration and appropriate assembly to an integrated and functional whole. Point 3 of Annex I to that Directive contains detailed requirements relating to manufacturing.\n\n((13)) Section 6 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not contain specific requirements with regard to the design. It contains rather general information on both the design and manufacturing, without however being sufficient to confer the presumption of conformity to the requirements of point 2.8 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC. Furthermore, as the content of this section does not correspond to the relevant requirements of the Directive, it might create confusion.\n\n((14)) Finally, Sweden considers that section 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 does not comply with the requirements of point 3.3 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC, as two of the most important parameters, the maximum allowable pressure PS and the maximum allowable temperature (TSmax) are missing.\n\n((15)) Directive 97/23/EC contains in point 3.3 of Annex I detailed requirements on the marking and labelling of pressure equipment. This includes, for all pressure equipment, information on the essential maximum/minimum allowable limits.\n\n((16)) Section 8 of standard EN 3-9:2006 contains marking requirements on the maximum allowable pressure PS, but not on the allowable minimum and maximum temperature (TSmin/TSmax). Therefore, it is not sufficient to confer the presumption of conformity to point 3.3 of Annex I to Directive 97/23/EC.\n\n((17)) In addition, the overall assessment of the structure and the content of standard EN 3-9:2006 is unclear as to whether it addresses the design requirements for the assembly only (portable pressure extinguisher) or also covers the design of the components and the manufacturing phase of the assembly. It is liable to create confusion as to its scope and the relationship between its clauses and the essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.\n\n((18)) Therefore, on the basis of EN 3-9:2006, of the information received in the framework of the consultation of the national authorities, CEN and industry and following assessment of all aspects concerned, it results that harmonised standard EN 3-9:2006 fails to meet the corresponding essential requirements of Directive 97/23/EC.\n\n((19)) The references of standard EN 3-9:2006 should therefore not be published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe reference of standard EN 3-9:2006 ‘Portable fire extinguishers — Part 9: Additional requirements to EN 3-7 for pressure resistance of CO\n2\nextinguishers’ shall not be published in the list of standards published in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

Having regard to Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products and repealing Directives 85/358/EEC and 86/469/EEC and Decisions 89/187/EEC and 91/664/EEC (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 96/23/EC lays down measures to monitor the substances and groups of residues listed in Annex I thereto. Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and primary products of animal origin covered by that Directive, are subject to the submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in that Directive.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC (2) lists those third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.
(3) Brazil has submitted to the Commission a new residue monitoring plan concerning honey. The evaluation of that plan demonstrates that it provides sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring for honey in that third country. In addition, an inspection visit to Brazil has revealed that substantial progress has been made by the competent authority in implementing a comprehensive residues monitoring plan for honey and that that third country now complies with Community requirements for honey. Honey should therefore be included in the list for Brazil in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC.
(4) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '14.3.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 70/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 March 2008\namending Decision 2004/432/EC on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\n(notified under document number C(2008) 932)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/222/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 96/23/EC lays down measures to monitor the substances and groups of residues listed in Annex I thereto.

In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station on 26 April 1986, considerable quantities of radioactive elements were released into the atmosphere.
(3) Without prejudice to the possibility of resorting, where necessary, in the future to the provisions of Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and of feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency (3), the Community should ensure, with regard to the specific effects of the accident at Chernobyl, that agricultural products and processed agricultural products intended for human consumption and likely to be contaminated are introduced into the Community only according to common arrangements.
(4) Those common arrangements should safeguard the health of consumers, maintain, without having unduly adverse effects on trade between the Community and third countries, the unified nature of the market and prevent deflections of trade.
(5) Compliance with the maximum permitted levels should be the subject of appropriate checks, which may lead to prohibiting imports in cases of non-compliance.
(6) Radioactive contamination in many agricultural products has decreased and will continue to decrease to the levels existing before the Chernobyl accident. A procedure should therefore be established enabling such products to be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.

(1) Quotas in addition to those shown in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 may be opened when required under special circumstances. The Commission has received a request to open additional quotas in view of trade fairs to be held in 2003.
(2) Additional quotas have already been opened for trade fairs in previous years for certain third countries.
(3) Access to the additional quotas should be limited to products which have been exhibited by the exporting countries at the relevant fair and for the quantities agreed to by sales contracts, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State in which the fair is taking place.
(4) In order to avoid overutilisation of the additional quotas it is appropriate to request the Member State on the territory of which the fair is taking place, on the one hand, to ensure that the total amounts covered by certified contracts do not exceed the limits set for these additional quotas and, on the other hand, to inform the Commission after closure of the fair of the total quantities covered by such certified contracts.
(5) In respect of imports into the Community of products for which additional quotas are opened, it is appropriate to apply the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 governing imports of products subject to quantitative limits set out in Annex V to the said Regulation, with the exception of the provisions relating to flexibilities.
(6) Requests for import authorisations should moreover be accompanied by the contract signed at the relevant fair, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where it is held.
(7) In order to avoid circumvention, issue of import authorisations should cover only products shipped in the supplier country in which they originate no earlier than 1 January 2004.

(2) This Regulation authorises an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase as a feed additive for weaned piglets, chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying, turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding.
(3) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) performed the risk assessment in accordance with Article 8(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The application concerns the authorisation of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 114044) as a feed additive for weaned piglets, chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying, turkeys for fattening and turkeys reared for breeding, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(6) The Authority concluded in its opinions of 21 May 2008 (2) and 21 April 2009 (3) that the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 114044) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that the use of that preparation can have a significant benefit on body weight gain and feed conversion. The Authority did not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(7) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 41/2002 of 10 January 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 11 January 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 January 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 141, 24.6.1999, p. 12.\n\n(3) OJ L 145, 27.6.1968, p. 12.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 10 January 2002 fixing the representative prices and additional import duties to imports of molasses in the sugar sector\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

of 27 June 2002

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils(1), and in particular Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The United Kingdom has requested authorisation to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to biodiesel used as road fuel either as pure fuel or blended into diesel fuels up to 5 per cent volume in accordance with EN 590.
(2) The other Member States have been informed of the United Kingdom's request.
(3) The development of renewable energies and biofuels in particular has been encouraged in the Community since 1985. Most recently, on 7 November 2001, the Commission adopted an action plan and two proposals for directives on encouraging the use of substitute fuels in the transport sector, starting with regulatory and tax measures designed to promote biofuels.
(4) The derogation requested by the United Kingdom authorities is therefore in line with the Community's policy of developing the biofuel sector, in the interests of protecting the environment and ensuring security of energy supply.
(5) The rate for biodiesel would be set at 20 pence per litre below that for ultra-low sulphur diesel (ULSD). This equates to an excise duty of 25,82 pence (41,4 eurocents) per litre of biodiesel at current rates. Furthermore, the reduction in excise duty proposed by the United Kingdom is proportional to the percentage of biofuel contained in the final product.
(6) The effective rates of excise duty are higher than the applicable Community minimum rates, in accordance with Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils(2):
>TABLE>
(7) The requested reduction should concern biodiesel, a fuel made from biomass within the meaning of Article 2(b) of Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market(3), or made from used fried oils, to be used as a road fuel.
(8) The differentiated rate would apply to pure biodiesel at the point of production or import. The biodiesel can then be used either as pure fuel or be blended into diesel fuels. Duty on imported blends would be payable at the appropriate rates for the constituent parts in the relevant proportion.
(9) Production costs of biodiesel exceed those of conventional diesel, and its retail price would therefore be uncompetitive without the duty reduction. The duty reduction is intended to offset the additional production costs. It will enable biodiesel to be sold at a similar pump price to conventional diesel.
(10) The Government of the United Kingdom should annually review the production cost of biodiesel and thus monitor that no overcompensation takes place.
(11) The authorisation granted should apply for a period of five years.
(12) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or hinder the operation of the internal market and are not incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment, energy and transport,","{'title': '2002/550/EC: Council Decision of 27 June 2002 authorising the United Kingdom to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to fuels containing biodiesel in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 11 March 1987
concerning aid which the Belgian Government has granted to a ceramic sanitary ware manufacturer at La Louvière
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(87/423/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By Decisions 83/130/EEC (1) and 85/153/EEC (2) the Commission found that the Bfrs 475 million and Bfrs 83 million in aid granted without prior notification in 1981 and 1983 to a ceramics manufacturer at La Louvière in the form of subscriptions of new capital was incompatible with the common market and should therefore be withdrawn. These Decisions gave rise to Cases 52/84 and 40/85 before the Court of Justice.
Despite this repeated assistance, the firm in question, SA Boch, was again in financial difficulties in 1984. This induced the Belgian authorities, in this case the regional authorities, to decide to provide further assistance, this time in the form of a Bfrs 295,3 million capital injection. The Commission, which had initiated the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty on 23 August 1984, decided in Decision 86/366/EEC (3) that this third aid payment should not be made and that an advance of Bfrs 104 million, paid unlawfully in 1984 to enable the firm to continue trading until early 1985, should be recovered.
In January 1985, the Belgian regional authorities - which were virtually the only shareholder in SA Boch - decided to wind it up and create a new legal entity out of the sanitary ware division of the old company.
On 13 March 1985 a new company called Noviboch was set up and endowed by the Belgian Regional authorities with a fully paid-up share capital of Bfrs 400 million. On 1 June 1985 the new company resumed the business actvities of the sanitary ware division of its predecessor in liquidation. In August 1985 Noviboch acquired from the liquidators of Boch that company's buildings, the equipment and goodwill of its sanitary ware division and its stocks of sanitary ware estimated by the Commission to number some 100 000 items, but not its debts.
Noviboch started up on 1 September 1985.
II
On learning of its intention to set up and finance the new company, the Commission informed the Belgian Government by telex dated 23 January 1985 that any aid designed to permit the continued production of Boch ceramic sanitary ware should be notified to it in advance.
The Belgian Government replied by telex dated 1 February 1985, communicating its decision to wind up SA Boch and form as soon as possible a new legal entity to replace the old company; it did not accept, however, that its equity stake in the new company was aid. It announced that more detailed information would follow.
By letter dated 28 February 1985 the Commission reminded the Belgian Government of the series of unlawful aid awards the latter had made to Boch and sought an assurance from it that it would comply with its obligations under Article 93 of the EEC Treaty by notifying to the Commission any further aids at the proposal stage and by not implementing the planned measures before a final decision was taken under Article 93 (2) procedure. The Commission also wrote to Boch and Noviboch on 6 March 1985 drawing their attention to the uncertain status and unlawfulness of the aid in question and warning them that it might have to be repaid.
Having received no reply from the Belgian Government to its letter of 28 February 1985 and none of the detailed information promised, the Commission decided on 22 May 1985 to initiate the Article 93 (2) procedure in respect of the aid granted in the form of the subscription of Bfrs 400 million of share capital, any aid elements resulting from the resumption of the business activities of SA Boch in liquidation by Noviboch and the investment aids that were planned.
The Commission considered that the aid in question, which was caught by the prohibition provided for in Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty, did not prima facie satisfy the conditions for exemption under paragraphs 2 and 3 of that Article and, by letter dated 7 June 1985, gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments.
III
The Belgian Government answered the Commission's letter by telex dated 26 July 1985. It reiterated its view that the acquisition of a holding in the capital of Noviboch did not constitute State aid but could be likened to the decision of a private shareholder, there being a strong possibility that the new firm would show a profit, and argued that the setting-up of Noviboch would not threaten to distort competition as its production capacity was no larger than 5 000 to 6 000 tonnes. It denied that exports by the old enterprise Boch had increased considerably and reserved the right to provide further information on the subject in subsequent observations. It contended that, if the subscription of share capital was aid, it should benefit from the exemption provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) in favour of aid to promote the economic development of areas where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment.
As regards the take-over of the assets of SA Boch in liquidation, the Belgian Government challenged the view that the transfer, which was being effected under the sole responsibility of the liquidators of the old enterprise, involved any aid elements.
Lastly, it stated that it considered the procedure in question - and those preceding it - to be irregular as the Commission had not communicated to it the grounds on which it based its opposition to the capital subscription in question.
In response to a request from the Commission, the Belgian Government furnished additional information by letter dated 20 November 1986 on the production, sales and exports achieved by Noviboch since it started up and on the investments undertaken and planned. It added that no decision had been taken on whether to award investment aid under the Belgian economic expansion laws.
Within the framework of the consultation of other interested parties, the Governments of three other Member States, two industrial federations, SA Noviboch and two other enterprises in the same sector submitted observations.
IV
The provision of public funds to companies in the form of subscriptions of capital may involve elements of State aid. In the present case, the setting-up of Noviboch on behalf of the Belgian authorities cannot be viewed in isolation.
The effect of the winding-up of SA Boch and the concomitant setting-up of a new legal entity intended to continue some of the former's activities is altogether comparable to the consequences of a complete industrial and financial restructuring of SA Boch on behalf of the public authorities. The link between the two legal entities is highlighted by the fact that their address and telephone and telex numbers are identical and that the porcelain sanitary ware sold under the Noviboch name in 1985 was identical to that previously produced and sold by Boch. It is also evidenced by the fact that Noviboch is sharing the cost of redundancies connected with the transition from Boch to Noviboch.
Regard must also be had to the precarious financial position of Boch in January 1985 due to several years of heavy losses, the obsolescence of its facilities, the overcapacity in the ceramic sanitary ware sector, the obligation imposed on the Belgian Government to recover the aid granted illegally in 1981 and 1983 and the procedure initiated at that time in respect of the proposal to make a third aid payment, an advance on which had already been granted illegally in 1984.
In view of the above, the subscription of Bfrs 400 million of share capital to assist the continued production of ceramic sanitary ware at La Louvière via the setting-up of a new legal entity called Noviboch constitutes State aid. As to the aid elements, if any, stemming from the take-over by Noviboch of the movable and immovable assets of Boch, the Belgian Government observed that the transfer was effected under the sole responsibility of the liquidators of SA Boch, who performed their duties without any outside interference and assumed responsibility vis-à-vis third parties, and who had not failed to carry out all the necessary valuations. The other information gathered in the course of the procedure bears this out, so it must be concluded that the transfer in conjunction with the voluntary winding-up of Boch did not involve any aid elements.
The assistance under the Belgian economic expansion laws of 1959 and 1970 takes the form inter alia of interest subsidies on loans for carrying out investments, capital grants, State guarantees covering interest-subsidized loans contracted by enterprises with banks, and exemption from property tax for five years. Such measures constitute aid within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty because they enable the recipient enterprise to be relieved, by means of State resources, of part of the cost of the investment which it would normally have to bear itself.
Ceramic sanitary ware is traded between Member States and there is competition among producers. Noviboch exports some 60 % of its production of ceramic, or in this case porcelain, sanitary ware to the other Member States. Between June 1985 and September 1986 it sold 1 945 tonnes in Germany, 1 360 tonnes in the Netherlands, 380 tonnes in France, 136 tonnes in the United Kingdom, and 258 tonnes in various other countries, or 28,6 %, 20 %, 5,6 %, 2 % and 3,8 % of its total sales, respectively. Exports of sanitary ware (NIMEXE code 69.10-10) from the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union to other Member States amounted to 11 042 tonnes in 1982, 14 090 tonnes in 1983, 14 110 tonnes in 1984 and 11 072 tonnes in 1985, or 29,9 %, 34,8 %, 35,1 % and 29,6 %, respectively, of all intra-Community trade in sanitary ware (in terms of weight).
Consequently, the Belgian Government's aid affects trade between Member States and distorts competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) by favouring Noviboch and Belgian ceramic sanitary ware production.
Where financial assistance from the State strengthens the position of certain enterprises compared with that of others competing with them in the Community, it must be deemed to affect those other enterprises.
Article 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market. The exceptions provided for in Article 92 (2) are not applicable in this case because of the nature of the proposed assistance, which is not directed towards attainment of such objectives.
Article 92 (3) of the Treaty lists aid which may be compatible with the common market. Compatibility with the Treaty must be determined in the context of the Community as a whole and not in that of a single Member State. In order to ensure the proper functioning of the common market, and having regard to the principle embodied in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) must be construed narrowly when any aid scheme or any individual aid award is scrutinized.
In particular, they may be invoked only when the Commission is satisfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would be insufficient to guide the recipients towards patterns of behaviour that would serve one of the objectives of the said exceptions.
With regard to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) for aid that the development of certain areas, the La Louvière area, though eligible under the Belgian regional aids scheme owing to its unfavourable social and economic situation, is not one where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment within the meaning of those exceptions.
As regards the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), it is obvious that the aid measure is not intended to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy.
As to the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities or certain economic areas, Noviboch produces and markets quality ceramic sanitary ware on a fairly modest scale, with 269 employees. In volume terms, its output is currently 20 to 30 % lower than that of its predecessor Boch, which produced in quantity with over 400 employees in its sanitary ware division.
According to the information furnished by the Belgian Government in the course of the procedure, Noviboch's operations are profitable.
It should also be borne in mind that Noviboch did not take over Boch's crockery division, which likewise employed over 400.
The restructuring stemming from the winding-up of Boch has therefore contributed to the reorganization of a Community industry suffering from surplus production capacity, namely the ceramics industry.
The Commission has also taken note of the fact that La Louvière is situated in one of the least prosperous parts of Belgium.
In view of the above considerations, the aid in the form of a subscription of Bfrs 400 million of share capital granted in connection with the setting-up of Noviboch therefore qualifies for exemption under Article 92 (3) (c). In view of the excess production capacity in the ceramic sanitary ware sector, the authorization of this aid must nevertheless be made subject to specific conditions in order to prevent Noviboch from pursuing the same market-disturbing policy with the help of public funds as did its predecessor Boch.
To that end, it must be ensured that for a period of at least three years the authorities grant no operating aid or aid to finance projects capable of increasing the firm's output; a report should be sent each year during the period in question giving details of Noviboch's commercial activities so that the Commission may see to it that the common market functions properly.
So that the purposes of this Decision may be achieved, the Commission must also be informed of any aid proposals other than those referred to above which constitute individual awards under general or regional aid schemes already approved by the Commission,","{'title': '87/423/EEC: Commission Decision of 11 March 1987 concerning aid which the Belgian Government has granted to a ceramic sanitary ware manufacturer at La Louvière (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) provides that aid meeting the criteria laid down therein is in principle incompatible with the common market.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease of poultry and other captive birds with a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State, but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products.
(3) Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (2) sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus.
(4) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of that Decision, Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate avian influenza.
(5) Article 4(3), first and second indents of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union.
(6) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate avian influenza is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3).
(7) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in Germany in November 2010. Germany took measures in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC to combat those outbreaks.
(8) The German authorities were able to demonstrate through reports provided in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and continuous submission of information on the development of the disease situation that they have efficiently implemented the control measures provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC leading to the rapid containment of the disease.
(9) The German authorities have therefore fulfilled all their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 4(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.

(2) In its Resolutions of 5 February and 21 November 2002, the European Parliament endorsed the four-level approach advocated in the Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of European securities markets and called for certain aspects of that approach to be extended to the banking and insurance sectors subject to a clear Council commitment to reform to guarantee a proper institutional balance.
(3) On 3 December 2002, the Council invited the Commission to implement such arrangements in the fields of banking and insurance and occupational pensions and to establish as soon as possible new committees in an advisory capacity in relation to those fields.
(4) Council Directive 91/675/EEC of 19 December 1991 setting up an Insurance Committee(3) established a committee to advise the Commission in the development of legislation in the insurance field.
(5) The Commission has proposed a Directive modifying, inter alia, Directive 91/675/EEC, First Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance(4) as amended, Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 concerning life assurance(5), and Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate and amending Council Directives 73/239/EEC, 79/267/EEC, 92/49/EEC, 92/96/EEC, 93/6/EEC and 93/22/EEC, and Directives 98/78/EC and 2000/12/EC of the European Parliament and the Council(6), to delete the advisory functions of the Insurance Committee.
(6) Such an amendment requires the corresponding and simultaneous creation of a new advisory group to advise the Commission as regards the development of Community legislation in the insurance and occupational pensions fields, hereafter called the ""European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee"".
(7) To ensure this, this Decision should only come into being at the same time as any Directive repealing the purely advisory functions of the Insurance Committee.
(8) The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee should be competent to examine any question relating to the application of Community provisions concerning the fields of insurance and occupational pensions, and, in particular, should advise the Commission on new proposals for new legislation in those fields which the Commission intends to present to the European Parliament and the Council; however in the occupational pensions field, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee should not address labour and social law aspects such as the organisation of occupational regimes, in particular compulsory membership and the results of collective bargaining agreements,","{'title': '2004/9/EC: Commission Decision of 5 November 2003 establishing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn advisory group on insurance and occupational pensions in the Community, called the ""European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee"" (hereinafter ""the Committee"") is hereby established.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas this examination showed that the apparatus in question is a spectrometer; whereas its objective technical characteristics such as the great precision during the measurements and the use to which it is put make it specially suited to scientific research; whereas, moreover, apparatus of the same kind are principally used for scientific activities; whereas it must therefore be considered to be a scientific apparatus;

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1176/2002(4), lays down the detailed rules of application for export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant exports, the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds, within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports, it is appropriate to fix the A1 and B export refunds.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1861/2003 of 23 October 2003 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 24 October 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 October 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000, contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 ensures better comparability and transparency among the Member States in the recording of taxes and social contributions in ESA 95 for the Excessive Deficit Procedure. It provides that net lending/net borrowing of general government is not to include amounts of taxes and social contributions unlikely to be collected.
(3) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 Member States may ask the Commission for a transitional period in which to bring their accounting systems into line with that Regulation.
(4) By letter dated 21 June 2001, the Portuguese authorities have requested a transitional period to bring their accounting systems into line with Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000.
(5) Portugal has provided to the Commission evidence of the need to improve the knowledge of the parts of taxes and social contributions which are assessed and declared but unlikely to be collected. This improvement will benefit from the new Official Plan of Public Accounting which is being implemented and which is fully consistent with ESA 95 principles. However, the Commission considers that Portugal can be ready for a correct implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2516/2000 in mid 2002.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the enzyme 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 122001) as a feed additive for poultry for fattening and breeding other than turkeys for fattening, for poultry for laying and for pigs other than sows, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/42/EC(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Directive 2000/42/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 on the placing of plant protection products on the market(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/10/EC(5), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The new active substance, azoxystrobin, was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directive 98/47/EC(6) for use as fungicide only, without specifying particular conditions having an impact on crops which may be treated with plant protection products containing azoxystrobin.
(2) Maximum levels for azoxystrobin residues in and on all commodities covered by Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC were fixed by Commission Directive 1999/71/EC(7).
(3) In fixing the said maximum levels for azoxystrobin residues, it was recognised that these levels should be kept under review and should be changed to take account of new information and data. Directive 1999/71/EC acknowledged that national provisional maximum residue levels for other cereals and fruit and vegetables should be fixed by Member States as a part of their authorisation of plant protection products containing azoxystrobin and should be notified to the Commission under the requirements of Article 4(1)(f) to Directive 91/414/EEC. To facilitate this eventuality, some of the levels set in Directive 1999/71/EC were fixed on a provisional basis, enabling Member States to grant further authorisations for new uses and to notify the Commission under the procedure described by the said Article. This Article provides that where a provisional Community maximum residue level exists and where the new authorised use would lead to higher levels, the authorising Member State shall establish a national provisional maximum residue level in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before the authorisation may be granted.
(4) To ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it was considered prudent, in adopting Directive 1999/71/EC, to set provisional maximum residue levels at the lower level of analytical determination for such products. The setting at Community level of such provisional maximum residue levels is without prejudice to the granting of provisional authorisations by the Member States for the use of azoxystrobin on such products in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(5) In order to authorise a plant protection product, Member States must apply the uniform principles provided for in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC in evaluating, in particular, a dossier conforming to the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC, submitted by the applicant for authorisation. Annex III, Part A, Section 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC requires applicants to submit certain information including proposed maximum residue levels together with full justification and estimations of the potential and actual exposure through diet and other means. Annex VI, Part B, Section 2.4.2 and Part C, Section 2.5 of Directive 91/414/EEC provides for Member States to evaluate the information submitted concerning impact on human or animal health arising from residues and the impact on the environment and to take decisions on authorisations which ensure that residues occurring reflect the minimum quantities of the plant protection product necessary to achieve adequate control corresponding to good agricultural practice, applied in such a manner that the residues at harvest, slaughter or after storage, as appropriate, are reduced to a minimum.
(6) New data has been provided for uses of azoxystrobin on rice, bananas, tomatoes and cucurbits with edible and inedible peel. This new data has been evaluated and it is considered appropriate to revise the provisional maximum residue levels fixed for these products in Directive 1999/71/EC.
(7) At the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC the technical and scientific evaluation of azoxystrobin was finalised on 22 April 1998 in the format of the Commission review report for azoxystrobin. In this review report the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for azoxystrobin was set at 0,1 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with azoxystrobin has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(8) and it has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed in this Directive do not give rise to an exceedence of this ADI.
(8) Acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an acute reference dose were not noted during the evaluation and discussion that preceded the inclusion of azoxystrobin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) The Community's trading partners have been consulted about the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels have been considered. The possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the submission of acceptable data.
(10) The advice and recommendations of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.
(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2000/48/EC of 25 July 2000 amending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables respectively (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following shall be added to part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:\n\n"">TABLE>""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe maximum residues levels in the Annex to this Directive shall replace those listed for azoxystrobin in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (1), and in particular Article 27(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 27 of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 may be granted under certain conditions to Community tuna producer organisations for quantities of tuna delivered to the processing industry during the calendar quarter for which prices were recorded, where both the average quarterly selling price recorded on the Community market and the import price plus any countervailing charge were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price for the product concerned.
(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market has shown that between 1 January and 31 March 2004 both the average quarterly selling price and the import price as referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing not more than 10 kg each and skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price in force, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2346/2002 (2).
(3) Entitlement to the compensatory allowance should be determined on the basis of sales which are covered by invoices bearing a date falling within the quarter concerned and which have been used to calculate the average monthly selling price in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2183/2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting the compensatory allowance for tuna intended for the processing industry (3).
(4) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 the level of the compensation may not in any case exceed either the difference between the triggering threshold and the average selling price of the product in question on the Community market or a flat-rate amount equivalent to 12 % of that threshold.
(5) The quantities on which compensation is payable may under no circumstances, for the quarter concerned, exceed the limits laid down in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.
(6) The quantities of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing not more than 10 kg each and skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) sold and delivered to the processing industry established in the customs territory of the Community were higher during the quarter concerned than the quantities sold and delivered during the same quarter of the three previous fishing years. Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should be limited.
(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 fishing years.

amending Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’),
Having regard to Article 1(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 of 25 July 2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (2),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005, the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of castings of non-malleable cast iron of a kind used to cover and/or give access to ground or sub-surface systems, and parts thereof, whether or not machined, coated or painted or fitted with other materials, excluding fire hydrants, originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’) (‘the product concerned’), normally declared within CN codes 7325 10 50, 7325 10 92 and ex 7325 10 99 (Taric code 7325109910). Given the large number of cooperating parties, a sample of Chinese exporting producers was selected during the investigation which led to the imposition of the measures.
(2) The sampled companies were attributed the individual duty rates established during the investigation. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (‘MET’), in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, were attributed the 0 % anti-dumping duty which was established for the sole sampled company which was granted MET. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (‘IT’), in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, received the weighted average duty of 28,6 % established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A countrywide duty of 47,8 % was imposed on all other companies.
(3) Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 gives the possibility to Chinese exporting producers which meet the four criteria set out in that Article to be granted the same treatment as the one mentioned in recital (2) above for the cooperating companies not included in the sample (‘New Exporting Producer Treatment’ or ‘NEPT’).
B.   NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS’ REQUESTS
(4) Six companies have requested to be granted NEPT. One company subsequently withdrew its request in the course of the investigation.
(5) An examination has been carried out to determine whether each of the applicants fulfils the criteria for being granted NEPT as set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005, by verifying that:
1. it did not export to the Community the product concerned during the investigation period on which the measures are based (1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004) (the first criterion);
2. it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (the second criterion);
3. it has actually exported to the Community the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of the product concerned to the Community (the third criterion);
4. it operates under market economy conditions defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively that it fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty applied in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation (the fourth criterion).
(6) Since the fourth criterion implies that the applicants submit a claim for Market Economy Treatment (‘MET’) and/or Individual Treatment (‘IT’), the Commission sent MET and IT claim forms to all Chinese applicants. Five Chinese applicant companies requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation. One company requested only IT pursuant to Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(7) Questionnaires were sent to all applicants who were asked to supply evidence to demonstrate that they met the criteria mentioned above.
(8) Exporting producers fulfilling these criteria may, pursuant to Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005, be granted either the 0 % duty rate applicable to companies to whom MET was granted in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, or the weighted average duty rate of 28,6 % applicable to companies to whom individual IT was granted in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(9) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the determination of the fulfilment of the four criteria set out in Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005.
C.   FINDINGS
(10) The examination of the requests established that two companies did not export the product concerned to the Community after the investigation period on which the measures are based, nor did they enter into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export the product concerned to the Community. These companies did not meet the third criterion mentioned in recital (5) above and therefore could not be granted NEPT.
(11) Two Chinese exporting producers could not show that they were not related to exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005; indeed they could not successfully rebut evidence pointing to such a relationship. These companies did not meet the second criterion mentioned in recital (5) above and therefore could not be granted NEPT.
(12) One Chinese exporting producer, Weifang Stable Casting, that only requested IT, provided sufficient evidence to prove that it meets all the four criteria mentioned at recital (5) above. This company in fact could prove that i) it did not export to the Community the product concerned during the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, ii) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005, iii) it actually exported a significant quantity of the product concerned to the Community starting from the year 2008, iv) it fulfils all the requirements for IT and can therefore be granted an individual duty in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, this producer could be granted the weighted average duty rate for companies granted IT applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 28,6 %) in accordance with Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005, and be added to the list of exporting producers in Article 1(2) of that Regulation.
D.   MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES
(13) In consideration of the findings of the investigation as indicated in recital (12) above, it is concluded that the company Weifang Stable Casting should be added to the list of companies individually mentioned under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 with a duty rate of 28,6 %.
(14) All the applicants and the Community Industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments. Their comments were taken into account where appropriate,","{'header': '8.4.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 94/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 282/2009\nof 6 April 2009\namending Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 shall be replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, for products described in paragraph 1 and produced in the People’s Republic of China by the companies listed below shall be as follows:\nCompany\nAnti-dumping duty\n(%)\nTaric additional code\nShijiazhuang Transun Metal Products Co.

of 23 May 2003
amending Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002 as regards registration of imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings produced by one Argentinian exporting producer
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(3) (the ""definitive Regulation""), the Council imposed an anti-dumping duty of 34,8 % on imports of threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings (malleable fittings) originating in Brazil.
(2) On 12 August 2002, the Commission received a request, pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the ""basic Regulation""), from the Defence Committee of the Malleable Cast Iron Pipe Fittings Industry of the European Union. The request alleged the existence of circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by the definitive Regulation on imports of malleable fittings originating in Brazil. According to the request, the circumvention practice consisted of transhipment of malleable fittings originating in Brazil via Argentina to the Community. This request was submitted on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of malleable fittings and contained sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation.
(3) The Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002(4) (the ""initiating Regulation"").
(4) Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, Article 2 of the initiating Regulation instructed the customs authorities to register imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina, whether declared as originating in Argentina or not, as of 26 September 2002.
(5) Article 2(3) of the initiating Regulation provided that imports should be exempted from registration if the exporters having applied for an exemption of registration were found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties.
B. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION
(6) Within the deadlines laid down in Article 3 of the initiating Regulation, the Commission received a request for exemption from the registration and measures from one exporting producer, DEMA SA, San Justo, Buenos Aires.
(7) In December 2002, one month after the expiry of the deadline for receipt of replies to the questionnaire, the Commission received a submission on behalf of Industrias Aguila Blanca SA (Argentina), claiming to be a producer of malleable fittings in Argentina. The submission contained a request by this company to be considered as an interested party in the investigation and a request to be exempted from extension of measures. Given that the submission was received at such an advanced stage of the investigation and well beyond the deadlines laid down in Article 3 of the initiating Regulation and, in addition, would have required further explanations and verification, the company was informed that it could not be considered as cooperating in the investigation. Accordingly, the company was informed that findings in respect of it had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation.
(8) Any decision concerning exporters should be limited to exemption from registration at this stage. If the Council subsequently adopts a regulation extending the anti-dumping measures pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, it may also decide to exempt certain exporters from such extended measures.
C. INVESTIGATION PERIOD
(9) The investigation period covered the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002 (the ""IP""). Data were collected from 1998 up to the IP to investigate the change in the pattern of trade.
D. FINDINGS IN RESPECT OF DEMA SA
(10) DEMA SA replied to the questionnaire sent by the Commission in the course of the investigation. The Commission did carry out a verification visit at the premises of DEMA SA.
(11) It is noted that, during the IP, DEMA SA only exported one container to the Community. No other exports to the Community took place during the IP or in the period for which data were collected. In fact, the only export preceding the one during the IP took place in 1992. Therefore, there was no clear pattern of trade prior to or after the imposition of measures concerning Brazilian exports to the Community, and consequently no change thereof. Moreover it has also been established that DEMA SA is a manufacturer and exporter of malleable fittings operating its own production facilities for the complete production process of the product concerned. It only sells its own products and never purchased any malleable fittings from Brazil during the IP. It is therefore considered that DEMA SA demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that it did not circumvent the measures imposed on malleable fittings originating in Brazil.
(12) In the light of the above findings, registration of imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina and produced by DEMA SA should cease.
(13) The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to amend its initiating Regulation in so far as it provides for the registration of imports of malleable fittings consigned from Argentina (whether declared as originating in Argentina or not).
(14) This Regulation is based on findings specific to DEMA SA and does not prejudge any decision which the Council may take to extend the existing anti-dumping measures on malleable fittings originating in Brazil to the same product consigned from Argentina (whether declared as originating in Argentina or not).
(15) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to cease the registration of imports of malleable fittings produced by DEMA SA and were given the opportunity to comment. No objections were received,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 909/2003 of 23 May 2003 amending Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002 as regards registration of imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings produced by one Argentinian exporting producer', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following paragraph shall be added to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1693/2002:\n\n""4.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2585/2001(2), and in particular Articles 30 and 33 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 347/2002(3) opens the crisis distillation provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for a maximum quantity of 4 million hectolitres of table wine in France.
(2) In view of the market situation for table wine in France, that maximum quantity should be adjusted and set at 3,85 million hectolitres.
(3) According to information received from the French authorities, the distillation contracts concluded between producers and distillers from 1 March to 29 March 2002 cover a total volume of 2,349 million hectolitres. France therefore requests the opening of a new period for concluding contracts for a volume of 1,501 million hectolitres to dispose of the surplus stocks which continue to severely depress the market as the next harvest approaches.
(4) The level of crisis distillation contracts concluded in France in March has not produced the full desired results because it was also possible to sell wine to merchants, although in some cases at prices lower than those paid for distillation, but on favourable take-over and payment terms. These terms have led producers facing cash-flow difficulties to conclude sales contracts to the detriment of deliveries of wine for crisis distillation. At present merchants have probably largely covered their requirements for the year and thus no further major selling of wine is likely. Also, the outlook for the next harvest does not suggest that production is likely to fall significantly.
(5) In addition, updated market data confirm the need to withdraw approximately 3,85 million hectolitres in order to reduce stocks of table wine to an acceptable level in anticipation of the next harvest. Wine prices have not increased, except temporarily in March when crisis distillation was opened. Since then they have fallen again. The stocks still held by producers must therefore be disposed of as quickly as possible.
(6) In conclusion, the conditions for selling wine when crisis distillation was opened last March prevented that measure from having its full effect. Producers were able to find buyers for their wine on interesting payment and delivery terms, even at low prices. These effects no longer exist, and the only decisive factor is now quantity. Producers must therefore eliminate their surplus stocks before the next harvest while there are few opportunities for selling them on the market.

(1) The second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 establishes the criteria for setting the aid for the cultivation of grapes intended for the production of dried grapes of the sultana and Muscatel varieties and currants.
(2) The third subparagraph of Article 7(1) of that Regulation states that the amount of aid may be differentiated according to grape variety. It also states that that amount may also be differentiated according to other factors which may affect yields.

(3) For the 2003/04 marketing year, verification of the areas used to grow the grapes referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 has revealed no overrun of the maximum guaranteed area laid down in Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1621/1999 of 22 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the aid for the cultivation of grapes to produce certain varieties of dried grapes (2).

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 provides for the establishment, for the beef and veal sector and for the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994, of the quantities of the specific supply balances for the Azores and Madeira with beef and veal, male bovines for fattening and pure-bred breeding animals;
Whereas the quantities of products benefiting from the specific supply arrangements must be determined within the framework of periodic forecast supply balances which may be adjusted on the basis of the essential requirements of the markets and taking account of local production and traditional trade flows; whereas to ensure coverage of requirements in terms of quantity, price and quality and to ensure that the proportion of products supplied from the Community is preserved, the aid to be granted for products originating in the rest of the Community must be determined on terms equivalent, for the end user, to the advantage resulting from exemption from import duties on imports of products from third countries;
Whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 provides for the number of imported bovines for fattening to be determined degressively to take account of the development of local production; whereas, owing to the increasing local consumption of beef and veal linked to the development of tourism which has led to an increase in the supply balance quantities for the 1992/93 marketing year, a degree of degressivity should be applied during the period 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 which takes account of these local market needs;

(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (2) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ‘cereal products’, namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ‘other cereals’, these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) The current situation on the cereals market and, in particular, the supply prospects mean that the export refunds should be abolished.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 4 December 2012
abrogating Decision 2009/587/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Malta
(2012/778/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 7 July 2009, by Decision 2009/587/EC (1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in Malta. The Council noted that the general government deficit in Malta had reached 4,7 % of GDP in 2008, thus largely exceeding the 3 % of GDP reference value, while general government gross debt had been above the 60 % of GDP reference value since 2003 and stood at 64,1 % of GDP in 2008 (2).
(2) Also on 7 July 2009, on the basis of a recommendation by the Commission, the Council addressed a recommendation to Malta in accordance with Article 104(7) TEC and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (3), with a view to bringing an end to this situation by 2010 at the latest. The recommendation was made public.
(3) On 16 February 2010, on the basis of a Commission recommendation, the Council concluded that effective action had been taken in compliance with its recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC but that unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances had occurred in Malta after the adoption of its recommendation. The Council therefore adopted a revised recommendation in accordance with Article 126(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) to Malta, extending the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit by one year, i.e. to 2011. The recommendation was made public.
(4) Pursuant to Article 126(12) TFEU, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(5) Pursuant to Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the TFEU, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of that Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4).
(6) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated, the Council should take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 % of GDP threshold over the forecast horizon.
(7) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 following the notification by Malta before 1 April 2012 and on the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:
— After the peak in 2008, the general government deficit has narrowed gradually, reaching 2,7 % of GDP in 2011, below the 3 % of GDP reference value. The significant improvement compared to 2010, when the general government deficit was 3,6 % of GDP, was mainly due to an increase in revenues by 0,7 % of GDP. The impact of net deficit-reducing one-off measures in 2011 is estimated in the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast at 0,7 % of GDP. The structural balance, i.e. the cyclically-adjusted budgetary balance net of one-off and temporary measures, is estimated to have improved by 1 percentage point of GDP in 2011, above the requested effort of at least ¾ % of GDP recommended by the Council.
— The Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast projects the deficit to fall further to 2,6 % of GDP in 2012, mainly thanks to revenue-increasing measures, most of which are considered to be of a one-off nature; the net deficit-reducing impact of one-offs is estimated at 1 % of GDP. On a no-policy change basis, i.e. without incorporating the consolidation measures contained in the 2013 budget, which was adopted after the cut-off date of the forecast, the general government deficit is projected to widen to 2,9 % of GDP in 2013, before narrowing again, to 2,6 % of GDP, in 2014, thus remaining below the 3 % of GDP reference value over the forecast horizon. The April 2012 Stability Programme targets lower deficits, of 2,2 %, 1,7 % and 1,1 % of GDP in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The difference between the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast and the Stability Programme target for 2012 is mainly explained by more dynamic revenue growth in the latter.
— In the years after the 2011 deadline set by the Council, the budgetary projections of the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast point to no improvement of the cyclically-adjusted budget balance, net of one-off and other temporary measures, in 2012 and to an improvement of ¼ percentage point of GDP in 2013. This is below the 0,5 % of GDP benchmark for the adjustment towards the medium-term budgetary objective required under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies (5). This slow adjustment is projected against broadly balanced cyclical conditions, i.e. the output gap is estimated to be close to zero. At the same time, the composition of growth is expected to be relatively tax-revenue-poor. Especially in 2012, economic growth is driven by net exports, while domestic demand is projected to be rather weak compared to the past trends. In 2014, the improvement is projected to amount to ½ percentage point of GDP. Furthermore, in 2012, the real growth rate of government expenditure, net of discretionary revenue measures, is projected to be below the benchmark reference medium-term rate of potential GDP growth, as defined in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1466/97. However, on a no-policy-change basis, the real net growth in expenditure would significantly breach this benchmark reference rate in 2013 and 2014.
— General government gross debt as a share of GDP has been on an increasing trend since 2008 and reached 70,9 % of GDP in 2011. The Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast projects the debt ratio to continue increasing to reach 72,4 % of GDP in 2012, 73,1 % of GDP in 2013 and 72,8 % of GDP in 2014. By contrast, the 2012 Stability Programme projects the debt ratio to start decreasing after 2011, to 67,4 % of GDP by 2014. The difference between the two projections is due to a lower primary surplus and higher stock-flow adjustment in the autumn forecast.
(8) The Council recalls that, starting in 2012, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, and for a period of three years, Malta should make sufficient progress towards compliance with the requirement under the debt criterion, in accordance with Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97.
(9) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in Malta has been corrected by the 2011 deadline and Decision 2009/587/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '14.12.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 342/43', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 4 December 2012\nabrogating Decision 2009/587/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Malta\n(2012/778/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 7 July 2009, by Decision 2009/587/EC(1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in Malta.

As part of the application of that Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(4).\n\n((6)) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated, the Council should take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3\xa0% of GDP threshold over the forecast horizon.\n\n((7)) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 following the notification by Malta before 1 April 2012 and on the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:—After the peak in 2008, the general government deficit has narrowed gradually, reaching 2,7\xa0% of GDP in 2011, below the 3\xa0% of GDP reference value. The significant improvement compared to 2010, when the general government deficit was 3,6\xa0% of GDP, was mainly due to an increase in revenues by 0,7\xa0% of GDP. The impact of net deficit-reducing one-off measures in 2011 is estimated in the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast at 0,7\xa0% of GDP. The structural balance, i.e. the cyclically-adjusted budgetary balance net of one-off and temporary measures, is estimated to have improved by 1 percentage point of GDP in 2011, above the requested effort of at least ¾\xa0% of GDP recommended by the Council.—The Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast projects the deficit to fall further to 2,6\xa0% of GDP in 2012, mainly thanks to revenue-increasing measures, most of which are considered to be of a one-off nature; the net deficit-reducing impact of one-offs is estimated at 1\xa0% of GDP. On a no-policy change basis, i.e. without incorporating the consolidation measures contained in the 2013 budget, which was adopted after the cut-off date of the forecast, the general government deficit is projected to widen to 2,9\xa0% of GDP in 2013, before narrowing again, to 2,6\xa0% of GDP, in 2014, thus remaining below the 3\xa0% of GDP reference value over the forecast horizon. The April 2012 Stability Programme targets lower deficits, of 2,2\xa0%, 1,7\xa0% and 1,1\xa0% of GDP in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The difference between the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast and the Stability Programme target for 2012 is mainly explained by more dynamic revenue growth in the latter.—In the years after the 2011 deadline set by the Council, the budgetary projections of the Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast point to no improvement of the cyclically-adjusted budget balance, net of one-off and other temporary measures, in 2012 and to an improvement of ¼ percentage point of GDP in 2013. This is below the 0,5\xa0% of GDP benchmark for the adjustment towards the medium-term budgetary objective required under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, in particular Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 of 7 July 1997 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies(5). This slow adjustment is projected against broadly balanced cyclical conditions, i.e. the output gap is estimated to be close to zero. At the same time, the composition of growth is expected to be relatively tax-revenue-poor. Especially in 2012, economic growth is driven by net exports, while domestic demand is projected to be rather weak compared to the past trends. In 2014, the improvement is projected to amount to ½ percentage point of GDP. Furthermore, in 2012, the real growth rate of government expenditure, net of discretionary revenue measures, is projected to be below the benchmark reference medium-term rate of potential GDP growth, as defined in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1466/97. However, on a no-policy-change basis, the real net growth in expenditure would significantly breach this benchmark reference rate in 2013 and 2014.—General government gross debt as a share of GDP has been on an increasing trend since 2008 and reached 70,9\xa0% of GDP in 2011. The Commission services’ 2012 autumn forecast projects the debt ratio to continue increasing to reach 72,4\xa0% of GDP in 2012, 73,1\xa0% of GDP in 2013 and 72,8\xa0% of GDP in 2014. By contrast, the 2012 Stability Programme projects the debt ratio to start decreasing after 2011, to 67,4\xa0% of GDP by 2014. The difference between the two projections is due to a lower primary surplus and higher stock-flow adjustment in the autumn forecast.\n\n(—) After the peak in 2008, the general government deficit has narrowed gradually, reaching 2,7\xa0% of GDP in 2011, below the 3\xa0% of GDP reference value. The significant improvement compared to 2010, when the general government deficit was 3,6\xa0% of GDP, was mainly due to an increase in revenues by 0,7\xa0% of GDP.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of dicopper chloride trihydroxide. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of dicopper chloride trihydroxide as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 6 September 2011 (2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, dicopper chloride trihydroxide does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use may be considered as an effective source of copper for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of dicopper chloride trihydroxide shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '27.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 89/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 269/2012\nof 26 March 2012\nconcerning the authorisation of dicopper chloride trihydroxide as feed additive for all animal species\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of dicopper chloride trihydroxide.
