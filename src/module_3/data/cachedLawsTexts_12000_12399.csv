Measuring instruments\n\nThe noise emitted by tractors shall be measured by means of a sound-level meter of the type described in Publication 179, 1st Edition (1965) of the International Electrotechnical Commission.\n\nI.3. Conditions of measurement\n\nMeasurements shall be made on unladen tractors in a sufficiently silent and open area (ambient noise and wind noise at least 10 dB (A) below the noise being measured).\n\nThis area may take the form, for instance, of an open space of 50 metre radius having a central part of at least 20 metres radius which is practically level ; it may be surfaced with concrete, asphalt, or similar material and may not be covered with powdery snow, tall grass, loose soil or ashes.\n\nThe surface of the test track shall be such as not to cause excessive tyre noise. This condition applies only to measurement of the noise made by tractors in motion.\n\nMeasurement shall be carried out in fine weather with little wind. No person other than the observer taking the readings from the apparatus may remain near the tractor or the microphone, as the presence of spectators near either the tractor or the microphone may considerably affect the readings from the apparatus. Marked fluctuations of the pointer which appear to be unrelated to the characterstics of the general sound level shall be ignored in taking readings.\n\nI.4. Method of measurement      I.4.1. Measurement of noise of tractors in motion (for type-approval).\n\nAt least two measurements shall be made on each side of the tractor. Preliminary measurements may be made for adjustment purposes but shall be disregarded.\n\nThe microphone shall be situated 1 72 metres above ground level at a distance of 7 75 metres from the path of the tractor\'s centre line, CC, measured along the perpendicular PP\' to that line (figure 1).\n\nTwo lines AA\' and BB\', parallel to line PP\' and situated respectively 10 metres forward and 10 metres rearward of the line, shall be marked out on the test track. Tractors shall approach line AA\' at a steady speed, as specified below. The throttle shall then be  fully opened as rapidly as practicable and held in the fully opened position until the rear of the tractor (1) crosses line BB\' ; the throttle shall then be closed again as rapidly as possible.\n\nThe maximum sound level recorded shall constitute the result of the measurement.        I.4.1.1. The test speed shall be three-quarters of the maximum speed which can be attained in the highest gear used for road movement.\n\nI.4.1.2. Interpretation of results        I.4.1.2.1. To take account of inaccuracies in the measuring instruments, the result obtained from each measurement shall be determined by deducting 1 dB (A) from the meter reading.\n\nI.4.1.2.2. Measurements shall be considered valid if the difference between two consecutive measurements on the same side of the tractor does not exceed 2 dB (A).\n\nI.4.1.2.3. The highest sound level measured shall constitute the test result. Should that result exceed by 1 dB (A) the maximum permissible sound level for the category of tractor tested, two further measurements shall be made. Three of the four measurements thus obtained must fall within the prescribed limits. >PIC FILE= ""T0005499"">   (1)If the tractor includes a trailer, this shall not be taken into account in determining when line BB\' is crossed.\n\nI.4.2. Measurement of noise of stationary tractors (not required for type-approval).      I.4.2.1. Position of sound-level meter\n\nMeasurements shall be made at point X (shown in figure 2) at a distance of 7 metres from the nearest surface of the tractor.\n\nThe microphone shall be situated 1 72 metres above ground level.\n\nI.4.2.2. Number of measurements\n\nAt least two measurements shall be made.\n\nI.4.2.3. Tractor test conditions\n\nThe engine of a tractor without a speed governor shall be run at three-quarters of the rpm speed at which, according to the tractor manufacturer, it develops its maximum power. The rpm speed of the engine shall be measured by means of an independent instrument, e.g. a roller bed and a tachometer. If the engine is fitted with a governor preventing the engine from exceeding the speed at which it develops its maximum power, it shall be run at the maximum speed permitted by the governor.\n\nBefore taking any measurements, the engine shall be brought to its normal running temperature.\n\nI.4.2.4. Interpretation of results\n\nAll sound-level readings recorded shall be given in the report.\n\nThe method used to calculate the engine power shall also be shown where possible. The state of loading of the tractor must also be given.\n\nThe measurements shall be considered valid if the difference between two consecutive measurements on the same side of the tractor does not exceed 2 dB (A).\n\nThe maximum figure recorded shall constitute the result of the measurement. >PIC FILE= ""T0005500"">\n\nII. EXHAUST SYSTEM (SILENCER)    II.1. If the tractor is fitted with a device designed to reduce the exhaust noise (silencer), the requirements of this Item II shall apply. If the inlet of the engine is fitted with an air filter which is necessary in order to ensure compliance with the permissible sound level, the filter shall be considered to be part of the silencer, and the requirements of this Item II shall also apply to that filter.\n\nII.2. A drawing of the exhaust system must be annexed to the tractor type-approval certificate\n\nII.3. The silencer must be marked with a reference to its make and type which is clearly legible and indelible.\n\nII.4. The use of fibrous absorbent material is permitted in the construction of silencers only if the following conditions are fulfilled:      II.4.1.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 23(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Commission received on 24 April 2013 an application from ITAB for the approval of sucrose as basic substance. That application was accompanied by the information required by the second subparagraph of Article 23(3).
(2) The Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) for scientific assistance. The Authority presented to the Commission a Technical Report on the substance concerned on 12 June 2014 (2). The Commission presented the review report (3) and the draft of this Regulation on the approval of sucrose to the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed on 11 July 2014.
(3) The documentation provided by the applicant shows that sucrose fulfils the criteria of a foodstuff as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Moreover, it is not predominantly used for plant protection purposes but nevertheless is useful in plant protection in a product consisting of the substance and water. Consequently, it is to be considered as a basic substance.
(4) It has appeared from the examinations made that sucrose may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve sucrose as a basic substance.
(5) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions for the approval which are detailed in Annex I to this Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For sodium silver thiosulfate, referred to in Commission Decision 2003/850/EC (3) as silver thiosulfate, the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by that Decision.
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 27 January 2003 an application from Enhold B.V for the inclusion of the active substance sodium silver thiosulfate in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2003/850/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 4 July 2005. In accordance with Article 11(6) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 (4) additional information was requested from the applicant on 1 February 2012. The evaluation of the additional data by the Netherlands was submitted in the format of an updated draft assessment report in November 2012.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance sodium silver thiosulfate (5) on 1 March 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 3 October 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for sodium silver thiosulfate.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing sodium silver thiosulfate may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve sodium silver thiosulfate.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing sodium silver thiosulfate. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(8) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (6) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (7) should be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '26.11.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 315/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1195/2013\nof 22 November 2013\napproving the active substance sodium silver thiosulfate, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC(2)is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Council Decision 2001/549/EC of 16 July 2001 providing macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (2), the Community granted to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a long-term loan of up to EUR 225 million with a view to ensuring a sustainable balance-of-payments situation and strengthening the country’s reserve position. The loan was fully disbursed by the Commission in one instalment in October 2001.
(2) Pursuant to Council Decision 2002/882/EC of 5 November 2002 providing further macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (3), the Community granted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia a loan of up to EUR 55 million with a view to ensuring a sustainable balance-of-payments situation and strengthening the country’s reserve position. The loan was fully disbursed by the Commission in three instalments of respectively EUR 10 million in February 2003, EUR 30 million in September 2003 and EUR 15 million in April 2005.
(3) According to the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro adopted on 4 February 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was reconstituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
(4) On 3 June 2006, based on Article 60 of the Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and following the Montenegrin referendum of 21 May 2006, the Parliament of Montenegro passed a declaration on the independence of the country, which stated that Montenegro is an independent state with full legal personality under international law.
(5) The Parliament of Serbia adopted on 5 June 2006 a decision that defined Serbia as the successor state to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.
(6) The Council, in its conclusions of 12 June 2006, took note of the declaration of the Parliament of Montenegro and the decision of the Parliament of Serbia and stated that the European Union and the Member States had decided to develop further relations with Montenegro as a sovereign and independent state.
(7) On 10 July 2006, Montenegro and Serbia entered into an agreement on the regulation of membership in international financial organisations and the distribution of financial assets and liabilities, according to which macro-financial assistance loans granted to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro should continue to be serviced in the proportion of 90 % for Serbia and 10 % for Montenegro, unless other percentages are to be used on the basis of the final beneficiary principle.
(8) Montenegro and Serbia are, via the Central Bank of Montenegro and the National Bank of Serbia, continuing to discharge fully the debt servicing obligations stemming from the Community loan operations.
(9) According to Appendix 4 to the Agreement of 10 July 2006 between Montenegro and Serbia a total debt of EUR 6 703 388,62 stemming from the macro-financial assistance loans has been attributed to Montenegro.
(10) The two countries are discharging the debt servicing obligations in accordance with the 90:10 division agreed between them, with the exception of one operation which is being serviced following the final beneficiary principle (99,47 % for Serbia and 0,53 % for Montenegro).
(11) Considering the relations developed between the European Union and Montenegro as an independent state, notably the European Partnership established by Council Decision 2007/49/EC of 22 January 2007 on the principles, priorities and conditions contained in the European Partnership with Montenegro (4), and the long period of time over which repayments are due to take place, the Commission should be authorised to take appropriate action to ensure that the liabilities arising under the loans granted pursuant to Decisions 2001/549/EC and 2002/882/EC are divided between Montenegro and Serbia in the proportions agreed bilaterally between the two countries.
(12) Montenegro or Serbia will not be entitled to any additional disbursement of macro-financial assistance under this Decision.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1608/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/2001(4), extends the applicability of certain Council provisions repealed by Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 until 31 March 2001, pending the finalisation and adoption of measures implementing that Regulation. The finalisation and adoption of those implementing measures will not be completed by 31 March 2001. Certain Council provisions repealed by Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 should accordingly be allowed to stand for a short additional period.
(2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.
(3) Less progress has been made in adopting implementing measures in certain areas than in others, for example regarding the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine products, because of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues the Council has to deal with and the direct impact of any measures adopted on operators in the Community and in non-member countries. Provision should therefore be made for an extra transitional period in order to allow in-depth discussions to be held.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990, laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 434/97 (2), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas D-Phe6-luteinizing-hormone-releasing-hormone and neostigmine should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, ivermectin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

(1) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect public health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(2) The Commission was made aware in September 2008 that high levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China. To counter the health risk that may result from exposure to a high melamine content in feed and food products, Commission Decision 2008/798/EC of 14 October 2008 imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC (2), provides for a prohibition on the importation into the Community of products containing milk or milk products, soya or soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children, and requires Member States to perform systematic checks on all consignments originating in or consigned from China of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products and of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed. In that Decision the level of 2,5 mg/kg was considered to be the appropriate level to distinguish between the unavoidable background presence of melamine and unacceptable adulteration.
(3) The number of Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) notifications, as provided for in Article 2(4) of Decision 2008/798/EC, as regards unacceptable levels of melamine in those food and feed products from China has significantly decreased since January 2009, and the Chinese authorities have provided guarantees as regards the controls on melamine in such products exported to the Community. It is therefore appropriate to review the measures laid down in Decision 2008/798/EC.
(4) Taking into account that products containing milk or milk products, soya or soya products that are intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children represent the primary, and in some cases sole, source of nourishment for infants and young children, it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on importation into the Community of any such products originating from China. Member States should ensure that any such products found on the market are destroyed without delay.
(5) At the same time, systematic checks on all consignments originating in or consigned from China of feed and food containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products and of ammonium bicarbonate intended for food and feed are no longer necessary given the significant decrease in RASFF notifications, so the intensity of physical checks should be reduced. Since the level of 2,5 mg/kg continues to remain appropriate to distinguish between unavoidable background presence of melamine and unacceptable adulteration, products that contain a higher level of melamine should not enter the feed and food chain and should be safely disposed of.
(6) Therefore, Decision 2008/798/EC should be amended accordingly. However, taking into account the nature of the amending provisions, it is appropriate to replace that Decision with a regulation, which could be reviewed at a later stage on the basis of the results of the controls carried out by the Member States.

of 18 February 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95(3) laid down a uniform format for visas.
(2) Measure No 38 of the Vienna Action Plan, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December 1998, states that attention must be given to new technical developments in order to ensure, where appropriate, greater security in the uniform format for visas.
(3) Conclusion No 22 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 states that a common active policy on visas and false documents should be further developed.
(4) The establishment of a uniform visa format is an essential element in the harmonisation of visa policy.
(5) It is necessary to make provision for the establishment of common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas, in particular common rules on the technical methods and standards to be used for filling in the form.
(6) The integration of a photograph produced according to high security standards is a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the uniform format visa and the holder as an important contribution to ensuring that the uniform format for visas is protected even against fraudulent use. The specifications set out in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) document 9303 on machine readable visas will be taken into account.
(7) Common standards relating to the implementation of the uniform format for visas are essential to meet high technical standards and to facilitate detection of forged or falsified visa stickers.
(8) The powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Committee set up by Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 which should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 should therefore be amended.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation to make the uniform format for visas more secure do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.
(11) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.
(12) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(5).
(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 4 December 2001, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(14) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 23 December 1992 on the aid granted for the creation of industrial enterprises in Modane, Savoy (France), considered in the light of Articles 92 and 94 of the EEC Treaty (Only the French text is authentic)
(93/193/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, in accordance with the same provision, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I  Following a written question (No 2832/91), which Mr Mauro Chiabrando, Member of the European Parliament, put to the Commission on 11 November 1991, the Commission sent the French Government a request for information on aid which appeared to have been  granted to industrial enterprises setting up in Modane, Savoy (1).
The Commission received no reply, and accordingly it sent a reminder by letter No 437 of 5 February 1992. The French authorities sent the Commission an interim answer dated 17 February 1992, which was followed by a full answer dated 9 April 1992.
The information provided was incomplete, and too vague to enable the Commission to check whether the aid was compatible with Articles 92 and 93 of the EEC Treaty; on 14 April 1992, therefore, the Commission decided to initiate proceedings under Article  93 (2) of the EEC Treaty to examine the measures in question.
The French authorities were informed accordingly, by letter dated 28 April 1992, and the other Member States and interested parties were informed by means of a notice published in the Official Journal (2).
The French authorities gave an initial reply by letter dated 14 May 1992. On 3 August 1992 they asked to be allowed two months to complete the reply; they sent the Commission their definitive reply on 16 November 1992.
II  In his written question to the Commission Mr Chiabrando described the following arrangements, which he understood applied to enterprises setting up in Modane:
1. a reduction on electricity prices, granted by the regional council of Savoy, of up to 25 % of the cost for a maximum of five years;
2. tax exemptions;
3. recruitment and training aid;
4. financial aid;
- for land development on favourable and negotiable terms,
- for the construction of buildings for lease, rental or sale;
5. grants from the département and region intended substantially to reduce the cost of these buildings.
In their letters of 14 May and 16 November 1992 the French authorities provided clarification and argument in support of their position on points 2 to 5 above.
As regards the reduction in electricity prices referred to in point 1, the French authorities supplied the legal basis of the aid and a draft amendment to it, and figures for reductions already granted.
The Commission analysed the two aspects separately, that is to say:
A. points 2 to 5 above;
B. the reductions in electricity prices: here the Commission considered the new draft Order and the force of established practices, namely the concessions already granted to enterprises under the Mountain Areas Law since it entered into force on 31  March 1987.
III   A   Tax exemptions  These are exemptions or reductions in business tax and succession and gift duties, which are granted by local authorities; the mechanisms and various implementing orders were authorized by the Commission in 1982, at the same time as the  regional planning grant (PAT) scheme. The concessions cannot be granted for more than five years, and relate mainly to business start-up and expansion operations.
Recruitment and training  The measure at issue here is a general scheme administered by public bodies throughout France. The Aid is awarded not to firms but to employed persons or job seekers and accordingly does not constitute State aid within the  meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty.
Financial aid for land development and the construction of buildings, and local authority grants to reduce the cost of buildings  These measures are administered in the canton of Modane by the département and region and by Sofirem, one of the  Charbonnages de France coalmining conversion corporations.
- Sofirem
Sofirem is a conversion corporation whose activities were approved by the Commission on 31 May 1989; it provides loans on favourable terms, takes shareholdings, and provides advisory services, mainly in the French coalfields. On 27 September 1990 the  Commission authorized the extension of its activities to Modane on the following conditions: it was to assist only firms with a staff of no more than 100 and a turnover of no more than ECU 10 million, and the aid granted was not to exceed a gross  intensity of 7,5 %. Sofirem has complied with these conditions.
- The département and region
Local authorities can provide assistance in Modane under Article 1 of Order No 82-809 of 22 September 1982, which was approved by the Commission at the same time as the PAT scheme; it allows them to acquire buildings, to renovate them, and then to  lease, rent or sell them at market prices.
B   Reductions on electricity prices  The reductions are given under Order No 87/214 of 25 March 1987 on the power and energy reserved provided for in Article 10 of the Hydraulic Energy Law of 16 October 1919, as amended by Article 91 of the Mountain Areas  Law, No 85-30 of 9 January 1985.
The Hydraulic Energy Law states that where a concession is granted for the operation of a hydroelectric power station, part of the power available must be reserved for the local area, as a public service obligation.
The Mountain Areas Law also allows certain firms to enjoy a reduction on energy prices, by decision of the regional council in accordance with machinery to be established by order.
Lastly, Order No 87-214 lays down the criteria for determining which firms are eligible and provides that the reduction granted is to be 25 % of the price.
Under the Order, manufacturing and craft firms are eligible for the price reduction where they:
- invest in connection with the creation of a business, a take-over of a business in difficulty, the expansion of a business or the internal conversion of a business,
and
- undertake to create or maintain a number of permanent or seasonal jobs which is no lower than a threshold periodically determined by the regional council.
The regions which qualify are mountain areas, defined in terms of high altitude or steeply sloping terrain, and are not all eligible for regional aid.
The mechanism described here constitutes operating aid: the Commission will sometimes authorize aid of this kind in areas which qualify for assistance pursuant to Article 92 (3) (a) of the EEC Treaty, but never in areas which qualify pursuant to Article  92 (3) (c) - still less in areas which do not qualify for regional aid, which is the case in the canton of Modane.
In their letter of 16 November 1992, however, the French authorities sent the Commission a draft Order amending Order No 87-214. Under the new Order the electricity price reduction could not total more than FF 350 000 (ECU 50 000) per firm over three  years. The Order would also exclude 'manufacturing enterprises governed by special Community rules on State aid'.
Reductions already granted to firms under the Mountain Areas Law since it entered into force on 31 March 1987  The scheme was extended to firms only on 31 March 1987; before that it had been confined to public authorities and public services.
The French authorities have calculated the total amount granted in reductions to firms in 1990 and 1991:
/* Tables: see OJ */
IV  In the light of what has been said here, and particularly in point III A and B, the Commission has reached the following conclusions:
- the application to the canton of Modane of the measures described at point III A, that is to say tax exemptions, recruitment and training aid and the measures taken by Sofirem and local authorities under Order No 82-809, merely brings together a  combination of measures which already exist and which have been authorized by the Commission, and is consequently in accordance with Community legislation on State aid,
- the scheme for the reduction of electricity prices under the Mountain Areas Law, described at point III.B, as it would be amended by the draft Order notified to the Commission on 16 November 1992, satisfied the de minimis test set out in the Community  guidelines on State aid for small and medium-sized enterprises adopted by the Commission on 20 May 1992 (3),
- the total granted in electricity price reductions in Savoy under the Mountain Areas Law is small, at FF 800 000 to nine firms in 1991. The firms involved thus received an average of FF 90 000 each in 1991. It is theoretically possible that one of them  may have received a reduction of more than ECU 50 000 over a three-year period, but it is extremely unlikely that aid on so small a scale might have adversey affected trade between Member States to an extent contrary to the common interest.
Accordingly, on condition that the draft Order notified to the Commission is introduced by 31 March 1993 at the latest, and that the French authorities ensure that the Community rules on the overlapping of aid schemes of minor importance and on the  combination of aid granted for different purposes are complied with, the Commission takes the view that Order No 87-214, as consequently amended, is compatible with the common market,","{'title': '93/193/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 December 1992 on the aid granted for the creation of industrial enterprises in Modane, Savoy (France), considered in the light of Articles 92 and 94 of the EEC Treaty (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market, for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (1) within which those products can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates.
(2) The quota volumes, previously established, for autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order numbers 09.2767, 09.2813, 09.2977, 09.2628, 09.2629 and 09.2635 are insufficient to meet the needs of the Union industry. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased, from 1 July 2011 in the case of the tariff quotas with the order numbers 09.2767 and 09.2813, and from 1 January 2011 in the case of tariff quotas with the order numbers 09.2977, 09.2628, 09.2629 and 09.2635.
(3) Moreover, for the autonomous tariff quota of the Union with the order number 09.2631 the product description should be revised.
(4) In addition, it is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant a tariff quota for the second semester of 2011 in respect of the tariff quota with the order number 09.2947. That quota should therefore be closed with effect from 1 July 2011 and the corresponding row should be deleted from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.
(5) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) On 7 April 1999, the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of steel wire rod originating in Turkey.
(2) The complaint was lodged by Eurofer (the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries), on behalf of Community producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of steel wire rod pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of Decision No 2277/96/ECSC (hereinafter referred to as the basic Decision).
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) The Commission, after consultation, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), accordingly initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of steel wire rod, currently classifiable within CN codes 7213 91 10, 7213 91 41 and 7213 91 49, and originating in Turkey.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the representative users and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. Withdrawal of the complaint and termination of the proceedings
(6) By a letter of 26 June 2000 to the Commission, Eurofer formally withdrew its anti-dumping complaint concerning imports of steel wire rod originating in Turkey.
(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Decision, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of steel wire rod originating in Turkey should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures,",{'title': '2000/512/ECSC: Commission Decision of 11 August 2000 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of steel wire rod originating in Turkey (notified under document number C(2000) 2491)'}

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No1540/98 establishing new rules on aid to shipbuilding (1) (hereinafter the ‘Shipbuilding Regulation’), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments (2) and having regard to their comments,
Whereas:
(1) By letter dated 22 December 2003, registered as received on the same day, the Italian authorities notified the Commission under Article 3(2) of the shipbuilding Regulation (1) of a request to extend the three-year delivery date for a vessel named C.180, for which operating aid has been granted. The ship is being built by Cantieri Navali Termoli SpA. (‘the shipyard’).
(2) By letter dated 30 December 2004, the Commission notified Italy of its decision to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the notified measure.
(3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the measures.
(4) By letters dated 28 January 2005, 1 April 2005, 1 June 2005 and 6 July 2006, registered as received on 2 February 2005, 6 April 2005, 6 June 2005 and 7 July 2005 respectively, Italy requested extensions of the deadline for submitting its comments on the Commission’s decision to initiate proceedings. The Commission replied by letters dated 4 February 2005, 8 April 2005, 29 June 2005 and 17 July 2005 respectively.
(5) Italy submitted its comments by letter dated 26 July 2005, registered as received on 29 July 2005. By letter dated 6 January 2006, the Commission requested additional information. The Italian authorities replied by letters dated 23 January 2006 and 2 February 2006, asking for extensions of the deadline, which the Commission granted by letters dated 27 January 2006 and 9 February 2006. By letter dated 6 March 2006, registered as received on the same day, the Italian authorities submitted the additional information requested and completed their submission by letter dated 6 April 2006.
(6) The Commission received no comments from interested parties.
(7) Italy asked the Commission to agree to an extension of the delivery limit of 31 December 2003, which is laid down in the Shipbuilding Regulation as a condition for receiving contract-related operating aid for ships. The extension requested concerned the delivery of a vessel named C.180, which was being built by Cantieri Navali Termoli SpA., a shipyard located in the Molise region of Italy. The extension originally requested was until 31 October 2004 (10 months).
(8) The shipbuilding contract was signed on 30 December 2000, and delivery was originally scheduled for 30 June 2003. The ship had been ordered by Marnavi SpA., an Italian shipowner, for the transport of chemical and petroleum products. In accordance with Article 3(1) of the Shipbuilding Regulation, the shipowner was promised operating aid of 9 % for this vessel, equivalent to some EUR 3,9 million.
(9) However, according to the Italian authorities, construction took longer than anticipated because of a combination of factors, namely the impact of the events of 11 December 2001, the subsequent need to modify the ship to meet the changed market demands, and two natural disasters — an earthquake and floods. The shipyard therefore had to request an extension of the delivery limit for ship C.180 to a date 10 months over the 31 December 2003 limit laid down in the Shipbuilding Regulation.
(10) In their notification, the Italian authorities refer to the Commission decision of 5 June 2002 authorising a similar extension of the 31 December 2003 delivery limit for cruise ships under construction at Meyer Werft, Papenburg, Germany (the ‘Meyer Werft decision’). Specifically, they emphasise several basic similarities between the two cases in terms of: (i) the reason invoked for the extension (i.e. the impact of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack); (ii) the market concerned (i.e. maritime transport of petroleum and chemical products); and (iii) the consolidated commercial relations between the shipyard and the shipowner (3). In short, they claim that the Meyer Werft decision sets a clear precedent for an exceptional authorisation in this case. Furthermore, they note that on 13 November 2002 the Commission took another decision granting, for similar reasons, an extension of the delivery limit for a cruise ship under construction at Kvaerner Masa yard, Finland (the ‘Kvaerner Masa decision’).
(11) The Italian authorities justify their request by referring to what they describe as exceptional factors which were unforeseeable and external to the shipyard and which resulted in unexpected, substantial and defensible disruptions to the shipyard’s work programme. More specifically, these delays were attributable to the following events (see overview in Table 1):
(i) Impact of the 11 September 2001 events
(ii) Need to modify the ship to meet changed market demands
(iii) Impact of natural disasters
Ship Cause of delay Responsibility Problems Delay Additional months required
(i) Events of 11.9.2001:
— suspension and late reactivation of order
(ii) Technical modifications
(iii) Delays due to natural disasters affecting the Molise region:
— Earthquake on 31.10.2002
— Floods 23 to 25.1.2003
Total More than 26 months More than 2 months
Extension requested 10 months
(12) In deciding to initiate the procedure, the Commission thought it doubtful that any of the causes of delay invoked in this case complied with Article 3(2), second subparagraph, of the Shipbuilding Regulation and so doubted that the measure was compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(e) of the EC Treaty.
(13) In order to allay the doubts expressed by the Commission in the decision to initiate the procedure, the Italian authorities submitted additional explanations and data supporting their views concerning the eligibility of the grounds for extending the delivery limit and the compatibility of the measure in question.
(i) Concerning the impact of the events of 11 September 2001
(ii) Need to modify the ship to meet changed market demands
(iii) Impact of natural disasters (earthquake of 31 October 2002 and floods of 23 to 25 January 2003)
(iv) Suspension of the work on C.180 (ex C.173) in 2004
(14) The Italian authorities conclude that the causes of the delays in this case comply with Article 3(2), second subparagraph, of the Shipbuilding Regulation and that the 10-month extension of the three-year delivery limit as from the date of adoption of the Commission’s final decision is compatible with the common market within the meaning Article 87(3)(e) of the EC Treaty.
(15) According to Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through state resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods is, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, incompatible with the common market. Pursuant to the established case-law of the European Court of Justice, the criterion of trade being affected is met if the recipient firm carries out an economic activity involving trade between Member States.
(16) According to Article 87(3)(e) of the Treaty, categories of aid specified by a decision of the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission may be considered compatible with the common market. The Commission notes that the Council adopted the Shipbuilding Regulation on this basis on 29 June 1998. Although the Shipbuilding Regulation expired on 31 December 2003, its provisions must still be applied in assessing requests for an extension of the delivery limit since the matter concerns aid granted under that Regulation and since the Shipbuilding Framework does not provide any guidance for such requests (14).
(17) The Commission notes that the issue of the extension of the delivery limit is decisive for establishing the admissibility of the contract in question for operating aid under Article 3 of the Shipbuilding Regulation. The operating aid in question consists of financing from state resources for some of the costs that the yard in question would normally have to bear when building a vessel. Moreover, shipbuilding is an economic activity involving trade between Member States. Therefore, the aid in question falls within the scope of Article 87(1) of the Treaty.
(18) According to the Shipbuilding Regulation, ‘shipbuilding’ means the building of self-propelled seagoing commercial vessels. The vessel built by Cantieri Navali Termoli, a chemical tanker, is a self-propelled seagoing vessel providing specialised maritime services, namely the transportation of chemical and petroleum products, and thus falls within the scope of Article 1(a) of the Regulation.
(19) Article 3(1) of the Shipbuilding Regulation provides for a ceiling of 9 % for contract-related operating aid for ships until 31 December 2000. According to Article 3(2), the aid ceiling applicable to the contract is that in force on the date on which the final contract is signed. However, this does not apply to ships delivered more than three years after the signing of the contract. In such cases, the ceiling applicable is that in force three years before the date of delivery of the ship. Therefore, the last delivery date for a vessel still to qualify for operating aid was, in principle, 31 December 2003.
(20) The proposed aid for the vessel in question would be granted under Article 3 of Law No 88 of 16 March 2001, authorised by the Commission, as state aid No 502/00. It amounts to some EUR 3,9 million for ship C.180, which is no more than 9 % of the contract value.
(21)(22) Article 3(2), second subparagraph, third sentence, of the Shipbuilding Regulation stipulates that: ‘the Commission may, however, grant an extension of the three-year delivery limit when this is found justified by the technical complexity of the individual shipbuilding project concerned or by delays resulting from unexpected disruptions of a substantial and defensible nature in the working programme of a yard due to exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company.’ The Commission notes that the extension is sought because Cantieri Navali Termoli could not finish the vessel referred to above on account of unexpected delays external to the company.The Shipbuilding Regulation requires that the circumstances justifying the extension of the delivery limit be (a) exceptional, (b) unforeseeable and (c) external to the company. What must also be established is (d) causality between these events and the unforeseen disruptions which caused the delay, (e) their duration and (f) the substantial and defensible nature of these disruptions. The following paragraphs set out the assessment of the arguments invoked by the Italian authorities.
(i) Impact of the events of 11 September 2001
(ii) Need to modify the ship to meet changed market demands
(iii) Impact of the natural disasters which hit the Molise region, where the yard is located
(23) Consequently, the Commission considers that the exceptional circumstances described above have not had an impact on the specific programme of work on the ship in question that would justify the requested 10-month extension to the delivery limit. Therefore, the arguments set out in (i) to (iii) cannot be accepted.
(24) Given the lack of substantial evidence, the extension cannot be authorised on these grounds.
(iv) Suspension of work on C.180 (ex C.173) in 2004
(25) In the light of the above, the Commission finds that the measure under examination constitutes state aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty. The information submitted by the Italian authorities, including that provided during the formal investigation, has confirmed the Commission’s doubts as to whether the causes of delays invoked in this case satisfied Article 3(2), second subparagraph, of the Shipbuilding Regulation, and so the measure under examination is not compatible with the common market under Article 87(3)(e) of the Treaty.","{'header': '28.12.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 383/53', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 4\xa0July 2006\non State aid which Italy is planning to implement for Cantieri Navali Termoli S.p.A (No C 48/2004 (ex 595/2003))\n(notified under document number C(2006) 2972)\n(Only the Italian text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/948/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID\n\nGROUNDS FOR INITIATING THE PROCEDURE\n\nCOMMENTS OF THE ITALIAN AUTHORITIES\n\nASSESSMENT\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article\xa01', 'text': 'Article\xa01\nThe three-year delivery limit laid down in Article\xa03(2) of Regulation (EC) No\xa01540/98 may not be extended for ship C.180 (ex C.173) built by Cantieri Navali Termoli SpA.\nThe contract-related operating aid for that ship may not, therefore, be implemented.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article\xa02', 'text': 'Article\xa02\nItaly shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article\xa03', 'text': 'Article\xa03\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in foodstuffs of animal origin (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Commission has received a mandate in the framework of Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC to prepare the list of pesticide residues and their maximum levels for approval by the Council;
Whereas pesticide residues may arise in cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin as a result of agricultural practices; whereas it is necessary to take into account relevant data for both authorized pesticide uses and as appropriate supervised trials and animal feeding studies;
Whereas, in order better to estimate dietary intake of pesticide residues, it is prudent to establish simultaneously, where possible, maximum residue levels for individual pesticides in all major components of the diet; whereas these levels represent the use of minimum quantities of pesticide to achieve adequate control, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable;
Whereas, in the light of technical and scientific progress and the requirements of public health and agriculture, it is desirable to amend Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC by adding provisions relating to further pesticide residues for cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin, namely chlormequat, diazinon, dicofol, disulfoton, endosulfan, fenbutatin oxide, fentin, mecarbam, phorate, propoxur, propyzamide, triazophos and triforine;
Whereas, however, data are insufficient by current standards to establish maximum pesticide residue levels for certain pesticide residue/product combinations; whereas, in such cases, a period of time not exceeding four years would seem reasonable for the generation of the necessary data; whereas, therefore, maximum levels should be established on the basis of such data by 30 April 2000 at the latest; whereas failure to provide satisfactory data will normally result in the establishment of levels at the appropriate limit of determination; whereas satisfactory undertakings to generate the necessary data must be given within one year of the adoption of this Directive;
Whereas the maximum residue levels established in this Directive will have to be reviewed in the framework of the re-evaluation of active substances provided for in the work programme established in Article 8 (2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3),","{'title': 'Council Directive 96/33/EC of 21 May 1996 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following pesticide residues shall be added to Part A of Annex II to Directive 86/362/EEC:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nAnnex II to Directive 86/363/EEC shall be amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10(1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under objective 2 is defined in Article 9(6) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9(8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas the last subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopts a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8(3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14(3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 5,944504 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C (96) 4179/2 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 4 October 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Lazio; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9(8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas all required elements for an appropriate assessment of the rules for the implementation and management of the measure 2.3 are not yet available; whereas the financial commitments should therefore be reduced by the corresponding amounts until the said rules are approved by the Commission services;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C (97) 1035/6 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiatives programmes in respect of Italy;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been complied with,","{'title': '98/79/EC: Commission Decision of 22 December 1997 on the approval of the single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Lazio concerned by objective 2 in Italy (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Lazio concerned by objective 2 in Italy, covering the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe single programming document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional policies in Italy;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. upgrading and improvement of the environment,\n\n2. development and strengthening of SMEs,\n\n3. upgrading and development of the territory,\n\n4. strengthening of human resources,\n\n5. technical assistance;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the single programming document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the provisions on financial implementation,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality and an initial evaluation of the latter;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the single programming document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992, establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture (1), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 15 thereof,
Whereas Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 stipulates that, in the event of a serious and unexpected upheaval liable to jeopardize conservation of resources, the Commission shall decide on appropriate measures, which shall last no more than six months, and which shall be communicated to the Member States and to the European Parliament and which shall have immediate effect;
Whereas the most recent scientific information, and in particular, the report of the Advisory Committee for Fisheries Management of the International Council of the Exploration of the Sea, indicates that the stock of herring in the North Sea is outside safe biological limits, that the present fishing mortality is at more than double the level considered to be sustainable, and that recent recruitment of fish to the stock is not sufficient to replenish the stock at present exploitation levels;
Whereas, according to scientific advice from the abovementioned sources, it is necessary to take rapid action to rebuild the spawning stock and to reduce fishing mortality; whereas these measures should consist of a reduction of the catch of herring by fleets fishing for human consumption in 1996 to half the present figures of total allowable catch (TAC) and of a decrease by half of the fishing mortality of herring caught as by catch by other fleets in 1996;
Whereas, given the levels of catch attained at present, the risk exists that the abovementioned objectives cannot be achieved unless very swift management action is taken; whereas if these objectives are not achieved, no fishing of herring in 1997 could take place; whereas it is therefore justified to make use of the powers delegated to the Commission in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92;
Whereas, in accordance with the procedure provided in Articles 2 and 7 of the Fisheries Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway (2), the Community and Norway have held consultations concerning the measures to be taken for North Sea herring; whereas these consultations have been successfully concluded and therefore it is now possible to adopt the necessary measures;
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 3074/95 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1088/96 (4), fixes, for certain stocks or groups of stocks, the TACs, their allocation to Member States and certain conditions under which they may be fished; whereas certain of these stipulations should be modified as far as the stocks in which North Sea herring is caught is concerned,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/96 of 1 July 1996 establishing urgent conservation measures to protect the stock of North Sea herring', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nNotwithstanding Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EC) No 3074/95:\n\n- the TACs, the Community shares, their allocation among Member States, as well as the conditions upon which they may be fished, for the stocks of herring in zones III a, IV a, b and IV c, VII d, are fixed for 1996 as set out in Annex I.\n\nThese limitations shall apply to all catches of herring which are landed, sorted, from the main catch,\n\n- landings of herring which are caught in fisheries for purposes other than human consumption and which are not sorted from the catch are limited in 1996 as set out in Annex II.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nMember States where landings for purposes other than human consumption take place shall ensure that adequate sampling systems are in place in order to monitor effectively the landings of bycatches of herring.\n\nIt shall be prohibited to land fish for purposes other than human consumption in harbours where such a sampling system is not in place.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nMember States shall adopt special control and management measures or any other action concerning the capture, sorting and landing of North Sea herring, with a view to ensuring the observance of catch limitations.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 29 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Valle D'Aosta; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the Italian authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a  single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole  programmation period;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been  complied with,","{'title': ""94/1013/EC: Commission Decision of 16 December 1994 on the approval of the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Valle d'Aosta concerned by Objective 2 in Italy (Only the Italian text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance  in the region of Valle D'Aosta concerned by Objective 2 in Italy, covering the period 1 January  1994 to 31 December 1996, is hereby approved.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Single Programming Document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an  appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional  policies in Italy;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. upgrading of sites and their environment;\n\n2. support structures for enterprise;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the Single Programming Document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the financial implementation provisions,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the  Single Programming Document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or  adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nFor the purpose of indexation, the annual breakdown of the global maximal allocation  foreseen for the assistance from the Structural Funds is as follows:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the Single  Programming Document amounts to a maximum of ECU 6,0 million.\n\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the  Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed  implementing provisions which form an integral part of the Single Programming Document.\n\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 9,0 million for the  public sector and ECU 0,5 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans, in  particular from the ECSC and EIB.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;
Whereas the Council Resolution (1) and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 22 March 1971 on the progressive establishment of economic and monetary union in the Community provided for the establishment of a European Monetary Cooperation Fund to be integrated at a later stage into a Community organization of central banks;
Whereas the Heads of State or of Government meeting in Paris on 19 and 20 October 1972 envisaged that the Fund should be established before 1 April 1973;
Whereas the Council has been informed of the Opinions requested on this subject in the Council Resolution (2) and the Representatives of the Member States, of 21 March 1972, from the Monetary Committee and from the Committee of Governors of the Central Banks;
Whereas the purpose of the Fund must be to contribute to the progressive establishment of an Economic and Monetary Union between the Member States of the European Economic Community, which, in its final stage as regards its monetary aspects will have the following characteristics:    - either the total and irreversible convertibility, at irrevocable parities, of Community currencies against each other,
- or the introduction of a common currency;
Whereas it is necessary to confer immediately on the Fund the responsibility for facilitating both the concertation necessary for the smooth operation of the exchange arrangements introduced in the Community and for the settlement of the positions resulting from interventions in Community currencies, for assuring thereby the multilateralization of intra-Community settlements, and for administering a financing mechanism which combines the mechanism for short-term monetary support contained in the Agreement of 9 February 1970 between the Central Banks of the Community with the mechanism for very short-term financing which was contained in the Agreement of 10 April 1972 between those same Central Banks;
Whereas the conferment of these responsibilities constitutes merely a first stage in the progressive development of the Fund ; whereas it is therefore important that the Statutes of the Fund should be drawn up in such a way as to permit the scope of its activities to be gradually extended;
Whereas it is necessary to establish the Fund if Community objectives are to be attained, in particular as regards the progressive harmonization of the Member States' economic policies, the proper functioning of the common market and the establishment of economic and monetary union ; whereas the Treaty made no provision for the powers essential to the establishment of the Fund;
Whereas it is appropriate to specify that the general provisions of the Treaties concerning the European Communities as regards privileges and immunities, non-contractual liability and the obligation of professional secrecy are applicable to the Fund;","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 907/73 of the Council of 3 April 1973 establishing a European Monetary Cooperation Fund', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nA European Monetary Cooperation Fund, hereinafter referred to as ""the Fund"", is hereby established ; it shall have legal personality.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWithin the limits of its powers the Fund shall promote:    - the proper functioning of the progressive narrowing of the margins of fluctuation of the Community currencies against each other;\n\n- interventions in Community currencies on the exchange markets;\n\n- settlements between Central Banks leading to a concerted policy on reserves.

Whereas Article 3 of Directive 79/112/EEC made it mandatory, in the labelling of beverages containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol, to indicate the actual alcoholic strength by volume;
Whereas rules concerning the manner of such indication must be laid down;
Whereas, in the case of products classified under headings No 22.04 and 22.05 of the Common Customs Tariffs, such rules are laid down in the specific Community provisions applicable to them;
Whereas this Directive applies to all other beverages containing more than 1,2 % by volume of alcohol;

Whereas this Directive may therefore be confined to introducing the provisions that must supplement such rules;

After consulting the Member States concerned in accordance with Article 105(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009,
Whereas:
(1) Fishing quotas for the year 2010 have been established by:

(2) Fishing quotas for the year 2011 have been established by:
— Council Regulation (EU) No 1124/2010 of 29 November 2010 fixing for 2011 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea (6),

(3) According to paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, when the Commission has established that a Member State has exceeded the fishing quotas which have been allocated to it, it shall operate deductions from future fishing quotas of that Member State by applying certain multiplying factors as set out therein.
(4) Paragraph 5 of Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 provides that, if a deduction cannot be operated pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2 of that Article on the quota of the stock that was overfished because that quota is not sufficiently available to the Member State concerned, the Commission, after consultation of the Member State concerned, may deduct in the following year or years quotas for other stocks or groups of stocks available to that Member State in the same geographical area, or with the same commercial value.
(5) Certain Member States have no quota available in 2011 for some stocks which they overfished in 2010. In such cases, it is appropriate to operate such deductions on quotas available to those Member States for other stocks in the same geographical area, taking into account the need to avoid discards in mixed fisheries.
(6) Concerned Member States have been consulted with regard to proposed deductions and suggested certain changes which should be taken into account by the Commission to the extent justified.

Having regard to Council Regulation (Euratom) No 2587/1999 of 2 December 1999 defining the investment projects to be communicated to the Commission in accordance with Article 41 of the Treaty(1),
Whereas:
(1) In order to increase transparency and legal certainty, it is necessary to strengthen existing rules and formalise practices applied by the Commission to conduct the discussions and examine the investment projects which relate to the objectives of the Euratom Treaty.
(2) The communication to the Commission of investment projects relating to new installations and also to replacements or conversions which fulfil the criteria laid down by the Council in Regulation (Euratom) No 2587/1999 should be made by means of a form, which can be sent in a paper version or an electronic version. In the interests of legal certainty, it is necessary to confirm to the persons or undertakings having submitted a communication that the Commission has received it.
(3) The period within which the Commission is required to examine, discuss and adopt its views pursuant to Article 43 of the Euratom Treaty should be set at two months from receipt of a complete communication. The remarks made by third parties should be transmitted by the Commission to the persons or undertakings concerned for possible reaction from them. In the interests of legal certainty, the examination and discussion should be brought to an end by a recommendation as provided for under Article 124 of the Euratom Treaty.
(4) In all cases where, as a result of a preliminary examination, the Commission finds that doubts exist as to the objectives of the Euratom Treaty in the light of Regulation (Euratom) No 2587/1999, a detailed examination and discussion procedure should be opened in order to enable the Commission to gather all the information it needs to comply with its tasks under the Euratom Treaty and to allow the persons and undertakings concerned to submit their comments.
(5) After having considered the comments submitted by the persons or undertakings concerned, the Commission should conclude its examination by adopting a recommendation as soon as doubts have been removed.
(6) In the interest of achieving a coordinated development of investment in the nuclear field, it is appropriate to monitor effectively the measures finally taken by persons or undertakings concerned pursuant to the recommendation adopted by the Commission.
(7) In order to ensure that the provisions of the Euratom Treaty are applied correctly and effectively, the Commission should be able to revoke its recommendation if it was based on incorrect information.
(8) It is appropriate to inform the public about investment projects whilst, at the same time, observing the principle laid down in Article 44 of the Euratom Treaty that the consent of Member States, persons and undertakings concerned is necessary. In the interests of transparency and of legal certainty, it is appropriate to publish all investment projects and recommendations adopted. The Commission should also publish an annual report recording implementation of the recommendations made as well as specific measures taken by the persons or undertakings concerned in response to the views of the Commission.
(9) Should the investments not be necessary for or go beyond the objectives of the Euratom Treaty or should their public financing distort or threaten to distort competition in the internal market, this Regulation is without prejudice to the application of the EC Treaty.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1 (1) thereof,
Whereas Schedule CXL requires to open an annual import quota of 53 000 tonnes of frozen beef falling within CN code 0202 and products falling within CN code 0206 29 91; whereas the rules of application for the quota year 1997/98 starting 1 July 1997 must be established;
Whereas a method of administration should be applied which is similar to the one used in the past for corresponding quotas; whereas those arrangements consist of the allocation by the Commission of the quantities available partly to traditional operators and partly to operators engaging in trade in beef and veal;
Whereas the traditional importers should be allocated 80 % of the quota i.e. 42 400 tonnes on application and in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota during the most recent reference period; whereas steps should be taken to ensure that operators of the new Member States can participate on equal terms in the allocations of the quantities available;
Whereas, on the basis of the submission of applications from interested parties and subject to their acceptance by the Commission operators who can demonstrate the genuine nature of their business and who apply for quantities of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota i.e. 10 600 tonnes; whereas the genuine nature of their business should be demonstrated through the presentation of proofs of a certain size of trade in beef and veal with countries which were third countries on the day of import or export in question;
Whereas exports of beef from the United Kingdom have been seriously hit by the BSE-discussions, in particular since the end of March 1996; whereas in the establishment of performance criteria for the 10 600 tonnes account should be taken of the export situation in the United Kingdom;
Whereas verification of the abovementioned criteria requires that applications be submitted in the Member State in which the importer is entered into the value-added tax register;
Whereas operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 April 1997 should be barred access to the quota in order to prevent speculation;
Whereas subject to the provisions of this Regulation, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3719/88, laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 495/97 (3), and (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 266/97 (5), shall apply to import licences issued under this Regulation;
Whereas the effective management of this quota and in particular the prevention of fraud requires that the licences used are returned to the competent authorities in order that they may verify that the quantities shown therein are correct; whereas, to that end, an obligation should be imposed on the competent authorities to carry out such verification; whereas the amount of the security to be lodged on the issue of the licences should be fixed in such a way as to ensure that the licences are used and returned to the competent authorities;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas more than one million hectares in several regions of Portugal have been collectivized in the context of the 'Reform Agraria'; whereas much of this land has been or is being redistributed to the former owners of their successors; whereas part of  this land was dedicated to livestock production before collectivization; whereas, following collectivization, this land was largerly used for the cultivation of arable crops; whereas, if the viability of the holdings concerned is not to be endangered,  the conversion of the said land to traditional farming activities, namely extensive farming of cattle and/or sheep and goats, as recommended by Portugal in the regions concerned, requires the existence of a sufficient number of premium rights as  referred to in Article 4d of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (2) and Article 5a of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the  market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (3); whereas Portugal should be enabled to implement a programme for the conversion of this land by providing it with a specific national reserve of premium rights; whereas, so as not to disturb the situation on the  market in Portugal, the maximum number of livestock units (LU) which may be the subject of the conversion programme must be restricted;
Whereas the land collectivization process, because of its nature and scale, has affected all farming activity, and therefore all farms, in the regions concerned; whereas all the agricultural areas in the collectivized regions should therefore be  eligible for the conversion programme;
Whereas access to the conversion programme should be restricted to producers with all or part of their plots in the regions affected by collectivization, provided they fulfil certain conditions and undertake to convert such plots to extensive livestock  farming with a maximum stocking density per converted hectare, in accordance with a conversion plan approved by the competent authorities;
Whereas male cattle born to new suckler cows installed under the conversion programme must also be eligible for the special premium provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68, without prejudice to current producers; whereas it is therefore  appropriate that part of the premium rights arising from the conversion of arable crops to the raising of suckler cows should be used to incerease the regional ceiling on premiums referred to in the abovementioned Regulation;

","Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002
of 13 June 2002
laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular point 3 of Article 63 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) The Treaty of Amsterdam aims to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice and confers a shared right of initiative on the Commission in order to take the relevant measures on a harmonised immigration policy.
(2) Paragraph 38(c)(ii) of the action plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice(3) provides for the preparation of rules concerning procedures for the issue by Member States of long-visas and residence permits.
(3) The Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 emphasised the need for this harmonised immigration policy, particularly in view of the provisions of the Treaty relating to the entry and residence of third-country nationals.
(4) Council Joint Action 97/11/JHA(4) concerning a uniform format for residence permits confirms the need to harmonise the format of residence permits issued by Member States to third-country nationals. Consequently, it is appropriate that Joint Action 97/11/JHA should henceforth be replaced by a Community act.
(5) It is essential that the uniform format for residence permits should contain all the necessary information and meet very high technical standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. This will contribute to the objective of preventing and combating illegal immigration and illegal residence. The format should also be suited to use by all the Member States and bear universally recognisable harmonised security features, which are visible to the naked eye.
(6) In order to improve protection of residence permits against counterfeiting and falsification, Member States and the Commission will consider at regular intervals, in line with technological developments, what changes should be made to the security features built into permits, especially incorporation and use of new biometric features.
(7) This Regulation only lays down such specifications as are not secret. These specifications need to be supplemented by specifications which are to remain secret in order to prevent the risk of counterfeiting and falsifications and which may not include personal data or references to such data. Powers to adopt such additional technical specifications should be conferred on the Commission, which will be assisted by the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas(5). In this respect, it should be ensured that any lack of continuity with regard to the residence permits arising from the Council Decisions of 17 December 1997 and 8 June 2001 is avoided.
(8) To ensure that the information in question is not divulged more widely than is necessary, it is also essential that each Member State designate a single body for printing the uniform format for residence permits, while retaining the possibility of changing that body, if necessary. For security reasons, each Member State should communicate the name of the competent body to the Commission and to the other Member States.
(9) Member States should, in consultation with the Commission, implement the necessary measures to ensure that the processing of personal data complies with the level of protection referred to in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(6).
(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).
(11) This Regulation does not affect the competence of Member States with regard to the recognition of States and territorial entities and passports, travel and identity documents issued by their authorities.
(12) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of the third part of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark will, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will transpose it into its national law.
(13) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis falling within the area referred to in Article 1, point B, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(8).
(14) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 3 July 2001, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(15) In accordance with Article 1 of the said Protocol, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation. Consequently and without prejudice to Article 4 of the aforementioned Protocol, the provisions of this Regulation do not apply to Ireland,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 of 13 June 2002 laying down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

It will be based on the specifications set out in the ICAO documents on machine-readable visas (document 9303, part 2) or on machine-readable travel documents (cards) (document 9303, part 3). It will contain the following entries:\n\n1. The title of the document (residence permit) will appear in the language(s) of the issuing Member State(1).\n\n2. The document number (with special security features and preceded by an identification letter).\n\n3.1. Name: surname and forename(s) in that order(2).\n\n4.2. ""Valid until"" will indicate the relevant expiry date or, where appropriate, a word to indicate unlimited validity.\n\n5.3. Place of issue and date of beginning of validity: the place and date of issue of the residence permit(3).\n\n6.4. Type of permit: the specific type of residence permit issued by the Member State to the third-country national(4). The residence permit of a member of the family of a citizen of the European Union who has not exercised the right of free movement must contain the entry ""family member"".\n\n7.5.-9. Remarks: Member States may enter details and indications for national use necessary in the light of their national provisions on third-country nationals, including indications relating to any permission to work(5).\n\n8. Date/signature/authorisation: where appropriate, the signature and seal of the issuing authority and/or the signature of the holder.\n\n9. The printed area will contain the national emblem of the Member State to distinguish the residence permit and provide a safeguard of its national origin.\n\n10. Machine-readable area. Machine-readable area will conform to ICAO guidelines.\n\n11. The machine-readable area will contain a printed text indicating exclusively the Member State concerned. This text may not affect the technical features of the machine-readable area.\n\n12. Metallised latent image effect, including the country code of the Member State, if a sticker is used.\n\n13. OVD (optically variable device) (kinegram or equivalent sign) which provides a quality of identification and a level of security not less than the device used in the current uniform format for visas.\n\n14. If the residence permit is produced as a stand-alone document, an identity photograph will be affixed in this space and secured by being integrated in the structure of the card or by means of a hot-seal laminate, the optically variable device being incorporated in each case.\n\nIf the residence permit is produced as a sticker, this space will contain a photograph produced according to high security standards.\n\n15. The following additional information boxes will be provided on the back in the case of a stand-alone document:\n\n- date and place of birth(6),\n\n- nationality(7),\n\n- sex(8),\n\n- remarks(9).\n\nThe address of the permit holder may also be indicated(10).\n\n(b) Colour, printing process\n\nThe Member States will establish the colour and the printing process in accordance with the uniform format set out in this Annex and the technical specifications to be established in accordance with Article 2 of this Regulation.\n\n(c) Material\n\nThe paper used for the residence permit giving biographical or other data must meet the following minimum requirements:\n\n- no optical brighteners,\n\n- duo-tone watermarks,\n\n- security reagents to guard against attempts at tampering by chemical erasure,\n\n- coloured fibres (partly visible, partly fluorescent under UV light),\n\n- UV-fluorescent planchettes.\n\nNo watermarks are used if the residence permit is issued in the form of a sticker.\n\nIf a card for biographical data is made entirely of plastic, it is not usually possible to incorporate the authentication marks used in paper. The lack of such marks must therefore be compensated for by the use of security printing techniques, OVDs, or issuing techniques which go beyond the following enhanced security standards. The basic security features of the materials used should be of a uniform design.\n\n(d) Printing techniques\n\nThe following printing techniques will be employed:\n\n- Background printing:\n\ntwo-tone guilloches,\n\nfluorescent rainbow colouring,\n\nUV-fluorescent overprinting,\n\neffective anti-counterfeiting and falsification motifs,\n\nreagent inks must be used on paper cards and stickers.\n\nThe lay-out of the front of a card will be distinguishable from the back of the card.\n\n- Form printing:\n\nwith integrated micro printing (unless already included in background printing).\n\n- Numbering:\n\nprinted (where possible with a special style of figures or typeface and in UV-fluorescent ink) or, in the case of cards, integrated, using the same technique as for the biographical data. For stickers, printed numbering using fluorescent ink and a special style of figures is obligatory.\n\nIf stickers are used, intaglio printing with latent image effect, micro text and optically variable ink will also be employed. Additional optically variable security devices will also be used on cards made entirely of plastic, at least through the use of optically variable ink or equivalent measures. The basic features of the security printing should be of a uniform design.\n\n(e) Protection against copying\n\nAn OVD providing a quality of identification and a level of security not less than the device used in the current uniform format for visas will be used on the residence permit sticker or on the front of the residence permit card. This OVD will be incorporated into the structure of the card, into the hot-sealed laminate or as an OVD overlay, or, on stickers, as metallised OVD (with intaglio overprinting).\n\n(f) Issuing technique\n\nTo ensure that residence permit data are properly secured against attempts at counterfeiting and falsification, biographical data including the photograph, the holder\'s signature and the other main data will in future be integrated into the basic material of the document. Conventional methods of attaching the photograph will no longer be used.\n\nThe following issuing techniques may be used:\n\n- laser printing,\n\n- thermo-transfer,\n\n- ink-jet printing,\n\n- photographic,\n\n- laser engraving.\n\nTo ensure that biographical issue data are adequately protected against attempts at tampering, hot-seal lamination with OVD security laminate will be compulsory where laser printing, thermo-transfer or photographic techniques are used.

Whereas:
(1) Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 provides for the migration of the Member States participating in SIS 1+ from N.SIS to N.SIS II using the interim migration architecture, with the support of France and of the Commission, by 30 September 2009 at the latest. If necessary, this date may be changed in accordance with the procedure defined in Article 17(2) of that Regulation.
(2) Issues identified during testing of SIS II led to delay in the implementation of the activities set out in Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008. Council conclusions of 26 and 27 February 2009 stated that, given the time required to resolve outstanding issues, the date for migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II, set for September 2009, was no longer realistic.
(3) In the light of the delay to the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II, the new date for the completion of migration should be set to coincide with the final expiry date of Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008, allowing the continuation of activities leading to the start of operations of SIS II until that date.
(4) In accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the EC Treaty, Denmark did not take part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 and is not bound by it nor subject to its application. However, given that Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol, notified the transposition of this acquis in its national law. It is therefore bound under international law to implement this Decision.
(5) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (2). The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application. This Decision should therefore not be addressed to the United Kingdom.

 (3). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application. This Decision should therefore not be addressed to Ireland.

 (4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (5) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(8) As regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (6) on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement.

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides for a complete revision of Community rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption, including the introduction of a number of strict requirements. In addition, it provides that appropriate transitional measures may be adopted.
(2) In view of the strict nature of those requirements, it is necessary to provide for transitional measures for the Member States in order to allow industry sufficient time to adjust. In addition, alternative collection, transport, storage, handling, processing and uses for animal by-products need to be further developed as well as disposal methods for those by-products.
(3) Accordingly, as a temporary measure a derogation should be granted to enable the Member States to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules for the processing standards for Category 3 materials and manure used in biogas plants.
(4) In order to prevent a risk to animal and public health appropriate control systems should be maintained in the Member States for the period of the transitional measures.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic anti-dumping Regulation’), and in particular Articles 11(4), 13(4) and 14(5) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 91/2009 (2), imposed anti-dumping measures on certain iron or steel fasteners originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the original measures’). By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 723/2011 (3), the Council extended these measures to certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia (‘the extended measures’) with the exception of imports produced by certain companies specifically mentioned.
B.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(2) The European Commission (‘the Commission’) has received a request for an exemption pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation from the anti-dumping measures extended to imports of certain iron or steel fasteners consigned from Malaysia. The application was lodged by Andfast Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (‘the applicant’), a producer in Malaysia (‘the country concerned’).
C.   PRODUCT
(3) The product under examination is certain iron or steel fasteners, other than of stainless steel, i.e. wood screws (excluding coach screws), self-tapping screws, other screws and bolts with heads (whether or not with their nuts or washers, but excluding screws turned from bars, rods, profiles or wire, of solid section, of a shank thickness not exceeding 6 mm and excluding screws and bolts for fixing railway track construction material), and washers, consigned from Malaysia, currently falling within CN codes ex 7318 12 90, ex 7318 14 91, ex 7318 14 99, ex 7318 15 59, ex 7318 15 69, ex 7318 15 81, ex 7318 15 89, ex 7318 15 90, ex 7318 21 00 and ex 7318 22 00 (‘product concerned’).
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures, i.e. 1 January 2008 to 30 September 2010.
(5) Furthermore, the applicant alleges that it is not related to exporting producers subject to measures, and that it has not circumvented the measures applicable to certain iron or steel fasteners of Chinese origin.
(6) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Union after the end of the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures.
E.   PROCEDURE
(7) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(8) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting the applicant an exemption from the extended measures.
(a)   Questionnaires
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
F.   REPEAL OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the European Union by the applicant.
(10) At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the examination result in a finding of circumvention in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this examination. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(11) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(12) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(13) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(14) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (4).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 7/2000(2), and in particular Article 5 in conjunction with Article 25(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The quantitative restrictions applicable to textile and clothing imports originating in North Korea are listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 517/94.
(2) The Commission has been requested by certain economic operators to increase the volumes of certain quantitative restrictions for imports of textile products originating in North Korea in order to satisfy certain market requirements.
(3) It is necessary to strike a certain balance between providing the requistie protection for the relevant sector of the Community industry concerned and maintaining an acceptable level of trade with North Korea, bearing in mind the various interests of the parties concerned.
(4) An analysis of the situation in the Community industry concerned shows that the increase of the level of certain quotas for North Korea will not prejudice the abovementioned objective.
(5) The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to adapt accordingly the level of some of the quantitative restrictions applied in respect of North Korea, taking also into account the request received from the economic operators.

amending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include dazomet as an active substance in Annex I thereto
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes dazomet.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, dazomet has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) Belgium was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission by 16 April 2007 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 11 March 2010, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing dazomet may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include dazomet in Annex I to that Directive.
(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at EU level. The EU level risk assessment addresses only professional use outdoors for the remedial treatment of wooden poles, such as transmission poles, by insertion of granules. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the EU level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(7) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing dazomet and used as wood preservatives to ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC and Annex VI thereto.
(8) In particular, it is appropriate to require that products intended for industrial or professional use be used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated that risks for industrial or professional users can be reduced by other means.
(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance dazomet and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '11.8.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 210/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2010/50/EU\nof 10 August 2010\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include dazomet as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

Whereas aid can be granted only for seed for sowing; whereas, if there are other possible uses for the seed and a risk that the aid will be improperly granted on a proportion of production, provision should be made for recipients of the aid to provide evidence that the seed covered by their aid applications was correctly used; whereas, in view of the splintering of seed marketing, it may be difficult to provide evidence for all seed marketed and the requirements relating to evidence should be relaxed;
Whereas Community rice seed production has risen substantially over the last three marketing years; whereas there thus appears to be a risk that a proportion of this seed could be used for purposes other than sowing; whereas control measures for the use of such seed should therefore be introduced; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1686/72 should therefore be amended accordingly;

When the catheter is on the right place in the coronary artery, the balloon is inflated so that the fatty deposits (atherosclerotic plaque) are pressed against the wall of the vein. By compressing the plaque, the inside diameter of the vein increases.\nThe marker bands make it possible to locate the exact position of the atraumatic tip in the body.\nThe balloon catheter is removed from the body and discarded after treatment.\nThe article is presented in packaging and is sterilised.\n(\n*1\n)\nSee image 1\n9018\xa039\xa000\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and\xa06 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, and by the wording of CN codes 9018  and 9018\xa039\xa000 .\nDue to its objective characteristics, namely the combination of the balloon, the atraumatic tip, the golden marker bands and the Luer connection, the tube can, upon presentation, be identified as an instrument or appliance of Chapter 90, used in medical sciences.\nClassification under heading 9021  is excluded as the tube is not implanted in the body to compensate for a defect or disability but it is removed after treatment.\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 9018\xa039\xa000  as catheters (see also the Harmonized System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 9018 , Group (I)).\n2.\nA plastic curved tube (so-called ‘guide catheter’) with an inner diameter ranging from 1,47\xa0mm to 2,29\xa0mm and a length of 100 cm with a radiopaque marker and an atraumatic (flexible) tip.\nThe article comprises a double interlock knit flat section of stainless steel, encapsulated in plastic material (PEBA, polyphthalamide (PPA), Nylon) and it has a lubricant coating applied to the silicon inner surface of the guide catheter.\nThe guide catheter enables access to the coronary artery through a vein. Other appliances can be directed by this guide catheter to the artery.\nThe radiopaque marker makes it possible to locate the exact position of the atraumatic tip in the body.\nThe guide catheter is removed from the body and discarded after treatment.\nThe article is presented in packaging and is sterilised.\n(\n*1\n)\nSee image 2\n9018\xa039\xa000\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and\xa06 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, and by the wording of CN codes 9018  and 9018\xa039\xa000 .\nDue to its objective characteristics, namely the combination of the curve, the radiopaque marker, the atraumatic tip and the lubricant coating, the tube can, upon presentation, be identified as an instrument or appliance of Chapter 90, used in medical sciences.\nClassification under heading 9021  is excluded as the tube is not implanted in the body to compensate for a defect or disability but it is removed after treatment.\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 9018\xa039\xa000  as catheters (see also the HSEN to heading 9018 , Group (I)).\n3.\nA flexible metal wire (so-called ‘guide wire’) with a diameter of 0,35\xa0mm, a length ranging from 180-300 cm, two radiopaque markers and a rounded tip.\nThe wire is made of a metal alloy for biomedical use, with a proximal coating of PTFE and a distal coating of silicone or hydrophilic material.\nThe radiopaque markers make it possible to locate the exact position of the wire in the body.\nThe wire is used for guiding and positioning devices for interventions in the coronary artery.\nThe guide wire is removed from the body and discarded after treatment.\nThe article is presented in packaging and is sterilised.\n(\n*1\n)\nSee image 3\n9018\xa039\xa000\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and\xa06 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, and by the wording of CN codes 9018  and 9018\xa039\xa000 .\nDue to its objective characteristics, namely the combination of the design and the radiopaque markers, the wire can, upon presentation, be identified as an instrument or appliance of Chapter\xa090, used in medical sciences.\nClassification under heading 9021  is excluded as the wire is not implanted in the body to compensate for a defect or disability but it is removed after treatment.\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 9018\xa039\xa000  as wire guides (see also the HSEN to heading 9018  Group (I)).\n4.\nA hand-operated inflation device made of high-strength polycarbonate, equipped with a manometer and a volume scale. It has a high pressure hose connection (Luer-type) and can inflate, with precise pressure adjustments, up to 20 atmospheres (atm).\nThe device is to be used in a medical environment for the inflation and deflation of balloon catheters.\nThe manometer is used for monitoring the pressure inside the balloon catheter when inflating or deflating and during surgery.\nThe volume scale indicates the amount of liquid (maximum 20 ml) that is, by means of pressure, inserted into the catheter and also the amount of liquid that flows back freely as the balloon deflates.\nThe Luer connection makes it possible to connect the inflation device to the balloon catheter.\nThe device is for single patient use only and is discarded after treatment.\nThe article is presented in packaging and is sterilised.\n(\n*1\n)\nSee image 4\n9018\xa090\xa084\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and\xa06 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature and by the wording of CN codes 9018 , 9018\xa090  and 9018\xa090\xa084 .\nAs a small amount of liquid is inserted into the catheter by means of pressure, but then flows back freely, the device does not raise or otherwise continuously displace volumes of liquids (see the HSEN to heading 8413 , first paragraph). Consequently, classification under heading 8413  as pumps for liquids is excluded.\nDue to its objective characteristics, namely the combination of the design, the precise pressure adjustments, the small amount of liquid used and the Luer-type connection, the article can, upon presentation, be identified as an instrument or appliance of Chapter 90, used in medical sciences (see also the HSEN to heading 9018 , fifth paragraph).\nClassification under heading 9021  is excluded as the article is not worn, carried or implanted in the body to compensate for a defect or disability.\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 9018\xa090\xa084  as other instruments and appliances used in medical, surgical, dental or veterinary sciences.\nImage 1\nImage 2\nImage 3\nImage 4\n(\n*1\n)\nThe images are purely for information.'}]}"

(2) The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas through the establishment of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the adoption by the latter of conservation and management measures which become binding on the contracting parties.

That resolution established procedures for the identification of countries whose vessels had fished for tuna and tuna-like species in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. It also specified measures to be taken, including if necessary non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures, in order to prevent those countries’ vessels from continuing such fishing practices.
(4) Since the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT has identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels.
(5) ICCAT has also identified Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic blue-fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures.
(6) ICCAT has furthermore identified Sierra Leone as country whose vessels fish Atlantic swordfish (Xiphias gladius) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures.
(7) Imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 (2).
(8) Imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna originating in Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 826/2004 (3).
(9) Imports of Atlantic swordfish originating in Sierra Leone are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 828/2004 (4).
(10) At its 14th Special Meeting in 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations for the lifting of trade-restrictive measures against those three countries.
(11) Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes pyriproxyfen.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, pyriproxyfen has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) The Netherlands were designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 2 October 2009 in accordance with Article 10(5) and (7) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 21 September 2012, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods and containing pyriproxyfen may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include pyriproxyfen for use in product type 18 in Annex I to that Directive.
(6) Not all potential uses and exposure scenarios have been evaluated at Union level, which, in particular, included only professional use. It is therefore appropriate to require that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(7) In the light of the findings in the assessment report that there is a possible indirect human exposure via consumption of food as a result of those uses represented in the assessment, it is appropriate to require, where relevant, verification of the need to set new or to amend existing maximum residue levels in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) or with Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (4). Measures should be adopted ensuring that the applicable maximum residue levels are not exceeded.
(8) In view of the assumptions made during the risk assessment, it is appropriate to require that products authorised for professionals are used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to workers and operators can be reduced to an acceptable level.
(9) In view of the risks identified for the environment, it is appropriate to require that products are not authorised for direct use on surface water, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and groundwater can be reduced to an acceptable level, and that any authorisation of products intended to be used in waste treatment facilities is subject to appropriate risk mitigation measures to avoid contamination of the area outside the waste treatment site.
(10) The provisions of this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products of product-type 18 containing the active substance pyriproxyfen and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(12) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(13) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (5), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.

It is therefore appropriate to require that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n\n((7)) In the light of the findings in the assessment report that there is a possible indirect human exposure via consumption of food as a result of those uses represented in the assessment, it is appropriate to require, where relevant, verification of the need to set new or to amend existing maximum residue levels in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)or with Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC(4). Measures should be adopted ensuring that the applicable maximum residue levels are not exceeded.\n\n((8)) In view of the assumptions made during the risk assessment, it is appropriate to require that products authorised for professionals are used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to workers and operators can be reduced to an acceptable level.\n\n((9)) In view of the risks identified for the environment, it is appropriate to require that products are not authorised for direct use on surface water, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and groundwater can be reduced to an acceptable level, and that any authorisation of products intended to be used in waste treatment facilities is subject to appropriate risk mitigation measures to avoid contamination of the area outside the waste treatment site.\n\n((10)) The provisions of this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products of product-type 18 containing the active substance pyriproxyfen and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n\n((11)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n\n((12)) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((13)) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((14)) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents(5), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.\n\n((15)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 January 2014 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 February 2015.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 and following of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Walloon Government submitted to the Commission on 11 July 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the areas of the province of Liège eligible under Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and the areas of that province qualifying for transitional support under Objective 2 pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The draft contains the information listed in Article 16 of the Regulation, and in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF).
(5) Under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the operations being financed by the Structural Funds must comply, inter alia, with the Community policies and actions, including those concerning the protection and improvement of the environment. The Kingdom of Belgium has not complied with its obligations under Article 4 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora(2)as regards proposing a list of sites indicating which natural habitat types in Annex I and which species in Annex II that are native to its territory the sites host in order to set up a coherent European ecological network of special areas of conservation, known as ""Natura 2000"". It was reminded of this obligation on 23 June 1999 by a letter from Mrs Wulf-Mathies and Ms Bjerregaard and on 28 March 2000 by a letter from Mr Barnier. As a result, payments for ERDF assistance under the measures ""Specialised economic platforms"" and ""Valorisation of touristic and cultural potential and of the natural heritage"" concerning this SPD, which are likely to be harmful to any sites to be protected, should be suspended until the list of ""Natura 2000"" sites has been notified to the Commission.
(6) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of the Regulation, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(7) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(8) The Commission has satisfied itself that the single programming document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(9) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(10) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(11) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this single programming document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/330/EC: Commission Decision of 11 December 2001 approving the single programming document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the province of Liège in Belgium (notified under document number C(2001) 3583)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the areas of the province of Liège eligible under Objective 2 and the areas of that province qualifying for transitional support under Objective 2 in Belgium for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 11 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In June 1983, the Commission received a complaint lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers Federations (CEFIC) on behalf of producers representing all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of artificial corundum, into the Community, falling within Common Customs Tariff subheading 28.20 B, corresponding to NIMEXE code 28.20-30, originating in the People's Republic of China, Czechoslovakia, Spain and Yugoslavia and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing. The majority of the known exporters, all known importers and all producers made their views known in writing.
(3) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purpose of a determination regarding dumping and injury and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
(a) EEC producers
- SOFREM SA, Paris, France,
- Samim Abrasivi SpA, Milan, Italy,
- Dynamit Nobel AG, Troisdorf, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Lonza-Werke GmbH, Waldshut - Tiengen, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Herman C. Starck Berlin GmbH, Duesseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Universal Abrasives Ltd, Stafford, United Kingdom;
(b) Exporter
Tovarna Dusika Ruse n.sol.o., Ruse, Yugoslavia;
(c) Importers
- Continentale Erzgesellschaft mbH, Duesseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Alfred Hempel GmbH & Co., Duesseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Kerimpex Handelsgesellschaft mbH, Selb/Bayern, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Mineralienwerke GmbH, Duisburg, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Smyris Srl, Milan, Italy,
- Veneta Mineraria, Milan, Italy.
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from the majority of exporters, all known importers and all complainant Community producers and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
Two of the three Spanish producers named in the complaint stated that their exports to the Community were insignificant during the reference period, and did not furnish any details concerning their domestic sales or their exports. They did, however, provide information about the cessation of activities, at the end of 1982, of the remaining Spanish producer named, which had apparently been responsible for the major part of exports to the Community.
The Commission did not receive any information concerning the Chinese exports to the Community from the Chinese exporter named in the complaint.
In the case of the People's Republic of China and Spain, therefore, the investigation was based on information given by the importers in Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany as regards export prices and quantities.
(4) The investigation of dumping covered the period October 1982 to September 1983.
B. Normal value
(5) In order to establish whether the imports from the People's Republic of China and Czechoslovakia were dumped, the Commission had to take account of the fact that these countries do not have market economies and the Commission therefore had to base its determinations on the normal value in a market-economy country.
(6) The complaint alleged dumping on the basis of a comparison of export prices of the Chinese and Czech producers with the Spanish current domestic ex-works price; as to Yugoslavia, the comparison was based on the domestic ex-works price and the export price to the Community.
(7) As the Spanish producers did not supply detailed information, it was decided to establish normal value on the basis of domestic prices on the Yugoslav market, which offers close comparability in terms of the basic technical characteristics of the products supplied with those of the other allegedly dumped imports. None of the exporters or importers objected to this choice but producers suggested, at a relatively late stage of the investigation, that Austrian domestic prices should be taken into consideration. This would, however, have resulted in the need to make considerable adjustments for quality. The Commission, at least at the present stage of the proceeding, decided to maintain its preference for Yugoslav domestic prices.
(8) As Spanish producers did not supply any information on their domestic prices, the Commission services used Yugoslav domestic prices as the best information available. These data were considered to be more reliable than the information given in the complaint.
(9) The producer of artificial corundum in Yugoslavia, classified as a market economy, was found to operate normal profitability criteria, although margins on exports were much higher in general than those on domestic sales. Of the three basic grades of corundum taken into consideration for the purposes of the procedure, only the white variety was found to be sold at a loss on the domestic Yugoslav market. In this case normal value was constructed by adding a standard domestic market profit margin to the full costs of the product. Domestic prices were taken as the basis of normal value for the other two grades of artificial corundum.
C. Export prices
(10) In one case, where the importer in the Community was not independent of the exporter, the export price was reconstructed on the basis of the first sales within the Community to independent purchasers, making due allowance for verified operating expenses and for a 5 % profit margin, considered to be reasonable in the light of independent importers' profit experience.
(11) In all other cases, the starting point for calculations was the exporter's invoiced price to an independent importer within the Community, appropriate allowances being taken into account to permit a proper comparison of these export prices with normal values for the purposes of establishing dumping margins.
D. Comparison
(12) Normal values were compared with export prices at the ex-works level, adjustments being made for transport, credit terms, ancillary costs and agents' commission, where applicable. Also, where applicable, allowances were made for any transformation of the product, after its importation into the Community, required to bring it up to a comparable condition with other imported products from the point of view of specification or quality.
(13) The calculations were made on a monthly basis. The results obtained were then weighted by the tonnages imported during the reference period in order to obtain a weighted average margin.
E. Margins
(14) The above examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping by the Chinese and Czech exporters, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. (15) These margins vary according to the importing Member State and the variety of artificial corundum concerned. The weighted average margins are:
1.2.3 //   // Brown corundum  // White corundum  // - for the People's Republic of China  // 8,3 %  // 6,2 %  // - for Czechoslovakia  // 7,9 %  // 8,9 %
For imports originating in Spain and Yugoslavia no dumping was found. Consequently, the proceeding in respect of these imports should be terminated.
F. Injury
(16) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China of artificial corundum increased from 3 955 tonnes in 1980 to 6 296 tonnes in 1983, i.e. an increase of 59,2 %, with a consequent increase in the market share held by these exporting countries from 2,1 to 3,9 %. The market share of Community producers decreased from 76,2 to 71,6 % for the same period and the Community industry's total production fell from 193 081 tonnes in 1979 to 109 275 tonnes in the first nine months of 1983, i.e. a decrease of approximately 24,5 %, after adjusting the 1983 tonnage on a yearly basis, with a fall in the average utilization of Community production capacity from 90,6 to 70,4 %. At the same time, consumption in the Community of artificial corundum decreased by 18,7 % between 1980 and 1983.
(17) The weighted average resale ex-works prices of imports from Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of China undercut the prices of the Community producers during 1983 by margins varying from 9,5 to 30 %. The resale prices of these imports were in most cases lower than the variable production costs of the Community industry and in all cases lower than the total production costs.
(18) The consequent impact on this Community industry has apparently been a 17,1 % reduction in employment between 1980 and 1983. The dumped imports caused Community producers to sell at prices which did not permit them to earn reasonable profits or even to cover more than 73 % of their costs in 1983.
G. Community interest
(19) The Community association of manufacturers of refractory equipment has argued that the introduction of protective measures would not be in the Community interest because it would affect their competitive position and cause problems for employment in their industry, which employs a greater number of workers than the artificial corundum manufacturers' industry.
(20) However, in view of the difficulties facing the Community corundum industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken and a provisional duty be imposed in order to prevent injury being caused during the remaining investigation period.
H. Rate of duty
(21) Having compared the Community producers' weighted average prices and costs, taking account of their profit situation, the Commission has concluded that provisional anti-dumping duties should be imposed in the amount of the dumping margins found.
(22) A period should be fixed within which the parties concerned may make their views known in writing and request a hearing,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2690/84 of 21 September 1984 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of artificial corundum originating in the People' s Republic of China and Czechoslovakia and terminating the proceeding in respect of imports of artificial corundum originating in Spain and Yugoslavia"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular Article 15(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to the animal health requirements laid down in the specific acts of the Union referred to in Annex F thereto.
(2) Varroasis in bees is listed in Annex B to Directive 92/65/EEC. It is caused by ectoparasitic mites of the genus Varroa and has been reported worldwide.
(3) Article 15 of Directive 92/65/EEC provides that, where a Member State considers that its territory or part of its territory is free from one of the diseases listed in in Annex B thereto, it is to submit to the Commission appropriate documentation, on the basis of which a Decision is to be adopted.
(4) Varroasis spreads through movement of bee brood and direct contact between infested adult bees. The latter is only possible within the bee’s fly range. Consequently, only territories where the movement of bee hives and brood can be controlled and which are geographically isolated enough to prevent the migration of bees from the outside can be recognised as disease-free. Moreover, the competent authorities must prove through extended surveillance results that the region is indeed free from varroosis and that, to maintain the status, the introduction of live bees and brood is strictly controlled.
(5) Finland has asked the Commission to recognise the Åland Islands as a part of its territory that is free from varroosis. Article 355(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the provisions of the Treaties are to apply to the Åland Islands in accordance with the provisions set out in Protocol 2 to the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden.
(6) The Åland Islands are a group of islands situated between the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea and they are therefore geographically sufficiently separated from potentially varroosis-infected areas.
(7) Varroosis is a notifiable disease in the Åland Islands and no capped brood and hatched, adult live honey bees can be moved from mainland Finland to the Åland Islands. Finland has for several years observed the island’s bee population. On the basis of that surveillance Finland can now confirm the absence of the disease on the Åland Islands. As a result, that part of the Finnish territory can be considered free from that disease.
(8) The additional guarantees required in trade should therefore be defined, taking into account the measures already put in place by Finland in its national legislation.
(9) To establish the preconditions for the model health certificates for intra-Union movements of live bees between territories of the Union free of Varroa, an additional certification should be established in the health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC. Moreover, the local veterinary unit of the varroosis-free area or areas should be identified with a TRACES Code in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/821/EC (2).
(10) The introduction of live bees into the Union is only authorised under the conditions provided for in Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (3). In addition to the requirements laid down in that Regulation, in order to protect the varroosis-free status of the territories recognised as such, it is appropriate to prohibit the introduction of consignments of queen bees and their accompanying attendants into the Union, where the declared final destination of the consignments is a varroosis-free territory.

Whereas the Member States already compile statistical data, at annual or multiannual intervals, on goods traffic within their own territory;

Whereas the system set out in Directive 69/467/EEC should therefore be revised;
Whereas provision should be made for such amendment of this Directive as may prove necessary in the light of experience acquired over a suitable period, particularly as regards the compilation of data on the main flows of goods between the regions of the Community in the form of international traffic and for any statistical returns still compiled at frontiers within the Community to cease,","{'title': 'Council Directive 78/546/EEC of 12 June 1978 on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods by road, as part of regional statistics', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Directive shall apply to carriage of goods by road by means of vehicles registered in a Member State:    (a) in the territory of that Member State (hereinafter referred to as ""national transport"");\n\n(b) between that Member State and another Member State or a non-Member State (hereinafter referred to as ""international transport"").'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organization of the market in bananas (1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 3518/93 (2), and in particular Articles 16 (3), 20 and 30 thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2444/94 (4), lays down the detailed rules for applying the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community;
Whereas on 10 September 1994 tropical storm Debbie caused severe damage to the banana plantations in the Community regions of Martinique and Guadeloupe and in the ACP States of Saint Lucia and Dominica; whereas the effects of these exceptional  circumstances on production in the regions affected will be felt until July 1995 and will greatly affect imports and supplies to the Community markets during the fourth quarter of 1994; whereas this is likely to cause an appreciable increase in market  prices in certain regions of the Community;
Whereas Article 16 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 stipulates that where necessary, in particular to take account of the effects of exceptional circumstances affecting production or import conditions, the forecast supply balance may be adjusted and,  in such a case, the tariff quota is adapted;
Whereas the adaptation of the tariff quota must permit adequate supplies to the Community market up to the end of 1994 and provide compensation to operators who include or directly represent banana producers who suffered damage and who, in addition, in  the absence of appropriate measures, risk losing their traditional outlets on the Community market on a long-term basis;
Whereas the measures to be taken should have a specific transitional nature, within the meaning of Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93; whereas, prior to the entry into force of the new common market organization on 1 July 1993, existing national  market organizations, in order to cope with urgent cases or exceptional circumstances such as tropical storm Debbie, included provisions ensuring supplies to the market from other suppliers while safeguarding the interests of operators who are victims  of such exceptional events;
Whereas also, under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community negotiated an agreement which provides for the implementation of a provision for the reallocation of supplies which is intended to overcome such exceptional  circumstances and which will safeguard the interests of operators in the supplier countries which have suffered such damage;
Whereas, in anticipation of the actual implementation of that agreement, the Community producer regions and the ACP States which suffer such exceptional circumstances should be able to benefit from comparable measures; whereas the measures should  include the granting of the right to import in compensation third-country bananas and non-traditional ACP bananas for the benefit of the operators who directly suffered damage as a result of the impossibility of supplying the Community market with  bananas originating in affected producer regions; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for the quantities marketed on the Community market pursuant to this measure to be taken into consideration, in due course, for determining the reference  quantities for the operators concerned for the tariff quotas for future years; whereas these measures should be to the benefit of the operators who have directly suffered actual damage, without the possibility of compensation, and as a function of the  extent of the damage;
Whereas the competent authorities in the Member States where the operators concerned are established are the only authorities capable of determining those who should benefit from the measure in view of their experience and their knowledge of the actual  characteristics of the trade in question and to assess the damage on the basis of the supporting documentation provided by the operators;
Whereas, in view of their objectives, the provisions of this Regulation must enter into force immediately;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), submitted following consultation with the Monetary Committee,

Whereas the European Council of 8 and 9 December 1989 referred to the need to grant Hungary, after agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), an adjustment loan of an amount of US $ 1 000 million; whereas this amount is the equivalent of ECU 870 million;
Whereas the people of Hungary have close historic relationships with the people of the Community, and whereas that country is undertaking fundamental political and economic reforms and has decided to adopt a market economy model;
Whereas the said reforms will strengthen mutual confidence and bring Hungary closer to the Community;
Whereas the granting of the medium-term loan is an appropriate measure to facilitate the adjustment of the Hungarian economy in order to reap the full benefits of an economy based on market principles; whereas the terms and conditions of the loan should emphasise necessary structural adjustment, with due regard for social stability, as well as being consistent with the terms and conditions put forward by the IMF, whereas an agreement with the IMF on a stabilisation programme is necessary and should be concluded quickly; whereas assurances should be secured that Hungary has negotiated satisfactory terms with its private creditors to ensure their continued participation;

","Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2004
of 19 February 2004
on procedures for amending the Sirene Manual
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 66 thereof,
Having regard to the initiative of the Hellenic Republic(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) The Schengen Information System, (hereinafter referred to as the ""SIS"") set up pursuant to the provisions of Title IV of the Convention of 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders (hereinafter referred to as the ""Schengen Convention"")(3), constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union.
(2) Pursuant to the provisions of Article 92 of the Schengen Convention, the national sections of the Member States cannot exchange SIS data directly between themselves; they may only exchange data via the technical support function in Strasbourg. However, it is appropriate for certain supplementary information required for implementing certain provisions of the Schengen Convention correctly to be exchanged bilaterally or multilaterally. Such supplementary information is needed in particular in relation to the action required pursuant to Articles 25, 39, 46, 95 to 100, 102(3), 104(3), 106, 107, 109 and 110 of the Schengen Convention. The exchange of this supplementary information is carried out by the Sirene offices of each Member State.
(3) The Sirene Manual is a set of instructions to operators in the Sirene offices of each of the Member States which describes in detail the rules and procedures governing the bilateral or multilateral exchange of such supplementary information.
(4) Uniformity of the Sirene Manual should be ensured. The Schengen technical acquis should be applicable here.
(5) Amendments to Part 1 of the Sirene Manual pursuant to this Regulation should be confined to reflecting the applicable version of the provisions of the Schengen Convention.
(6) It is necessary to establish a procedure for amending the Sirene Manual in accordance with the relevant provisions of the various Treaties.
(7) The legislative basis required for allowing future amendments to the Sirene Manual consists of two separate instruments: this Regulation based on Article 66 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Council Decision 2004/201/JHA of 19 February 2004 on procedures for amending the Sirene Manual(4) based on Articles 30(1)(a) and (b), 31(a) and (b) and 34(2)(c) of the Treaty on European Union. The reason for this is that, as set out in Article 92 of the Schengen Convention, the SIS is to enable the authorities designated by the Member States, by means of an automated search procedure, to have access to alerts on persons and property for the purposes of border checks and other police and customs checks carried out within the country in accordance with national law, as well as for the purposes of issuing visas, residence permits and the administration of legislation on aliens in the context of the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the movement of persons. The exchange of the supplementary information required for implementing the provisions of the Schengen Convention referred to in recital 2, carried out by the Sirene offices of each Member State, also serves these purposes, as well as assisting with police cooperation generally.
(8) The fact that the legislative basis required consists of two separate instruments does not affect the principle that the SIS itself constitutes, and should continue to constitute, one single, integrated, information system, and that the Sirene offices should continue to carry out their tasks in an integrated manner.
(9) An arrangement should be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Iceland and Norway(5), annexed to the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(6).
(10) This Regulation and the United Kingdom's and Ireland's participation in its adoption and application are without prejudice to the arrangements for the United Kingdom's and Ireland's partial participation in the Schengen acquis defined by the Council in Decisions 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(7) and Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(8) respectively.
(11) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(12) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the Act of Accession,
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 378/2004 of 19 February 2004 on procedures for amending the Sirene Manual', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Sirene Manual shall constitute a set of instructions to operators in the Sirene offices of each Member State which establishes the rules and procedures governing the bilateral or multilateral exchange of supplementary information which is required in order to implement correctly certain provisions of the Schengen Convention, as integrated into the framework of the European Union.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 9,853 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4146 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Government of the Netherlands has submitted to the Commission on 23 September 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Twente; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas certain measures planned under this single programming document include the part-financing of aid schemes which have not yet been approved by the Commission; whereas the financial commitments should be reduced by the amounts corresponding to the said measures until the aid schemes are approved by the Commission;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the authorities of the Netherlands has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/4 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of the Netherlands;

Liquid chromatographic column 125 mm x 4 mm, reversed-phase C18, 5 μm packing or equivalent\n\n4.3.2. Spectrofluorimeter with variable wavelength adjustment of excitation and emission wavelengths\n\n5. Procedure\n\n5.1. General\n\n5.1.1. Blank feed\n\nFor the performance of the recovery test (5.1.2) a blank feed should be analysed to check that neither lasalocid sodium nor interfering substances are present. The blank feed should be similar in type to that of the sample and lasalocid sodium or interfering substances should not be detected.\n\n5.1.2. Recovery test\n\nA recovery test should be carried out by analysing the blank feed which has been fortified by addition of a quantity of lasalocid sodium, similar to that present in the sample. To fortify at a level of 100 mg/kg, transfer 10,0 ml of the stock standard (3.10.1) to a 250 ml conical flask and evaporate the solution to approximately 0,5 ml. Add 50 g of the blank feed, mix thoroughly and leave for 10 minutes mixing again several times before proceeding with the extraction step (5.2).\n\nAlternatively, if a blank feed similar in type to that of the sample is not available (see 5.1.1), a recovery test can be performed by means of the standard addition method. In this case the sample to be analysed is fortified with a quantity of lasalocid sodium similar to that already present in the sample. This sample is analysed together with the unfortified sample and the recovery calculated by subtraction.\n\n5.2. Extraction\n\n5.2.1. Feedingstuffs\n\nWeigh to the nearest 0,01 g, from 5 g to 10 g of the sample into a 250 ml conical flask with stopper. Add 100,0 ml of acidified methanol (3.8) by pipette. Stopper loosely and swirl to disperse. Place the flask in an ultrasonic bath (4.1) at approximately 40° C for 20 minutes, then remove and cool to room temperature. Allow to stand for about 1 hour until the suspended matter has settled, then filter an aliquot portion through a 0,45 μm membrane filter (4.2) into a suitable vessel. Proceed to the HPLC determination (5.3).\n\n5.2.2. Premixtures\n\nWeigh to the nearest 0,001 g about 2 g of the unground premix into a 250 ml graduated flask. Add 100,0 ml of acidified methanol (3.8) and swirl to disperse. Place the flask and contents in an ultrasonic bath (4.1) at approximately 40° C for 20 minutes, then remove and cool to room temperature. Dilute to the mark with acidified methanol (3.8) and mix thoroughly. Allow to stand for one hour until the suspended matter has settled, then filter an aliquot portion through a 0,45 μm membrane filter (4.2). Dilute an appropriate volume of the clear filtrate with acidified methanol (3.8) to produce a final test solution containing about 4 μg/ml of lasalocid sodium. Proceed to the HPLC determination (5.3).\n\n5.3. HPLC Determination\n\n5.3.1. Parameters\n\nThe following conditions are offered for guidance; other conditions may be used, provided they yield equivalent results:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nCheck the stability of the chromatographic system, injecting the calibration solution (3.10.3) containing 4,0 μg/ml several times, until constant peak heights (or areas) and retention times are achieved.\n\n5.3.2. Calibration graph\n\nInject each calibration solution (3.10.3) several times and determine the mean peak heights (areas) for each concentration. Plot a calibration graph using the mean peak heights (areas) as the ordinates and the corresponding concentrations in μg/ml as the abscissae.\n\n5.3.3. Sample solution\n\nInject the sample extracts obtained in 5.2.1 or 5.2.2 several times, using the same volume as taken for the calibration solution and determine the mean peak heights (areas) of the lasalocid sodium peaks.\n\n6. Calculation of results\n\nFrom the mean peak height (area) produced by injection of the sample solution (5.3.3) determine the concentration of lasalocid sodium (μg/ml) by reference to the calibration graph.\n\n6.1. Feedingstuffs\n\nThe lasalocid sodium content, w (mg/kg) in the sample is given by the following formula:\n\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n\nwhere:\n\nß= lasalocid sodium concentration of the sample solution (5.2.1) in μg/ml\n\nV1= volume of the sample extract according to 5.2.1 in ml (i.e. 100)\n\nm= mass of the test portion in g\n\n6.2. Premixtures\n\nThe lasalocid sodium content, w (mg/kg) in the sample is given by the following formula:\n\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n\nwhere:\n\nß= lasalocid sodium concentration of the sample solution (5.2.2) in μg/ml\n\nV2= volume of the sample extract according to 5.2.2 in ml (i.e. 250)\n\nf= dilution factor according to 5.2.2\n\nm= mass of the test portion in g\n\n7. Validation of the results\n\n7.1. Identity\n\nMethods based on spectrofluorimetry are less subject to interference than those in which UV detection is used. The identity of the analyte can be confirmed by co-chromatography.\n\n7.1.1. Co-chromatography\n\nA sample extract (5.2.1 or 5.2.2) is fortified by the addition of an appropriate amount of a calibration solution (3.10.3). The amount of added lasalocid sodium should be similar to the amount of lasalocid sodium found in the sample extract.

Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2146/95 of 8 September 1995 (7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1235/96 (8), transitionally adjusts the special arrangements for imports of olive oil originating in Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey with a view to implementing the Agreement on agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations by derogating from the Council Regulations on imports of olive oil originating in those countries;
Whereas, pursuant to the abovementioned Regulation (EC) No 2146/95, the reductions in levies on unrefined oil applying before 1 July 1995 pursuant to the Council Regulations in force have become reductions in the rate of duty applicable under the same conditions;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1521/76 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 2062/96 to take account of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Community and Morocco; whereas the aim of that amendment is to ensure that the amount to be deducted from the levy includes an amount equal to the special export charge levied by Morocco in the period 1 January 1994 to 31 January 1995 but not exceeding ECU 12,09 per 100 kilograms, plus an additional ECU 12,09 per 100 kilograms; whereas, from 1 February 1995, those amounts are replaced by ECU 14,60 per 100 kilograms in accordance with that amendment;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1(1) thereof,
Whereas Schedule CXL requires an annual import quota to be opened for 53 000 tonnes of frozen beef covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206 29 91; whereas the rules of application should be laid down for the 1998/99 quota year starting on 1 July 1998;
Whereas a method of administration should be applied which is comparable to that used in the past for corresponding quotas; whereas such a method should entail the allocation by the Commission of part of the quantities available to traditional traders and part to traders involved in trade in beef and veal;
Whereas the traditional importers should be allocated 80 % of the quota, i.e. 42 400 tonnes, in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota during the most recent reference period; whereas in certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict traders' access to this part of the quota; whereas steps should be taken to make good any resulting damage;
Whereas traders who can show that they are genuinely involved in trade of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota, i.e. 10 600 tonnes, in accordance with a procedure based on the submission of applications by the parties concerned and their acceptance by the Commission; whereas proof of genuine involvement in trade calls for evidence to be presented of trade of some significance in beef and veal with third countries;
Whereas exports of beef and veal from the United Kingdom have been seriously affected by the controversy over bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), in particular since the end of March 1996; whereas account should be taken of the export situation in the United Kingdom when performance criteria are set with regard to the 10 600 tonnes;
Whereas, if such criteria are to be checked, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is entered in a national VAT register;
Whereas traders no longer involved in trade in beef and veal at 1 April 1998 should be denied access to the quota in order to prevent speculation;
Whereas, save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Commission Regulations (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1404/97 (3), and (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 759/98 (5), are applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation;
Whereas effective management of the quota and fraud prevention in particular require that used licences are to be returned to the competent authorities so they can check that the quantities shown therein are correct; whereas the competent authorities must accordingly be under an obligation to carry out such checks; whereas the security to be lodged when licences are issued should be fixed so it ensures licences are actually used and returned to the competent authorities;

In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the EC Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) be initiated.
(4) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC, Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 139(1) TFEU. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession (10), the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Poland have derogations as defined in Article 139(1) TFEU. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession (11), Bulgaria and Romania have derogations as defined in Article 139(1) TFEU. In accordance with Article 5 of the Act of Accession of Croatia (12), Croatia has a derogation as defined in Article 139(1) TFEU.
(5) The European Central Bank (‘ECB’) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997 (13). The procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 16 March 2006 between the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (14).
(6) Article 140(2) TFEU lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. At least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 140(1) TFEU. On 5 March 2013, Latvia submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment.
(7) National legislation in the Member States, including the statutes of national central banks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and with the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (‘Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB’). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Latvia with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and with the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB.
(8) According to Article 1 of Protocol No 13 on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 140 TFEU, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 140(1) TFEU means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than 1,5 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability, inflation will be measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices (15). In order to assess the price stability criterion, a Member State’s inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. In the one-year period ending in April 2013, the inflation reference value was calculated to be 2,7 per cent, with Sweden, Latvia and Ireland as the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability, with inflation rates of, respectively 0,8 per cent, 1,3 per cent and 1,6 per cent.
(9) According to Article 2 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) TFEU shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) TFEU that an excessive deficit exists.
(10) According to Article 3 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 140(1) TFEU means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency’s bilateral central rate against the euro on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfillment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfillment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending on 16 May 2013.
(11) According to Article 4 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 140(1) TFEU means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than 2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfillment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 2 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in April 2013 was 5,5 per cent.
(12) In accordance with Article 5 of Protocol No 13, the data used in the assessment of the fulfillment of the convergence criteria is to be provided by the Commission. For the preparation of this Decision the Commission provided data. Budgetary data were provided by the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 April 2013 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 (17) on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure.
(13) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfillment by Latvia of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, it is concluded that:
(a) in Latvia, national legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 130 and 131 TFEU and with the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB;
(b) regarding the fulfillment by Latvia of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 140(1) TFEU:
— the average inflation rate in Latvia in the year ending in April 2013 stood at 1,3 per cent, which is well below the reference value, and it is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead,
— the budget deficit in Latvia has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 per cent of GDP by the end of 2012. By Decision 2013/317/EU of 21 June 2013, (18) the Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, abrogated Decision 2009/591/EC (19) on the existence of an excessive deficit in Latvia,
— Latvia has been a member of ERM II since 2 May 2005; upon ERM II entry, the authorities unilaterally committed to keep the lats within the ± 1 % fluctuation margin around the central rate. During the two years preceding this assessment, the lats exchange rate did not deviate from its central rate by more than ± 1 % and it did not experience tensions,
— in the year ending April 2013, the long-term interest rate in Latvia was, on average, 3,8 per cent, which is below the reference value.
(c) in the light of the assessment on legal compatibility and on the fulfilment of the convergence criteria as well as the additional factors, Latvia fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro,","{'header': '18.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 195/24', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 9 July 2013\non the adoption by Latvia of the euro on 1 January 2014\n(2013/387/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The third stage of economic and monetary union (‘EMU’) started on 1 January 1999.

Such outliers were in the past identified in the 2004 and 2010 Convergence Reports. At the current juncture, it is warranted to exclude Greece from the best performers, as its inflation rate and profile deviate by a wide margin from the euro area average, mainly reflecting the severe adjustment needs and exceptional situation of the Greek economy, and including it would unduly affect the reference value and thus the fairness of the criterion(16).\n\n((9)) According to Article 2 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 140(1) TFEU shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 126(6) TFEU that an excessive deficit exists.\n\n((10)) According to Article 3 of Protocol No 13, the criterion on participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 140(1) TFEU means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133, in conjunction with Article 300(2) subparagraph 1, first sentence thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part(1), provides for certain reciprocal trade concessions for certain agricultural products.
(2) Article 21(5) of the Europe Agreement provides that the Community and Bulgaria shall examine product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis the possibilities of granting each other further concessions.
(3) The first improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Bulgaria were provided for in the Protocol adjusting trade aspects of the Europe Agreement to take account of the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations on agriculture, including improvements to the existing preferential arrangements, approved by Council Decision 1999/278/EC(2).
(4) Improvements to the preferential arrangements were also provided for as a result of negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade concluded in 2000. On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 July 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2290/2000 of 9 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Bulgaria(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol.
(5) Negotiations for further improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Bulgaria were concluded on 18 October 2002.
(6) The new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the Protocol) should be approved with a view to consolidating all concessions in agricultural trade between the two sides, including the results of the negotiations concluded in 2000 and 2002.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4) has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations. Certain tariff quotas under this Decision should therefore be administered in accordance with those rules.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 364/2005
of 3 March 2005
fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '4.3.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 58/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 364/2005\nof 3 March 2005\nfixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1), and in particular Article 142(c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 (2) provides, in its Article 23(1) and Article 24, for reductions to be applied in the case of late submission of a single application as well as of documents, contracts and declarations which are constitutive for the eligibility of the aid, and of an application for allocation of payment entitlements.
(2) In accordance with Article 11(2) and Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009, Italy has fixed 15 May 2014 as the latest day until which single applications and applications for allocation of payment entitlements for 2014 can be submitted.
(3) On 3 May 2014 certain parts of the Italian region of Marche were subject to exceptional rainfall leading to flooding, damages to infrastructure, landslides, evacuation of citizens, as well as damages to agricultural holdings and crops.
(4) This situation has affected the ability of applicants to submit single applications and applications for allocation of payment entitlements relating to agricultural parcels in the affected municipalities within the time limits provided for in Article 11(2) and Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009.
(5) By way of derogation from Article 23(1) and Article 24 of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 it is therefore appropriate not to apply reductions on grounds of late submission of single applications and applications for allocation of payment entitlements in respect of those farmers who submitted their applications relating to at least one agricultural parcel within the municipalities defined by Italy as having been subject to severe flooding in the region of Marche by 9 June 2014 at the latest.
(6) Since the derogations should cover the single applications and applications for allocation of payment entitlements for aid year 2014, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies retroactively.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 95/408/EC of 22 June 1995 on the conditions for drawing up, for an interim period, provisional lists of third country establishments from which Member States are authorised to import certain products of animal origin, fishery products or live bivalve molluscs (1), as last amended by Council Decision 98/603/EC (2), and in particular Article 2(4) and Article 7 thereof,
Whereas Council Directive 92/118/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC (4), lays down that animal casings can be imported from any third country;
Whereas Council Directive 77/99/EEC (5), as last amended by Council Directive 97/76/EC (6), lays down conditions governing the production, placing on the market and import of cleaned, salted or dried and/or heated stomachs, bladders and intestines;
Whereas, for third countries the health and veterinary certification requirements for importation of animal casings have been laid down in Commission Decision 94/187/EC (7), as last amended by Decision 96/106/EC (8);
Whereas the Commission has received from certain third countries lists of establishments, with guarantees that they fully meet the appropriate Community health requirements and that should an establishment fail to do so its export activities to the European Community will be suspended;
Whereas the Commission has been unable to ascertain in all the third countries concerned the compliance of their establishments with the Community requirements and the validity of the guarantees provided by the competent authorities;
Whereas, the period during which Member States were able to continue to import animal casings from the establishments they have recognised would expire on 31 December 1998;
Whereas on the expiry of that period third countries which have not transmitted their lists of establishments in accordance with the Community rules would no longer be permitted to export animal casings to the Community;
Whereas provisional lists of establishments producing animal casings can thus be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Decision 95/408/EC in respect of certain countries;
Whereas however some third countries have not sent their establishment lists in time and due to technical problems the establishment of a health certificate is delayed; whereas it is therefore necessary to grant as a transitional measure an additional period to import casings, stomachs and bladders from these third countries in order not to interrupt trade; whereas in this event, the competent authority of the third countries concerned must certify that the casings, stomachs and bladders have been produced under appropriate hygienic conditions;

""Different types of steering equipment""        1.2.1. Depending on the source of power which is necessary for the deflection of the steered wheels, the following types of steering equipment are identified:          1.2.1.1. Manual steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided solely by the muscular power of the driver;\n\n1.2.1.2. Assisted steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided both by the muscular power of the driver and by the special equipment referred to in 1.1.4;\n\nSteering equipment where the steering power is normally provided solely by the special equipment referred to in 1.1.4, but which in the event of failure of the special equipment enables the muscular power of the driver to be used for steering, shall be considered as ""assisted steering equipment"".\n\n1.2.1.3. Servo-steering equipment, in which the steering power is provided solely by the special equipement referred to in 1.1.4.\n\n1.3. Steering effort\n\n""Steering effort"" means the force exerted by the driver on the steering control in order to steer the tractor.\n\n2. CONSTRUCTION, FITTING AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS      2.1. General requirements        2.1.1. The steering equipment must ensure easy and safe handling of the tractor and must comply with the detailed requirements set out in 2.2.\n\n2.2. Detailed requirements       2.2.1. Steering control         2.2.1.1. The steering control must be easy to use and grip. It must be designed in such a way as to permit gradual deflection. The direction of movement of the steering control must correspond to the desired change in the direction of the tractor.\n\n2.2.1.2. The steering effort required to achieve a turning circle of 12 m radius, starting from the straight ahead position, must not exceed 25 daN. In the case of assisted steering equipment, if the auxiliary power supply fails the steering effort required must not exceed 60 daN.\n\n2.2.1.3. In order to check compliance with the requirement in 2.2.1.2, the tractor shall describe a spiral movement at a speed of 10 kilometres per hour, starting from the straight ahead position, on a dry, flat road surface offering good tyre adhesion. The steering effort on the steering control shall be noted until it reaches the position corresponding to the tractor entering a turning circle of 12 m radius. The duration of the manoeuvre (time between the moment when the steering control is first operated and the moment when it reaches the position where the measurements are taken) must not exceed five seconds in normal cases and eight seconds if the special equipment fails. One manoeuvre must be made to the left and one to the right.\n\nFor the test, the tractor must be loaded to its technically permissible maximum weight ; tyre pressures and weight distribution between the axles must conform to the manufacturer\'s instructions.\n\n2.2.2. Steering gear        2.2.2.1. The steering equipment may not include either electrical or wholly pneumatic steering gear.\n\n2.2.2.2. The steering gear must be so designed as to meet any operational requirements It must be easily accessible for maintenance and inspection.\n\n2.2.2.3. In the case of steering gear which is not wholly hydraulic, it must be possible to drive the tractor even in the event of failure of the hydraulic or pneumatic components of the steering gear.\n\n2.2.2.4. Steering gear which is operated purely hydraulically and the special equipment mentioned in 1.1.4, must meet the following requirements:          2.2.2.4.1. One or more pressure limitation devices must protect the whole or part of the circuit against excess pressure;\n\n2.2.2.4.2. The pressure limitation devices must be set so as not to exceed a pressure T equal to the maximum operating pressure stated by the manufacturer.\n\n2.2.2.4.3.  The characteristics and dimensions of the pipe work must be such that the pipes withstand four times the pressure T (permitted by the pressure limitation devices), and must be protected in places and arranged in such a way that the risks of damage by impact or interference are reduced to a minimum, and the risks of damage by rubbing can be considered negligible.\n\n2.2.3. Steered wheels        2.2.3.1. All the wheels may be steered wheels.\n\n2.2.4. Special equipment         2.2.4.1. The special equipment defined in 1.1.4, used in the types of steering equipment defined in 1.2.1.2 and 1.2.1.3, shall be acceptable in the following circumstances:           2.2.4.1.1. If the tractor is equipped with assisted steering equipment as defined in 1.2.1.2, it must be possible to drive it even in the event of failure of the special equipment as already stated in 2.2.1.2. If the assisted steering equipment does not have its own source of power, it must be fitted with a power reservoir. This power reservoir may be replaced by a self-contained device providing power supply to the steering equipment with priority over the other systems which are linked to the common energy source. The steering and braking systems must not have a common source of energy. If the source of power is compressed air, the air reservoir must be protected by a non-return valve.\n\nWhere the steering power is normally provided solely by the special equipment referred to in 1.1.4, the assisted steering equipment must be fitted with a device such that if, in the event of failure of the special equipment, the steering effort exceeds 25 daN, a visual or acoustic signal must give warning of such failure.\n\n2.2.4.1.2.If the tractor is fitted with servo-steering equipment as defined in 1.2.1.3, and provided that such equipment has a wholly hydraulic steering gear, it must be possible, should the special device fail, to carry out the two manoeuvres specified in 2.2.1.3 using a special additional device. The special additional device may be a compressed air or gas reservoir. An oil pump or compressor may be used as the special additional device if that device is worked by the rotation of the tractor wheels and cannot be disconnected from them. In the event of failure of the special equipment, a visual or acoustic signal must give warning of such failure.         2.2.4.1.2.1. If the special device is pneumatic, it must be fitted with a compressed air reservoir protected by a non-return valve. The capacity of the compressed air reservoir must be calculated so that at least seven complete turns (from lock to lock) are possible before the reservoir pressure falls to half its operating pressure ; the test must be carried out with the steered wheels off the ground.'}]}"

authorizing methods for grading pig carcases in Germany

(89/471/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 4 (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 of 13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3530/86 (4), and in particular Article 5 (2) thereof,
Whereas Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 provides that the grading of pig carcases must be determined by estimating the content of lean meat in accordance with statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase; whereas the authorization of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment; whereas this tolerance has been defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases (5);
Whereas the Commission, by its Decision 87/43/EEC (6), has authorized methods for grading pig carcases in Germany;
Whereas their application has shown that the results of the three authorized methods are difficult to compare;
Whereas with a view to improving the transparency of the market, the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has requested the Commission to authorize the use of one main method on its territory consisting in the fixing of measuring points and of a single estimation formula for the lean meat content and has submitted for this purpose the information required in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85; whereas an examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorizing the said grading methods are fulfilled;
Whereas, however, the method to be thus authorized concerning the taking of measurements is based on the use of the apparatus 'Ultrasound-Scanner' ('SSD 256') the use of which in the abattoirs in general does not seem to be possible in practice; whereas as a consequence it is appropriate, subject to supervision by the Commission, to authorize the use of other apparatus for the grading of pig carcases after they have passed a calibration test by giving equivalent results concerning the values of assessment measurements of the percentage of lean meat to those obtained by the use of the 'Ultrasound-Scanner' ('SSD 256');
Whereas it is necessary, in addition, to maintain a simple method for small abattoirs which are not in a position to bear investment costs engendered by the method mentioned above; whereas for this reason it is appropriate for the moment to continue the use of the method known as 'Zwei-Punkt-Messverfahren' but to limit its use to abattoirs which do not exceed a fixed amount of slaughterings;
Whereas a new decision should be adopted for the sake of clarity to include the two methods mentioned above; whereas, as a consequence, Decision 87/43/EEC should be repealed;
Whereas no modification of apparatus or grading method may be authorized except by means of a new Commission decision adopted in the light of experience gained; whereas, for this reason, the present authorization may be revoked;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,","{'title': '89/471/EEC: Commission Decision of 14 July 1989 authorizing methods for grading pig carcases in Germany (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 26(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 26(1)(a), Member States should report each year on the quantities of methyl bromide authorised for quarantine and pre-shipment pursuant to Article 12(2), as well as on the quantities of methyl bromide authorised in case of emergency pursuant to Article 12(3).
(2) The deadline of 18 March 2010 contained in Article 12(1) has elapsed and methyl bromide can no longer be placed on the market and used for quarantine and for pre-shipment applications. There is therefore no need to continue asking Member States to report each year on methyl bromide authorised for quarantine and pre-shipment pursuant to Article 12(2).
(3) The temporary authorisation of methyl bromide in emergency cases pursuant to Article 12(3) requires for each case a specific decision of the Commission.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having regard to the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulties (1),
Whereas:
(1) The Commission adopted a decision on 10 May 2007 on the measures C 1/06 (ex NN 103/05) implemented by Spain for Chupa Chups (2).
(2) Following an appeal lodged by Chupa Chups S.A. (Chupa Chups) before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities against the decision in question, the Commission concluded that it had committed an error of assessment as regards one part of measure 4 (EUR 800 000 granted in 2003 under a regional aid scheme).
(3) In point 43 of the contested decision, the Commission noted that it had been made clear that the regional aid scheme could not apply to companies in difficulties. Given the heavy losses incurred by Chupa Chups in 2002 (EUR 22 078 000, corresponding to 86,5 % of the subscribed capital at the end of the financial year) and the 2003 results, the Commission considered that Chupa Chups had to be regarded as a company in difficulties at the time the aid was granted. The Commission concluded that this part of the aid was thus incompatible with the common market and could therefore not be implemented.
(4) Concerning the EUR 800 000 of regional aid granted in 2003 under the ‘Minería 2’ programme, the Commission notes that this aid forms part of an approved aid scheme (3). Furthermore, contrary to its first assessment at the initiation of the formal investigation procedure, the Commission considers that Chupa Chups was eligible for this aid since, at the time the aid was granted, the company was not in difficulties (4). In particular:
(a) despite the heavy losses of EUR 22 078 000 incurred in 2002, at the end of that financial year Chupa Chups accounts still showed reserves of around EUR 59 930 000. Those reserves were sufficient to absorb all the losses, which therefore had no impact on the company’s subscribed capital of EUR 12 million. Moreover, after deduction of the 2002 losses, Chupa Chups still had equity of EUR 49 850 000;
(b) the Commission considers that many of the usual signs of a firm in difficulty, as described in point 6 of the guidelines, were not present in the period 2002-2003. In particular, the rate of losses diminished (5), as did debts (both long- and short-term) and stock inventories (6), whereas financial expenses remained stable;
(c) finally, Chupa Chups’ positive evolution since 2002-2003 has made it apparent that the company did not fall under the general criterion in point 4 of the guidelines, according to which a firm is to be regarded as being in difficulty ‘where it is unable, whether through its own resources or with the funds it is able to obtain from its owner/shareholders or creditors, to stem losses which, without outside intervention by the public authorities, will almost certainly condemn it to going out of business in the short or medium term’.
(5) In the appeal, it is argued that Chupa Chups was not a company in difficulties within the meaning of point 5(a) of the 1999 Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty (7). In the Guidelines, a firm is regarded as being in difficulty where more than half of its registered capital has disappeared and more than one quarter of that capital has been lost over the preceding 12 months.
(6) Even if Chupa Chups had losses corresponding to more than half of its subscribed capital, the criterion that more than half of the subscribed capital has disappeared is not met in this case, because Chupa Chups had other reserves.
(7) The Commission must therefore reconsider its assessment and amend the Decision of 10 May 2007 as regards the assessment of the aid of EUR 800 000 envisaged in measure 4.
(8) The Decision of 10 May 2007 on the measures C 1/06 (ex NN 103/05) implemented by Spain for Chupa Chups must therefore be amended,","{'header': '2.9.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 235/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 11 March 2008\namending the Commission Decision of 10 May 2007 on the measures C 1/06 (ex NN 103/05) implemented by Spain for Chupa Chups\n(notified under document number C(2008) 868)\n(Only the Spanish text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/696/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Commission adopted a decision on 10 May 2007 on the measures C 1/06 (ex NN 103/05) implemented by Spain for Chupa Chups(2).\n\n((2)) Following an appeal lodged by Chupa Chups S.A.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(2), and in particular point (a) of the second subparagraph of Article 18(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 19 of that Regulation; whereas the same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality; the latter is defined in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 431/68 of 9 April 1968 determining the standard quality for raw sugar and fixing the Community frontier crossing point for calculating cif prices for sugar(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3290/94(4); furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 19(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999; candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(5); the refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry. Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.
(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.
(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(5) Germany notified the Commission of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in a holding on its territory where poultry are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, which should be defined in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.
(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Germany, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holding where the outbreak was confirmed.
(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly describe the protection and surveillance zones established in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany at Union level.
(8) Accordingly, the protection and surveillance zones in Germany, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '23.12.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 367/115', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 19 December 2014\nconcerning certain protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in Germany\n(notified under document C(2014) 10261)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/945/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry.

derogating from prohibitions relating to African swine fever for certain areas in Spain

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (1), as last amended by Directive 88/406/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9a thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/461/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (3), as last amended by Directive 87/489/EEC (4), and in particular Article 8a thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 80/215/EEC of 22 January 1980 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (5), as last amended by Directive 87/491/EEC (6), and in particular Article 7a thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 9a (1) of Directive 64/432/EEC, Article 8a (1) of Directive 72/461/EEC and Article 7a (1) of Directive 80/215/EEC, a derogation from the prohibition on the export of live swine, fresh pigmeat and certain meat products may be granted for one or more parts of the territory of a Member State where African swine fever has been recorded within the previous 12 months;
Whereas a derogation as referred to in the above provisions, complies with Article 9b (1) of Directive 64/432/EEC, Article 8b (1) of Directive 72/461/EEC and Article 7b (1) of Directive 80/215/EEC; whereas in particular it takes account of the methods for monitoring and eradicating African swine fever, of disease-free status for at least 12 months, of the part or parts of the territory and their administrative and geographical boundaries, of the protective measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease and of the measures taken to monitor the movements of swine;
Whereas the Spanish authorities have undertaken, in particular in a letter of 14 October 1988 to the Commission, to implement all measures providing the necessary guarantees;
Whereas the Spanish authorities have also undertaken to implement, by 14 December 1988 at the latest, the measures set out below;
Whereas to that end:
- a ban has been introduced on movements of swine and fresh pigmeat from areas where African swine fever has been recorded to areas designated as qualifying under a derogation relating to intra-Community trade; whereas pigmeat products which have undergone treatment involving natural fermentation and maturation of the type laid down for products such as Serrano ham, Chorizo and Lomo manufactured in areas where African swine fever has been recorded may be marketed and consumed in the areas designated as qualifying under a derogation provided that the fresh pigmeat used for the manufacture comes from swine which have undergone a serological test immediately prior to slaughter and have been found free of antibodies of the African swine fever virus,
- meat products from the area designated as qualifying under a derogation relating to intra-Community trade must be stored and transported separately from meat products from areas where African swine fever has been recorded,
- a system for the identification of slaughter pigs, which forms part of the national identification system for swine, has been adopted throughout Spain,
- the serological screening programme for African swine fever must continue to be applied throughout Spain,
- the systematic slaughter policy is also to apply to a pig herd where only one or a few sero-positive pigs are identified in the said herd,
- the systematic slaughter policy is to provide in all parts of Spain that:
(a) an epidemiological investigation is to be carried out. The investigation is to take account of movement to and from the infected site of persons, livestock, vehicles, meat and any other material which may carry the African swine fever virus;
(b) herds identified as possibly infected as a result of the epidemiological investigation are to be declared prohibited immediately and must undergo a clinical, serological and virological examination as appropriate;
(c) a protection zone with a radius of three kilometres is to be established and signs are to be set up on all major roads to mark the borders of the zone;
Whereas, in addition, in areas designated as qualifying under a derogation relating to intra-Community trade, the systematic slaughter policy must entail, without prejudice to restrictive measures to be implemented in trade:
- a surveillance zone for swine with a radius of at least 10 kilometres, taking into account geographical boundaries. The zone must be established for at least 30 days. Swine may not leave the holdings on which they are kept during the first 15 days. Between the 15th day and the 30th day the pigs may not leave the holding except to be transported under official supervision directly to a slaughterhouse for immediate slaughter. Such transport may be authorized by the competent authority only after:
(a) the official veterinarian has carried out an examination of all swine on the holding and confirmed that none of the swine may be suspected of being infected with African swine fever;
(b) a serological examination has been carried out on all swine on the holding without detecting African swine fever antibodies. Only swine intended far slaughter, however, must undergo a serological examination, when the serological screening programme referred to in the following indent has been completed on the holding in question without African swine fever antibodies being detected;
- all herds within the surveillance zone are to be subject to a serological screening programme for African swine fever,
- meat originating from swine sent to a slaughterhouse in accordance with the provisions in the first indent may only be used in meat products which have undergone in the course of manufacture treatments as referred to in Article 4 (1) (a) of Directive 80/215/EEC,
- movements of fresh meat and meat products excepting products which have undergone treatments as referred to in Article 4 (1) (a) of Directive 80/215/EEC from the protection zone are to be prohibited for 30 days;
Whereas, in the light of the commitments referred to in the above recitals, provisions may be made for a derogation from the prohibitions relating to African swine fever for certain parts of the territory of Spain;
Whereas, provision should be made for a period of time before authorizing the Kingdom of Spain to consign live swine, fresh meat and certain meat products from certain parts of its territory;
Whereas, where African swine fever breaks out in one or more areas in that part of Spain qualifying under a derogation from prohibitions relating to African swine fever, the Member States are to continue to be able to adopt the necessary protective measures, in particular, under Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC, Article 8 of Directive 72/461/EEC and Article 7 of Directive 80/215/EEC;

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '10.8.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 210/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 950/2007\nof 9 August 2007\nfixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other.

It may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.\n\n((9)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 10 August 2007.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nto Commission Regulation of 9 August 2007 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nRefunds\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n20,99\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09400\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1102\xa020\xa090\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa040\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n26,98\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09300\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n20,99\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09500\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1103\xa013\xa090\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1103\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa060\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa020\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa069\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09110\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,98\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09130\nC10\nEUR/t\n19,49\n1104\xa029\xa001\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa003\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa020\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n22,49\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,24\n1104\xa029\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa051\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa055\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n3,75\n1107\xa010\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1107\xa010\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,98\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,98\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,98\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,98\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1109\xa000\xa000\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa051\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,50\n1702\xa030\xa059\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1702\xa030\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,50\n1702\xa030\xa099\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1702\xa040\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,50\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,99\n1702\xa090\xa075\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1702\xa090\xa079\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,09\n2106\xa090\xa055\xa09000\nC14\nEUR/t\n17,99\nNB:\nThe product codes and the ‘A ’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10\n:\nAll destinations\nC14\n:\nAll destinations except for Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n(\n1\n)\nNo refund shall be granted on products given a heat treatment resulting in pregelatinisation of the starch.\n(\n2\n)\nRefunds are granted in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2730/75 (\nOJ L 281, 1.11.1975, p. 20\n), as amended.'}]}"

authorizing the United Kingdom to apply, in respect of certain supplies to unregistered resellers, a measure derogating from Article 11 A (1) (a) of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes
(89/534/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 27 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, under Article 27 (1) of the Sixth Directive, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas the United Kingdom was authorized by Council Decision 85/369/EEC (2), deemed to have been adopted on 13 June 1985, in accordance with the procedure laid down by Article 27 (4) of the Sixth Directive, to introduce for a two-year period a derogation from the Sixth Directive to combat tax avoidance;
Whereas certain marketing structures based on sales of goods effected by taxable persons to non-taxable persons with a view to their resale at the retail stage result in avoidance of tax at the stage of final consumption;
Whereas, in order to prevent such tax avoidance, the United Kingdom applies a measure permitting the tax authorities to adopt administrative decisions the effect of which is to tax supplies made by the taxable persons operating such marketing structures on the basis of the open market value of the goods at the retail stage;
Whereas that measure constitutes a derogation from Article 11 A (1) (a) of the Sixth Directive, which stipulates that, within the territory of the country, the taxable amount in respect of supplies of goods is everything which constitutes the consideration which has been, or is to be, obtained by the supplier from the purchaser or a third party for such supplies;
Whereas the United Kingdom was authorized by the Council Decision deemed to have been adopted on 25 May 1987 (3) to extend for two years the derogation authorized by Decision 85/369/EEC;

Whereas the United Kingdom, by letter received by the Commission on 24 February 1989, requested authorization to extend the said measure for an indefinite period;

Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provide that the production refund applying to raw sugar, sucrose syrups and unprocessed isoglucose is to be derived from the refund fixed for white sugar in accordance with a method of calculation specific to each basic product.
(3) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provides that the production refund on white sugar is to be fixed at monthly intervals commencing on the first day of each month. It may be adjusted in the intervening period where there is a significant change in the prices for sugar on the Community and/or world markets. The application of those provisions results in the production refund fixed in Article 1 of this Regulation for the period shown.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 68(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a Community Strategy Concerning Mercury (2) the Commission outlined that it is necessary to reduce mercury levels in the environment and human exposure and proposed as objectives, among others, the reduction of entry into circulation of mercury in society, by cutting supply and demand, the reduction of mercury emissions and the protection against mercury emissions. That Communication was reviewed in 2010 (3).
(2) The Council has reaffirmed several times its commitment to the overall objective of protecting human health and the environment from the release of mercury and its compounds by minimising and, where feasible, ultimately eliminating global anthropogenic mercury releases to air, water and land. In this context, the Council underlined that mercury-added products, where viable alternatives exist, should be phased out as rapidly and as completely as possible, with the ultimate goal that all mercury-added products should be phased-out, taking into due account technical and economic circumstances and the needs for scientific research and development (4).
(3) Mercury and its compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems and wildlife. High doses can be fatal to humans, but even relatively low doses can have serious adverse neurodevelopmental impacts and have also been linked with possible harmful effects on the cardiovascular, immune and reproductive systems. Mercury is considered as a global persistent pollutant, circulating between air, water, sediments, soil and biota in various forms and can change in the environment into methylmercury, its most toxic form.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that, if a Member State considers that the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not adequately controlled and needs to be addressed, it shall prepare a dossier after notifying that intention to the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter ‘the Agency’).
(5) Pursuant to Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 25/2008 of 14 March 2008 amending Annex II (Technical regulations, standards, testing and certification) to the EEA Agreement (5), Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 was incorporated into the Agreement on the European Economic Area.
(6) Norway has prepared a dossier concerning five phenylmercury compounds, namely phenylmercury acetate, phenylmercury propionate, phenylmercury 2-ethylhexanoate, phenylmercury octanoate and phenylmercury neodecanoate, which demonstrates that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary to address the risk to human health and the environment posed by the manufacture, use and placing on the market of those substances, on their own, in mixtures and articles. That dossier was submitted to the Agency in order to initiate the restriction process.
(7) The five phenylmercury compounds are known to be used especially as catalysts in polyurethane systems used for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomer applications. The mercury catalysts are incorporated into the polymer structure and remain in the final article from which mercury or phenylmercury compounds are not released intentionally. Other phenylmercury compounds are not known to be used as catalysts in polyurethane systems and therefore they were not included in the assessment performed in the dossier.
(8) The life-cycle of the phenylmercury compounds leads to a significant release of mercury to the environment and adds to the overall emissions of mercury. In particular, the phenylmercury compounds are degraded in the environment and give degradation products, including methylmercury, with equivalent level of concern to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs). The interconversion of metabolites of phenylmercury compounds allows for long range transport properties. Therefore as transformation/degradation products with PBT-properties are being generated, the phenylmercury compounds themselves must be treated like PBT-substances with regard to emission and exposure control. To this end, the exposures and emissions to humans and the environment should be minimised as much as possible.
(9) The main exposure to humans via the environment may be through food, in which the phenylmercury compounds degradation products, including methylmercury, may be found. Methylmercury biomagnifies especially in the aquatic food chain, making human population and wildlife with a high intake of fish and seafood particularly vulnerable. Methylmercury readily passes both the placental barrier and the blood-brain barrier, inhibiting potential mental development even before birth, making the exposure of women of child-bearing age and children of greatest concern.
(10) On 10 June 2011, the Committee for Risk Assessment of the Agency (RAC) adopted its opinion on the proposed restriction, taking into account its effectiveness in reducing the risks to human health and the environment. Moreover, RAC identified that other organomercury compounds might be used as catalysts in the polymer production. However, these substances were not included in the assessment performed in the dossier.
(11) On 15 September 2011 the Committee for Socioeconomic Analysis of the Agency adopted its opinion on the proposed restriction, taking into account its effectiveness in addressing the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs.
(12) The Agency has submitted to the Commission the opinions of the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socioeconomic Analysis.
(13) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take the measures that may be required to comply with the measures set out in this Regulation.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,","{'header': '20.9.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 253/5', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 848/2012\nof 19 September 2012\namending Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards phenylmercury compounds\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament on a Community Strategy Concerning Mercury(2)the Commission outlined that it is necessary to reduce mercury levels in the environment and human exposure and proposed as objectives, among others, the reduction of entry into circulation of mercury in society, by cutting supply and demand, the reduction of mercury emissions and the protection against mercury emissions.

Mercury is considered as a global persistent pollutant, circulating between air, water, sediments, soil and biota in various forms and can change in the environment into methylmercury, its most toxic form.\n\n((4)) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that, if a Member State considers that the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a substance on its own, in a mixture or in an article poses a risk to human health or the environment that is not adequately controlled and needs to be addressed, it shall prepare a dossier after notifying that intention to the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter ‘the Agency’).\n\n((5)) Pursuant to Decision of the EEA Joint Committee No 25/2008 of 14 March 2008 amending Annex II (Technical regulations, standards, testing and certification) to the EEA Agreement(5), Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 was incorporated into the Agreement on the European Economic Area.\n\n((6)) Norway has prepared a dossier concerning five phenylmercury compounds, namely phenylmercury acetate, phenylmercury propionate, phenylmercury 2-ethylhexanoate, phenylmercury octanoate and phenylmercury neodecanoate, which demonstrates that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary to address the risk to human health and the environment posed by the manufacture, use and placing on the market of those substances, on their own, in mixtures and articles. That dossier was submitted to the Agency in order to initiate the restriction process.\n\n((7)) The five phenylmercury compounds are known to be used especially as catalysts in polyurethane systems used for coatings, adhesives, sealants and elastomer applications. The mercury catalysts are incorporated into the polymer structure and remain in the final article from which mercury or phenylmercury compounds are not released intentionally. Other phenylmercury compounds are not known to be used as catalysts in polyurethane systems and therefore they were not included in the assessment performed in the dossier.\n\n((8)) The life-cycle of the phenylmercury compounds leads to a significant release of mercury to the environment and adds to the overall emissions of mercury. In particular, the phenylmercury compounds are degraded in the environment and give degradation products, including methylmercury, with equivalent level of concern to persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic substances (PBTs). The interconversion of metabolites of phenylmercury compounds allows for long range transport properties. Therefore as transformation/degradation products with PBT-properties are being generated, the phenylmercury compounds themselves must be treated like PBT-substances with regard to emission and exposure control. To this end, the exposures and emissions to humans and the environment should be minimised as much as possible.\n\n((9)) The main exposure to humans via the environment may be through food, in which the phenylmercury compounds degradation products, including methylmercury, may be found. Methylmercury biomagnifies especially in the aquatic food chain, making human population and wildlife with a high intake of fish and seafood particularly vulnerable. Methylmercury readily passes both the placental barrier and the blood-brain barrier, inhibiting potential mental development even before birth, making the exposure of women of child-bearing age and children of greatest concern.\n\n((10)) On 10 June 2011, the Committee for Risk Assessment of the Agency (RAC) adopted its opinion on the proposed restriction, taking into account its effectiveness in reducing the risks to human health and the environment. Moreover, RAC identified that other organomercury compounds might be used as catalysts in the polymer production. However, these substances were not included in the assessment performed in the dossier.\n\n((11)) On 15 September 2011 the Committee for Socioeconomic Analysis of the Agency adopted its opinion on the proposed restriction, taking into account its effectiveness in addressing the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs.\n\n((12)) The Agency has submitted to the Commission the opinions of the Committees for Risk Assessment and Socioeconomic Analysis.\n\n((13)) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take the measures that may be required to comply with the measures set out in this Regulation.\n\n((14)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 10 October 2017.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nIn Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the following entry 62 is added:\n‘62.\n(a)\nPhenylmercury acetate\nEC No: 200-532-5\nCAS No: 62-38-4\n(b)\nPhenylmercury propionate\nEC No: 203-094-3\nCAS No: 103-27-5\n(c)\nPhenylmercury 2-ethylhexanoate\nEC No: 236-326-7\nCAS No: 13302-00-6\n(d)\nPhenylmercury octanoate\nEC No: -\nCAS No: 13864-38-5\n(e)\nPhenylmercury neodecanoate\nEC No: 247-783-7\nCAS No: 26545-49-3\n1.\nShall not be manufactured, placed on the market or used as substances or in mixtures after 10 October 2017 if the concentration of mercury in the mixtures is equal to or greater than 0,01\xa0% by weight.\n2.\nArticles or any parts thereof containing one or more of these substances shall not be placed on the market after 10 October 2017 if the concentration of mercury in the articles or any part thereof is equal to or greater than 0,01\xa0% by weight.’'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Part I of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 98/2003 of 20 January 2003 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the supply of certain essential products for human consumption for processing and as agricultural inputs, and for the supply of live animals and eggs to the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 753/2003(5), establishes a forecast supply balance and Community aid for cereals and cereal products for the French overseas departments.
(2) The forecast supply balance provides for an annual quantity of 40250 tonnes of cereals for Martinique and 4303 tonnes of cereals for French Guiana.

(1) Whereas Article 100c of the Treaty requires the Council to determine the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States;
(2) Whereas the drawing up of the common list annexed to this Regulation represents an important step towards the harmonisation of visa policy; whereas the second subparagraph of Article 7a of the Treaty stipulates in particular that the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of, inter alia, persons is ensured in accordance with the Treaty; whereas other aspects of the harmonisation of visa policy, including the conditions for the issue of visas, are matters to be determined within the appropriate framework;
(3) Whereas risks relating to security and illegal immigration should be given priority consideration when the said common list is drawn up; whereas, in addition, Member States' international relations with third countries also play a role;
(4) Whereas the principle that a Member State may not require a visa from a person wishing to cross its external borders if that person holds a visa issued by another Member State which meets the harmonised conditions governing the issue of visas and is valid throughout the Community or if that person holds an appropriate permit issued by a Member State is a matter that should be determined within the appropriate framework;
(5) Whereas this Regulation should not prevent a Member State from deciding under what conditions nationals of third countries lawfully resident within its territory may re-enter it after having left the territory of the Member States of the Union during the period of validity of their permits;
(6) Whereas, in special cases justifying an exemption where visa requirements would in principle exist, Member States may exempt certain categories of person in keeping with international law or custom;
(7) Whereas, since national rules differ on stateless persons, recognised refugees and persons who produce passports or travel documents issued by a territorial entity or authority which is not recognised as a State by all Member States, Member States may decide on visa requirements for that group of persons, where that territorial entity or authority is not on the said common list;
(8) Whereas it is necessary, when new entities are added to the list, to take account of diplomatic implications and guidelines adopted on the matter by the European Union; whereas, at all events, the inclusion of a third country on the common list is entirely without prejudice to its international status;
(9) Whereas the determination of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States should be achieved gradually; whereas Member States will constantly endeavour to harmonise their visa policies with regard to third countries not on the common list; whereas the present provisions must not prejudice the achievement of free movement of persons as provided for in Article 7a of the Treaty; whereas the Commission should draw up a progress report on harmonisation in the first half of the year 2001;
(10) Whereas, with a view to ensuring that the system is administered openly and that the persons concerned are informed, Member States should communicate to the other Member States and to the Commission the measures which they take pursuant to this Regulation; whereas for the same reasons that information must also be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 574/1999 of 12 March 1999 determining the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 10 November 1986
opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain prepared or preserved fish, falling within heading No ex 16.04 of the Common Customs Tariff, from Portugal (1987)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal and in particular Article 362 thereof,
Having regard to the draft Regulation submitted by the Commission,
Whereas Article 362 of the Act of Accession provides that during the period of progressive elimination of customs duties between the Community of Ten and Portugal, prepared or preserved sardines, prepared or preserved tunny, prepared or preserved mackerel, falling within subheadings 16.04 D, E and ex F of the Common Customs Tariff from Portugal can be imported duty-free into the Community of Ten within the limits of annual Community tariff quotas of 5 000 tonnes, 1 000 tonnes and 1 000 tonnes respectively; whereas these quotas should be opened for 1987;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all importers of the Community of Ten equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for these quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all these Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quotas can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quotas among these Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market in the products concerned, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, assessed by reference to the statistics of each State's imports from Portugal over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports of each Member State represent the following percentages of imports into the Community from Portugal of the product in question:
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member States  // 1983   // 1984  // 1985   //    //   //   //
Sardines
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Benelux   // 7,4   // 6,7   // 6,4   // Denmark   // 1,6   // 2,1   // 2,6   // Germany   // 28,3  // 23,1   // 28,1   // Greece   // 0,2   // 0,1   // -  // France   // 21,4   // 17,0   // 19,0   // Ireland   // 0,2  // 0,1   // 0,3   // Italy   // 5,1   // 4,5   // 7,1  // United Kingdom   // 35,8   // 46,4   // 36,5   //    //  //   //
Tunny
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Benelux   // -   // -   // -  // Denmark   // -   // -   // -   // Germany   // -   // 1,1  // 0,7   // Greece   // -   // -   // 2,1   // France   // 2,9   // 7,2   // 2,1   // Ireland   // -   // -   // -   // Italy  // 97,1   // 91,7   // 95,1   // United Kingdom   // -   // -  // -   //    //   //   //
Mackerel
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Benelux   // 10,3   // 7,4  // 5,7   // Denmark   // -   // -   // -   // Germany   // -  // -   // -   // Greece   // -   // -   // -   // France  // -   // 0,3   // -   // Ireland   // -   // -   // -  // Italy   // 89,7   // 90,0   // 94,3   // United Kingdom  // -   // 2,3   // -   //    //   //   //
Whereas both these percentages and the estimates from certain Member States should be taken into account as well as the need to ensure that, in the circumstances the obligations provided for in the Act of Accession are allocated fairly among the Member States; whereas the approximate percentages of the initial quota shares may therefore be fixed as follows:
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member States   // Sardines  // Tunny   // Mackerel   //    //   //   //   // Benelux  // 7,1   // 1,0   // 10,0   // Denmark   // 1,9   // 1,0  // 1,0   // Germany   // 31,1   // 3,0   // 1,0   // Greece  // 0,2   // 5,0   // 1,0   // France   // 15,0   // 10,0  // 1,0   // Ireland   // 0,3   // 1,0   // 1,0   // Italy  // 4,8   // 77,0   // 84,0   // United Kingdom   // 39,6  // 1,0   // 1,0   //    //   //   //
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, each of the quota amounts should be divided into two instalments, the first instalment being allocated among the Member States which have used up their initial quota shares; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quotas should, under the present circumstances, be fixed at around 80 % of each of the quota amounts;
Whereas the initial quota shares of the Member States may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional quota share from the corresponding reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas, the initial and additional quota shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volumes have been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity of one of the initial shares remains unused in one or other Member State it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve to prevent a part of any Community quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union any operations relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3477/86 of 10 November 1986 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain prepared or preserved fish, falling within heading No ex 16.04 of the Common Customs Tariff, from Portugal (1987)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1987, the applicable cutoms duties on importations into the Community of Ten for the following products shall be suspended at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas as shown herewith:\n\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CCT heading No  // Description  // Quota volume (in tonnes)   // Quota duty  //    //   //   //   //   // 09.0501   // 16.04 D  // Sardines, coming from Portugal   // 5 000   // free  // 09.0502   // 16.04 E   // Tunny, coming from Portugal  // 1 000   // free   // 09.0503   // ex 16.04 F   // Mackerel, coming from Portugal   // 1 000   // free   //    //   //   //  //'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (2) lays down in particular the price conditions to be met when selling products on the Community market.
(2) Products held in intervention storage are intended first and foremost for food and feed uses, to take account of specific situations on the cereals market. However, the quantity and quality of the products in intervention storage may, temporarily and occasionally, make it necessary to dispose of them for other purposes, in particular to meet the Community’s undertakings, where the situation of stocks so warrants and where supply to traditional food markets is not threatened.
(3) The rise in processing cereals to produce biofuels for use in Community transport forms part of a raft of measures designed to meet the Community’s environmental commitments. Promoting the use of biofuels may therefore open a new market for agricultural products held in intervention storage in the Member States, provided that prices applicable to the sale of cereals reflect this specific market in biofuels. Nonetheless, purchasing cereals to produce bioethanol and its use as a biofuel may prove particularly difficult. Provision should therefore be made for selling intervention stocks at special prices in such cases.
(4) Intervention stocks of cereals are sold on the Community market according to availability and market conditions. Sales may be influenced by or dependent upon specific or exceptional circumstances on those markets, and must therefore be able to take account of such situations. To this end, provision should be made for prices that avoid market disturbances and ensure that sales reflect the above circumstances. This twofold objective can be achieved if the selling price is equal to the price on the market concerned, account being taken of the quality of the cereals put up for sale by tender and of transport costs.
(5) In the interests of sound management of the cereals intervention scheme, the information to be communicated by Member States to the Commission should be clarified. This information should be sent by electronic means.
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.

amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) in wet salted fish

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Article 10(3) and Article 30(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) That list may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2).
(3) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) An application for authorisation of the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) in wet salted fish was submitted on 19 June 2009 and has been made available to the Member States.
(5) Fish can be cured and preserved by adding high levels of salt to the raw material. The salting process has been developed from a single step to a multi-step process, involving a pre-salting step which allows a shorter salting time and a relatively homogenous salt concentration in the fish muscle. For this, fish is first pre-salted by injection and/or brine salting with a prepared brine with a controlled salt concentration. After that fish is dry salted (i.e. curing) to get the right salt concentration in the end product.
(6) During this long preservation oxidation can still occur, in particular of the lipids present in the fish muscle. This will lead to a change in colour and flavour. The oxidation is accelerated by the metal ions present in the fish muscle and used salt. Because they form chemical complexes with metals ions, diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) have been proven to be most effective to protect the salted fish against oxidation. Most of the added phosphates and the salt are removed by the soaking with water before consumption. The water content in the final wet salted product is not increased by this use of the phosphates. Salted fish of which the original colour and taste have been preserved is in particular demanded by the markets in Spain, Italy and Greece.
(7) According to Article 3 in conjunction with Article 6(4) of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (3) the use of phosphates in wet salted fish, has to be labelled in the list of ingredients. Food business operators may also mark on their products that polyphosphates have not been used.
(8) As most of the added phosphates are removed during the soaking with water, the exposure of the consumer to the phosphates will be minimal and is for that reason not liable to have an effect on human health. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) for the preservation of wet salted fish.
(9) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) for the preservation of wet salted fish constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.
(10) Bacalhau or Portuguese cod is produced by further drying wet salted fish. The use of polyphosphates could influence this drying process. In addition, this use could also hamper the development of the typical colour and taste of bacalhau. Salted fish that is treated with phosphates would therefore not be desired by the producers of traditional bacalhau. In order to allow the traditional bacalhau producers to adapt to the situation where fish treated with phosphates can be placed on the market a transitional period should be proposed. During this period the traditional bacalhau producers may make agreements with suppliers and become familiar with analytical methods that can be used for controlling the presence of added phosphates in the fish.
(11) In order to further assess the impact on the availability of wet salted fish for the production of bacalhau, the Commission will, during three years, monitor the use of polyphosphates in the main salted cod producing countries.
(12) Following the above, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '31.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 289/58', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1068/2013\nof 30 October 2013\namending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) in wet salted fish\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.\n\n((2)) That list may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings(2).\n\n((3)) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.\n\n((4)) An application for authorisation of the use of diphosphates (E 450), triphosphates (E 451) and polyphosphates (E 452) in wet salted fish was submitted on 19 June 2009 and has been made available to the Member States.\n\n((5)) Fish can be cured and preserved by adding high levels of salt to the raw material.

COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the customs territory of the Community is defined by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1496/68 (4), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession; whereas Article 4 of the abovementioned Regulation provides that it shall not affect the customs system applicable to the continental shelf or that applicable to the waters and foreshores situated between the coast or shore and the limit of territorial waters, or the provisions applicable in accordance with Community rules to be adopted with regard to free zones;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 802/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common definition of the concept of the origin of goods (5) defined in fact the customs system applicable to products taken from the continental shelf; whereas in the current situation there is no reason to integrate the continental shelf adjacent to the territories of the Member States into the customs territory of the Community;
Whereas Council Directive 69/75/EEC of 4 March 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to free zones (6) established the Community rules applicable in those zones;
Whereas, to ensure uniform application of Community customs rules, it should be specified that the field of application of the customs union covers the territorial seas and the airspace of the Member States;
Whereas it is not necessary to maintain the protective provisions contained in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1496/68;
Whereas the definition of the common customs territory is designed to establish the geographical space in which all Community customs rules must be applied uniformly, except in the case of specific provisions to the contrary; whereas this should be stated expressly;
Whereas the provisions of this Regulation are without prejudice to either the present arrangements for German internal trade within the meaning of the Protocol on that trade and connected problems or the arrangements applicable to Sant-Pierre-et-Miquelon, a former French overseas territory expressly referred to in Annex IV to the Treaty;
Whereas, in view of the fact that the territorial seas of certain Member States do not currently form part of their national customs territories or are considered as not forming part thereof in respect of certain economic activities carried out there, it should be specified that the customs arrangements in force in the territorial seas of the Member States with regard to drilling or exploitation platforms and to the products intended for supplies for vessels and drilling or exploitation platforms shall apply until the introduction of Community customs provisions in these areas;
Whereas, chiefly for the purposes of applying certain Council Directives on customs matters at national level, certain Member States have referred expressly to their national customs territories; whereas, in order to avoid the introduction, for purely formal reasons, by those Member States of new national legislation in the areas concerned, which would be merely provisional, those Member States should be authorized to maintain such reference until the implementation of Council regulations in this field;
Whereas it should also be stated that the arrangements adopted by the Member States pursuant to Article 2 of Council Directive 68/312/EEC of 30 July 1968 on harmonization of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to: 1. customs treatment of goods entering the customs territory of the Community, 2. temporary storage of such goods (1) do not apply to vessels passing through the territorial seas of the Member States or to aircraft passing through their airspace, where their destination is not a port or airport situated in those Member States;
Whereas, for the sake of clarity, it is desirable to collect all the provisions henceforth applicable with regard to the definition of the customs territory of the Community in a new Regulation, and therefore to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1496/68;

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 28 March 1984
accepting an undertaking in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain, and terminating that proceeding
(84/187/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 20 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for by that Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In July 1983, the Commission received a complaint lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federation (CEFIC) on behalf of producers representing all Community production of pentaerythritol.
The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify initiating a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of pentaerythritol falling within subheading ex 29.04 C I of the Common Customs Tariff (NIMEXE code 29.04-66), originating in Spain, and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporter and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) The exporter and the main importer of the product concerned made their views known in writing. The latter also requested and was granted a hearing.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following companies:
- Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Resem (Montedison Group), Castellanza, Italy,
- Polialco SA, Barcelona, Spain,
(5) The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 September 1982 to 31 August 1983.
B. Normal value
(6) The preliminary investigation to determine the existence of dumping in respect of imports of the product concerned originating in Spain showed that the prices of the like products marketed by the exporter on the Spanish domestic market had, over an extended period of time and in respect of substantial quantities, been lower than all costs in the ordinary course of trade, both fixed and variable, of material and manufacture, plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses as well as a reasonable margin of profit. The normal value was, therefore, determined by adjusting production costs of the product concerned in order to allow a reasonable profit.
C. Export prices
(7) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product originating in Spain and sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(8) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability resulting from differences in conditions and terms of sale.
(9) The exporter claimed that an adjustment should be made for the amount of the import duties on imported raw material used for the production of the product concerned and for which he claimed to be exempted when the product concerned was exported. Furthermore, the exporter claimed that an adjustment should be made for the amount of the export tax rebate ('desgravaciรณn fiscal') refunded to him by the Spanish authorities when the product concerned was exported. This amount was said to be 10,5 % of the fob value of the product concerned plus the general customs tariff of 13 % applicable on imports of the product concerned into Spain. It was considered that the exporter submitted sufficient evidence concerning both claims and the requests were, therefore, granted in conformity with Article 2 (11) of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79.
(10) All comparisons were made at ex-works level.
E. Margin
(11) The above preliminary determination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of the Spanish exporter, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. The weighted average margin amounts to 6,2 %.
F. Injury
(12) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Spain of pentaerythritol increased from 816 tonnes in 1981, when Polialco started exporting the products concerned, to 2 224 tonnes in 1982, which represents an increase of 173 %. During the first six months of 1983 exports to the Community amounted to 1 006 tonnes, which on an annual basis would be 2 012 tonnes. Although this figure is lower than in 1982, it still represents a significant increase compared with the volume exported to the Community in 1981. The market share held by the product concerned originating in Spain increased from 1,7 % in 1981 to 5,1 % in 1982, and amounts to 4,7 % during the period covering the first six months of 1983.
(13) The resale prices of these imports undercut the prices of the Community producers during the investigation period by up to 6 %.
(14) The consequent impact on the Community producers concerned has been a significant reduction of their sales in the Community. Between 1981 and 1982 their sales dropped from 32 852 tonnes to 29 881 tonnes, which means a reduction of 9 %. During the first six months of 1983, sales by Community producers amounted to 14 016 tonnes, which on an annual basis would represent a decrease of 6 % between 1982 and 1983. Furthermore, the market share held by the Community producers concerned dropped from 70,3 to 68,9 % between 1981 and 1982 and amounted to 66,1 % during the first six months of 1983. With regard to the injury by the Community industry, account should be taken of the fact that one of the main producers of pentaerythritol in the Community had to stop manufacturing the product concerned in the beginning of 1983.
(15) With regard to the prices charged by the Community producers concerned to their customers, a significant price depression occurred in the period 1982/83 on their main markets.
(16) During the same period and particularly during the first six months of 1983, the profits of the Community producers dropped significantly and even turned into losses. (17) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as decline of the consumption in the Community and it has been established that this decline has affected the Community producers more than it has affected the dumped imports. Furthermore, the substantial increase in dumped imports and the prices at which they are offered for sale in the Community led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain taken in isolation have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interest
(18) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken.
H. Undertaking
(19) The exporter concerned was informed of the main findings of the preliminary investigation and commented on them. An undertaking was subsequently offered by Polialco concerning their exports of pentaerythritol to the Community.
(20) The effect of the said undertaking will be to increase the export prices to the extent that the dumping margin will be eliminated. The increase does not exceed the dumping margin found in the investigation.
(21) In these circumstances the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the proceeding may, therefore, be terminated without imposition of an anti-dumping duty.
(22) No objections to this course were raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': '84/187/EEC: Commission Decision of 28 March 1984 accepting an undertaking in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain, and terminating that proceeding', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Commission hereby accepts the undertaking given by Polialco (Barcelona) in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain and falling within Common Customs Tariff subheading ex 29.04 C I, corresponding to NIMEXE code 29.04-66.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 March 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilhelm HAFERKAMP\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 339, 31. 12. 1979, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 178, 22. 6. 1982, p. 9.\n\n(3) OJ No C 244, 13. 9. 1983, p. 2.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/53/EC of 13 June 2002 on the Common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (1), and in particular Article 16(2)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission, in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2002/53/EC, published on 17 September 2004, in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union a list of 17 genetically modified varieties of maize derived from the genetically modified organism MON 810 in the 13th supplement to the 22nd complete edition of the Common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (2).
(2) Pursuant to Article 16(1) of the said Directive, Member States are to ensure that, with effect from the publication referred to in Article 17, seed of varieties accepted in accordance with that Directive or in accordance with the principles corresponding to those of that Directive is not subject to any marketing restrictions relating to the variety.
(3) Article 7(4) of the said Directive provides that genetically modified varieties may only be accepted for inclusion in a national catalogue after having been accepted for marketing in accordance with Council Directive 90/220/EEC (3), now replaced by Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), which provides for the evaluation of the risks for human health and the environment of genetically modified organisms.
(4) Commission Decision 98/294/EC of 22 April 1998 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified maize (Zea mays L. line MON 810) decided pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (5) that consent should be given for the placing on the market of that product. On 3 August 1998, the French authorities effectively allowed the placing on the market of that product.
(5) On 31 March 2005, the Commission received from the Republic of Poland a request for the prohibition, on the basis of Article 16(2) of Directive 2002/53/EC, of the use and placing on the market of seed material from 17 genetically modified varieties of maize line MON 810. A modified request was sent on 24 June 2005 specifying that it was based on Article 16(2)(b). On 9 December 2005, Poland informed the Commission that the request does not apply to the Novelis variety mentioned in the original request. Poland also specified that the request for the remaining varieties is for an unlimited period of time.
(6) From the information available for the 16 varieties concerned, it is well known that they are not suitable for cultivation in any part of Poland because of their too high maturity class which is at least of 350 FAO index or equivalent maturity class. The climatic and agricultural factors concerned provide a permanent obstacle to cultivating these varieties in Poland.
(7) Under these circumstances, the application of the Republic of Poland should be granted on the basis of Article 16(2)(b) for the 16 genetically modified varieties of maize concerned.
(8) In order to allow the Commission to inform the other Member States and update the Common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species provided for in Directive 2002/53/EC, Poland should be required to inform the Commission when it makes use of the authorisation granted by this Decision.
(9) The Republic of Poland has made a similar request for varieties of non-genetically modified maize. As such requests are governed by a different procedure, this will be the subject of a separate decision.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,","{'header': '11.5.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 124/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 8 May 2006\nauthorising the Republic of Poland to prohibit on its territory the use of 16 genetically modified varieties of maize with the genetic modification MON 810 listed in the Common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species, pursuant to Council Directive 2002/53/EC\n(notified under document number C(2006) 1795)\n(Only the Polish text is authentic)\n(2006/335/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Commission, in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 2002/53/EC, published on 17 September 2004, in the C series of theOfficial Journal of the European Uniona list of 17 genetically modified varieties of maize derived from the genetically modified organism MON 810 in the 13th supplement to the 22nd complete edition of the Common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species(2).\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 16(1) of the said Directive, Member States are to ensure that, with effect from the publication referred to in Article 17, seed of varieties accepted in accordance with that Directive or in accordance with the principles corresponding to those of that Directive is not subject to any marketing restrictions relating to the variety.\n\n((3)) Article 7(4) of the said Directive provides that genetically modified varieties may only be accepted for inclusion in a national catalogue after having been accepted for marketing in accordance with Council Directive 90/220/EEC(3), now replaced by Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), which provides for the evaluation of the risks for human health and the environment of genetically modified organisms.\n\n((4)) Commission Decision 98/294/EC of 22 April 1998 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified maize(Zea maysL. line MON 810) decided pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC(5)that consent should be given for the placing on the market of that product.

Whereas Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that each undertaking shall be free to decide to carry forward the whole or part of its sugar production outside its A quota to the next marketing year to be treated as part of that year's production; whereas, in view of the possibility that a sugar-producing undertaking might decide to carry forward the whole of its production outside its A quota, the beet producers concerned should be closely involved in that decision by means of an inter-trade agreement, covering this point, within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 206/68 of 20 February 1968 laying down outline provisions for contracts and inter-trade agreements on the purchase of beet (2), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece; whereas relations between the cane sugar manufacturers and the cane producers in the French overseas departments are the concern of the joint committee of the factory concerned; whereas, therefore, the prior assent of that committee is necessary for the carry-forward of cane sugar;
Whereas the concept of carrying forward can apply only to sugar which has in fact been produced; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide that an undertaking may take a decision to carry forward only in respect of that sugar outside its quota A whose production has been verified by the Member State concerned and to establish the rules for such verification, in particular as regards the information to be supplied for this purpose by the undertaking;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 27 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides for a charge to be levied on any sugar carried forward which is disposed of during the obligatory storage period of 12 consecutive months; whereas, in addition, the disposal of such sugar during that period justifies, as in the case of all other sugar disposed of, the levying of an additional amount equal to the storage levy referred to under (a) of the third subparagraph of Article 8 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81;
Whereas the present Regulation is intended to replace Commission Regulation (EEC) No 103/69 of 20 January 1969 laying down detailed rules for carrying forward part of one year's sugar production to the following marketing year (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 144/69 (4);

(2) Sweden still has intervention stocks of wheat.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2003/99/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC (1), and in particular Article 7(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2003/99/EC, Member States shall ensure that monitoring provides comparable data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic agents and, in so far as they present a threat to public health, other agents.
(2) A FAO/OIE/WHO workshop on scientific assessment on non-human usage of antimicrobials and antimicrobial resistance in 2003 concluded that there is clear evidence of adverse human health consequences due to resistant organisms resulting from non-human usage of antimicrobials: increased frequency of infections, increased frequency of treatment failures (in some cases death) and increased severity of infections, as documented for instance by fluoroquinolone-resistant human Salmonella infections. Evidence shows that the amount and pattern of non-human usage of antimicrobials affect the occurrence of resistant bacteria in animals and food and thereby human exposure to these resistant bacteria (Joint FAO/OIE/WHO Expert Workshop, 2003). However, it should be noted that most of the resistance problems in human medicine are caused by human usage and over usage of antimicrobial agents for therapy and prophylaxis (European Parliament, October 2006).
(3) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicates in its ‘Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic agents, Antimicrobial Resistance and Foodborne Outbreaks in the European Union in 2005’ (2) that a relatively high proportion of Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates from animals and food were resistant to antimicrobials commonly used in treatment of human diseases. Food-borne infections caused by these resistant bacteria pose a particular risk to humans due to possible treatment failure.
(4) The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards and of the Scientific Panel an Animal Health and Welfare of the EFSA, adopted an Opinion on ‘Review of the Community Summary Report on Trends and Sources of Zoonoses, Zoonotic Agents and Antimicrobial Resistance in the European Union in 2004’ (3) during its meeting on respectively 7 and 8 September 2006. With regard to antimicrobial resistance testing, the Opinion indicates the importance to provide detailed information on the Salmonella serovar for each isolate and to harmonise the breakpoints applied for resistance assessment and reporting.
(5) The Task Force on Zoonoses Data Collection of the EFSA adopted a ‘Report including a proposal for a harmonised monitoring scheme of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella in fowl (Gallus gallus), turkeys and pigs and Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli in broilers’ (4) on 20 February 2007. The report makes recommendations on a harmonised monitoring scheme and harmonised methodology for susceptibility testing.
(6) In view of the increasing public health risk posed by antimicrobial resistance and the evidence that use of antibiotics affects this risk, comparable information should be collected from all Member States on the antimicrobial resistance occurrence in zoonotic agents in animals by implementing Article 7 of Directive 2003/99/EC. This implementation should be based on the proposal of the EFSA Task Force but is without prejudice to further implementation rules in the future.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1498/2002 established the portion of each of the quotas concerned reserved for traditional and other importers and the conditions and methods for participating in the allocation of the quantities available. Importers have lodged applications for import licences with the competent national authorities between 23 August 2002 and 3 p.m., Brussels time, on 21 October 2002, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1498/2002.
(2) The Commission has received from the Member States, pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1498/2002, particulars of the numbers and aggregate volume of import licence applications submitted and the total volume imported by traditional importers in 1998 or 1999, the reference years.
(3) The Commission is now able, on the basis of that information, to establish uniform quantitative criteria by which the competent national authorities may satisfy licence applications submitted by importers in the Member States for the 2003 quantitative quotas.
(4) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by traditional importers for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation exceeds or is lower than the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction or increase shown in Annex I to the volume of each importer's imports, expressed in quantity or value terms, over the reference period.
(5) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex II to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 1498/2002.

Whereas, for olive oil falling within CN codes 1509 10 10, 1509 10 90 and 1510 00 10, the special arrangements provide for a flat-rate deduction of ECU 0,7245 per 100 kilograms from the applicable levy, representing the reduction provided for in Article 16 (1) (a) of the Cooperation Agreement; whereas, provided that Algeria levies an export charge, those arrangements provide for a further reduction of that levy corresponding to the amount of the special charge, but not exceeding ECU 14,60 per 100 kilograms, representing the reduction provided for in Article 16 (1) (b) of the Cooperation Agreement and a reduction of ECU 14,60 per 100 kilograms, representing the additional amount provided for in Annex B to the Cooperation Agreement;
Whereas the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (2) provides that the variable levies applied to imports of agricultural products are to be replaced by fixed customs duties from 1 July 1995;

Whereas, in accordance with the Cooperation Agreement, the special export charge should be reflected in the price of the olive oil upon importation into the Community; whereas, to ensure the correct application of the arrengements in question, the necessary measures should be adopted to ensure that the charge is paid at the latest when the oil is imported;
Whereas if the present conditions of the special arrangements provided for in the Cooperation Agreement are amended, in particular as regards the amounts, or if a new agreement is concluded, it may be necessary to adjust this Regulation to incorporate those changes; whereas provision should be made for those adjustments to be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 38 of Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (4);

(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provision of the said Protocol.
(4) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. The Commission addressed such an opinion on Portugal to the Council on 20 July 2005. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4) of the Treaty, the Commission concluded that there exists an excessive deficit in Portugal. In delivering its assessment, the Commission took into account the Ecofin Report to the European Council on ‘Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’, endorsed by the latter on 22 March 2005.
(5) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Portugal, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(6) According to the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme, the planned general government deficit is 6,2 % of GDP for 2005. The deficit is in excess of the 3 % of GDP reference value and not close to it. The excess of the deficit over the reference value does not result from an unusual event outside the control of the Portuguese authorities, nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn. While the rate of GDP growth has declined sharply since 2000, the economy returned to positive economic growth in 2004 and, according to the Commission services Spring 2005 forecasts and the June 2005 updated stability programme, it is expected to remain on a gradual, even if moderate, upward trend for the years to come. Moreover, although the negative output gap is sizeable and not expected to narrow significantly in the coming years, the deterioration of the government balance is out of proportion with the recent widening of the output gap. Therefore, the excess over the reference value cannot be considered as resulting from a severe economic downturn. According to Commission services Spring 2005 forecast, the government deficit ratio is projected to exceed its Treaty reference value by a large margin also in 2006, when the recovery of the economy is expected to gradually take hold. In fact, the June 2005 update of the Portuguese stability programme foresees the government deficit to narrow over the coming years, but to exceed the reference value until 2007.
(7) The excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. This indicates that the Treaty requirement concerning the deficit criterion is not fulfilled.
(8) The debt-to-GDP ratio breached the 60 % of GDP reference value of the Treaty in 2003, reaching to 61,9 % in 2004, an increase of some 8,5 percentage points of GDP since 2000. The increase in the debt ratio can be explained by a very low primary surplus, the existence of a sizeable debt-increasing stock-flow adjustment and also by the low nominal GDP growth. Moreover, the projected debt figures for the years 2005 to 2007, contained in the June 2005 stability programme update, and broadly in line with the debt projections of the Commission services Spring 2005 forecast, suggest a further sharp increase in the debt ratio up to a peak of just below 68 % in 2007. This conflicts with the Treaty requirement that, in the event of an excess over the 60 % of GDP reference value, the ‘debt ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace’. This indicates that the Treaty requirement concerning the debt criterion is not fulfilled either.
(9) According to the Ecofin Report to the European Council on ‘Improving the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact’, taking into account other relevant factors in the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, ‘must be fully conditional on the overarching principle that — before other relevant factors are taken into account — the excess of the reference value is temporary and the deficit remains close to the reference value’. In the case of Portugal, this condition is not met. Therefore, for the purpose of the Council decision in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, other relevant factors are not taken into account in the case of Portugal,","{'header': '20.10.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 274/91', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 20 September 2005\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Portugal\n(2005/730/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2), and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(1) The Commission has received an application for a 'new exporter` review pursuant to Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`). The application was lodged by PT Betadiskindo Binatama, Indonesia, (hereinafter referred to as 'the applicant`) an exporter in Indonesia which claims it did not export the product concerned during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 March 1994 to 28 February 1995 (hereinafter referred to as 'the original investigation period`).
B. PRODUCT
(2) The products concerned are 3,5&Prime; microdisks, used to record and store encoded digital computer information falling within CN code ex 8523 20 90. This code is given for information only.
C. EXISTING MEASURES
(3) By Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 (3) the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 41,1 % on imports of the product concerned originating in Indonesia.
D. GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant has shown that it is not related to the exporter/producer in Indonesia which is subject to the aforementioned anti-dumping measures on the product concerned, and that it started exporting to the Community after the original investigation period.
(5) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(6) In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation with a view to determining the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.
E. REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(7) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned originating in Indonesia which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a determination of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liability cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
F. TIME LIMIT
(8) In the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which interested parties, provided they can show that they are likely to be affected by the results of the investigation, may make their views known in writing and submit supporting evidence. A period should also be fixed, within which interested parties may make a written request for a hearing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
G. NON-COOPERATION
(9) It should be noted that in cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary information within the relevant time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2152/98 of 7 October 1998 initiating a \'new exporter\' review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5"" microdisks) originating in Indonesia, repealing the duty with regard to imports from this exporter and making these imports subject to registration', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nA review of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 is hereby initiated in order to determine if and to what extent imports of 3,5&Prime; microdisks, used to record and store encoded digital computer information falling within CN code ex 8523 20 90 (TARIC code 8523 20 90*10), originating in Indonesia, produced and sold for export to the Community by PT Betadiskindo Binatama, Jl.

of 14 January 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel (GOES) originating in the United States of America (USA) and Russia (the definitive Regulation).
(2) By Decision 2005/622/EC (3), the Commission accepted price undertakings offered by two cooperating exporting producers that were imposed a company specific duty of 31,5 % (AK Steel Corporation, USA) and 11,5 % (Novolipetsk Iron and Steel Corporation (NLMK), Russia) respectively. The country-wide anti-dumping duties applicable to all other companies, except Viz Stal, Russia, subject to a duty of 0 %, are 37,8 % for USA and 11,5 % for Russia.
B.   PRESENT INVESTIGATION
(3) The information at the Commission’s disposal indicated that certain GOES which typically have a thickness of up to 0,1 mm and due, inter alia, to their high electromagnetic efficiency, low weight and low heat development associated with their use possess properties which are not present in other types of GOES. As a result of these characteristics, the use of these products is also considered different and found typically in the aircraft and medical engineering industries. Therefore, it was considered appropriate to review the case as far as the scope of the product is concerned.
(4) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union, initiated a partial interim review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation (4). The investigation was limited in scope to the definition of the product subject to the measures in force in order to assess the need for amendment of the product scope.
C.   PRODUCT UNDER REVIEW
(5) The product under review is grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel, currently classifiable within CN codes 7225 11 00 (of a width of 600 mm or more) and 7226 11 00 (of a width of less than 600 mm). These codes are given only for information.
(6) GOES are produced from hot-rolled coils of silicon alloyed steel of different thicknesses of which the particular grain structure is uniformly directed in order to allow for magnetic conductivity with a high degree of efficiency. Inefficiency with regard to this magnetic conductivity is called ‘core loss’, which is the prime indicator of the quality of the product.
(7) The market is typically divided into high conductivity or high permeability grades and regular grades. The high permeability grades allow achieving lower core losses for any given thickness of the sheets. Such characteristics are especially relevant for industrial producers of electrical power transformers.
D.   INVESTIGATION
(8) The Commission advised the Community producers of GOES, all known Community importers and users as well as all known exporting producers in the USA and Russia of the initiation of the review.
(9) The Commission requested information from all the abovementioned parties and from those other parties who made themselves known within the time limit set in the notice of initiation of the investigation. The Commission also gave the interested parties the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(10) The following companies cooperated in the investigation and provided relevant information to the Commission:
— ThyssenKrupp Electrical Steel GmbH, Gelsenkirchen, Germany,
— Orb Electrical Steels Limited — Cogent Power Limited, Newport, United Kingdom,
— AK Steel Corporation, Butler, Pennsylvania,
— Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
— Novolipetski Iron & Steel Corporation (NLMK), Lipetsk,
— VIZ Stal, Ekaterinburg,
— Arnold Magnetic Technologies, Marengo, Illinois,
— Gebrüder Waasner GmbH, Forchheim, Germany,
— Gebrüder Waasner GmbH, Forchheim, Germany,
— Sangl GmbH, Erlangen, Germany,
— Vacuumschmelze GmbH, Hanau, Germany.
E.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1.   Different identity of ‘ordinary’ versus ‘thin’ GOES producers
(11) None of the producers of GOES, which were investigated in the framework of the procedure leading to the imposition of the measures in force, produce GOES of the thickness as targeted by the current product scope investigation.
(12) Neither ThyssenKrupp Electrical Steel GmbH, nor Orb Electrical Steels Limited (Cogent) produce thin GOES and the same situation applies to the US producers, i.e. AK Steel Corporation and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated, and the Russian producers VIZ Stal and NLMK. Consequently, none of these producers had a direct interest and none of them objected to a possible exclusion of thin GOES from the scope of the measures.
(13) The production of thin GOES requires a process of re-rolling, which is performed by specialised companies of which only two are known to the Commission in the countries concerned: the US producer Arnold Magnetic Technologies and the Russian producer Ileko (Asha), of which only the former company cooperated. As indicated in recitals 10 and 11, there is no such production known in the Community.
2.   Product differentiation
(14) AK Steel Corporation produced thin GOES until 1971, as so-called T-grades. The production process started from fully finished GOES grades (both regular and high permeability), from which the mill coating was removed and where the sheets were re-rolled, re-annealed and re-coated. Specific end-uses were found in the aircraft industry, transformers and a wide variety of electro-technical applications, for which size and the weight of the material is of a decisive importance. It was found that such thin GOES are not interchangeable with other GOES.
(15) It was also examined whether such T-grades consisted of a product which could be distinguished from ‘ordinary’ GOES on the basis of technical characteristics. It was found that the re-rolling production process (consisting of a cold mechanical stretching and flattening process), with re-annealing and re-coating, fundamentally alters the technical specifications of the product, an observation that is corroborated by the disappearance of the original manufacturers’ product guarantee.
(16) It was also found that the physical characteristic of thickness is not limited to 0,10 mm which was the maximal thickness mentioned in the notice of initiation. Most commercially occurring thicknesses are 0,1016 mm and 0,1524 mm which in the USA are commonly referred to as 4 ‘mil’ and 6 ‘mil’. One ‘mil’ stands for a thousand of an inch or 0,0254 mm.
(17) The product definition of thin GOES therefore has to be specified as GOES which are re-rolled to a thickness of maximum 0,16 mm, re-annealed and re-coated.
F.   RETROACTIVE APPLICATION
(18) In view of the above findings that thin GOES have different basic physical and technical characteristics and end-uses than other GOES, it is considered appropriate to exempt imports of GOES of a thickness of maximum 0,16 mm from the anti-dumping measures in force.
(19) Consequently, for goods not covered by Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 as amended by this Regulation, the definitive anti-dumping duties paid or entered in the accounts pursuant to Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 in its initial version should be repaid or remitted.
(20) Repayment or remission must be requested from national customs authorities in accordance with applicable customs legislation.
(21) Since the present review investigation is limited to the clarification of the product and since it was not intended this product type be covered by the original measures, in order to prevent any consequent prejudice to importers of the product, it is considered appropriate that the findings be applied from the date of the entry into force of the definitive Regulation. Moreover, in particular in view of the relatively recent entry into force of the original Regulation and of the expected limited number of requests for refunds, there is no overriding reason not to provide for such retro-active application.
(22) This review does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '19.1.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 16/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 41/2008\nof 14 January 2008\namending Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 shall be replaced by the following:\n‘1.\xa0\xa0\xa0A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel of a thickness of more than 0,16 mm, originating in the United States of America and Russia, falling within CN codes ex\xa07225\xa011\xa000 (products of a width of 600 mm or more) (TARIC code 7225110010) and ex\xa07226\xa011\xa000 (products of a width of less than 600 mm) (TARIC codes 7226110011 and 7226110091).’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 28 August 2005.'}]}"
