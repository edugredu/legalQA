Whereas:
(1) A fishing quota for Atlantic salmon in the Union waters of ICES subdivisions 22-31 was allocated to Poland for 2012 by Council Regulation (EU) No 1256/2011 (2).
(2) The Commission detected inconsistencies in the Polish data about the salmon fishery in 2012 by cross-checking the data recorded and reported during inspected and non-inspected fishing trips. These inconsistencies in catch composition reporting were further corroborated through the conduct of several audit and verification missions in Poland in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009. The evidence gathered allows the Commission to establish that this Member State has exceeded its salmon quota in the year 2012 by 1776 pieces of salmon.
(3) According to paragraph 1 of Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, when the Commission has established that a Member State has exceeded the fishing quotas which have been allocated to it, the Commission shall operate deductions from future fishing quotas of that Member State.
(4) Paragraph 2 of Article 105 of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 provides that deductions from fishing quotas shall be operated in the following year or years.
(5) It is necessary to operate the deductions needed for the restitution of this overfishing on the quota allocated to Poland for Atlantic salmon in 2013. The amount of overfishing is quantified by the Commission in less than 100 tonnes. In accordance with the last sentence of paragraph 2 of Article 105, no multiplying factor should thus be applied to the deduction.
(6) However, if on account of the 2013 quota consumption at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, it will not be possible to operate entirely the deduction amounts due, any remaining quantities should be deducted from the Atlantic salmon quota that may be allocated to this Member State in 2014, in line with the Commission guidelines for the deduction of quotas under Article 105(1), (2) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (3),","{'header': '30.11.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 320/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1223/2013\nof 29 November 2013\nproviding for deduction from salmon fishing quota allocated to Poland in 2013 and subsequent years in ICES subdivisions 22-31 on account of overfishing in 2012', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) A fishing quota for Atlantic salmon in the Union waters of ICES subdivisions 22-31 was allocated to Poland for 2012 by Council Regulation (EU) No 1256/2011(2).\n\n((2)) The Commission detected inconsistencies in the Polish data about the salmon fishery in 2012 by cross-checking the data recorded and reported during inspected and non-inspected fishing trips.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) (1), and in particular Article 4(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2006/771/EC (2) harmonises the technical conditions for short-range devices.
(2) However, due to rapid changes in technology and societal demands, new applications for short-range devices could emerge which would require regular updates of spectrum harmonisation conditions.
(3) On 5 July 2006, the Commission issued a permanent mandate (3) to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), pursuant to Article 4(2) of Decision No 676/2002/EC, to update the Annex to Decision 2006/771/EC in response to the technological and market developments in the area of short-range devices.
(4) In its report (4) of July 2007 submitted in response to that mandate, the CEPT advised the Commission to amend a number of technical aspects in the Annex to Decision 2006/771/EC.
(5) Decision 2006/771/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) Equipment operating within the conditions set in this Decision must also comply with Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity (5) in order to use the spectrum effectively so as to avoid harmful interference, demonstrated either by meeting harmonised standard or by fulfilling alternative conformity assessment procedures.

Whereas, besides making provision for the abolition of restrictions, the General Programmes provide that it should be examined whether such abolition should be preceded, accompanied or followed by mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, and by the co-ordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question, and whether, if need be, transitional measures should be adopted pending such recognition or co-ordination;
Whereas not all Member States impose conditions for the taking up and pursuit of activities in the wholesale coal trade ; whereas:    - in some cases there is freedom to take up and pursue such activities;
- in other cases there are restrictive provisions, which either restrict the freedom to import coal from a Member State to traders who can prove they have already sold a minimum tonnage of coal, or impose legal requirements as to professional qualifications, namely possession of a certificate of professional ability or an equivalent diploma;
Whereas it is therefore not possible to effect the co-ordination provided for at the same time as the abolition of restrictions ; whereas such co-ordination must be effected at a later date;
Whereas, in the absence of immediate co-ordination, it nevertheless appears desirable to make it easier to attain freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in the activities in question by the adoption of transitional measures of the kind envisaged in the General Programmes ; whereas this should be done primarily in order to avoid causing exceptional difficulties for nationals of Member States in which the taking up of such activities is not subject to any conditions;
Whereas, in order to prevent such difficulties arising, the main object of the transitional measures should be to allow, as sufficient qualification for taking up the activities in question in host States which have rules governing the taking up of such activities, proof of the following:    (a) sales of a comparable tonnage over a corresponding period in the country of origin or in the country whence the person concerned comes;  (1)OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.

(b) pursuit of the occupation for a reasonable period of time in the country whence the person concerned comes, such period being in the sufficiently recent past to ensure that such person possesses professional knowledge equivalent to that required of the host country's own nationals;
Whereas the main purpose of the measures provided for in this Directive will disappear once the co-ordination of conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question and the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal evidence of qualifications has been achieved;","{'title': 'Council Directive 70/523/EEC of 30 November 1970 laying down detailed provisions concerning transitional measures in respect of activities of self-employed persons in the wholesale coal trade and in respect of activities of intermediaries in the coal trade (ISIC ex Group 6112)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 9 March 2010
amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to remove tolylfluanid as active substance and on the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the third indent of Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Tolylfluanid is included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, which sets out the list of active substances authorised for use in plant protection products.
(2) By Commission Decision 2007/322/EC of 4 May 2007 laying down protective measures concerning uses of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid leading to the contamination of drinking water (2) it was decided that Member States in which ozone is used for the treatment of drinking water are to prohibit any uses of tolylfluanid which may result in a contamination of drinking water with nitrosamines. The reason for that measure was that it had been discovered that by such a treatment a metabolite of that active substance, N,N-dimethylsulfamide, may be converted into nitrosamines which are harmful to human health.
(3) Under Decision 2007/322/EC Member States further had to ensure that the notifier at whose request tolylfluanid had been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC submitted studies on the leaching behaviour of that active substance and on the conditions under which the formation of nitrosamines can be excluded.
(4) On 5 July 2007, the notifier Bayer CropScience submitted the required studies to the rapporteur Member State, including studies and information on the physical, chemical and toxicological fate and behaviour of the metabolite N,N-dimethylsulfamide and on its ecotoxicological properties.
(5) An addendum to the assessment report, concerning the evaluation of those studies and information, was submitted by the rapporteur Member State to the Commission on 20 February 2008. This addendum was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 22 January 2010.
(6) In this addendum it was concluded that the concerns as regards the leaching behaviour of tolylfluanid and the formation of nitrosamines could not be eliminated. In addition, it was found that the use of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid may lead to unacceptable concentrations of the metabolite N,N-dimethylsulfamide in groundwater. Consequently, it was concluded that tolylfluanid no longer satisfies the requirements of Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) The notifier submitted its comments on the addendum to the assessment report. Those comments were carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and its evaluation have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing tolylfluanid satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Tolylfluanid should therefore be removed from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing tolylfluanid are withdrawn within a fixed period of time as short as possible and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(10) Given the nature of the risks caused by that active substance, any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid should be as short as possible and should expire at latest 1 year from the entry into force of this Directive.
(11) This Directive does not prejudice the submission of an application for tolylfluanid in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in Annex I to that Directive.
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '10.3.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 60/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2010/20/EU\nof 9 March 2010\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to remove tolylfluanid as active substance and on the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Tolylfluanid is included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, which sets out the list of active substances authorised for use in plant protection products.\n\n((2)) By Commission Decision 2007/322/EC of 4 May 2007 laying down protective measures concerning uses of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid leading to the contamination of drinking water(2)it was decided that Member States in which ozone is used for the treatment of drinking water are to prohibit any uses of tolylfluanid which may result in a contamination of drinking water with nitrosamines.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.

(5) Export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third country's exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position.

It concluded, on the basis of records of catches for the period 2007-2011 of surface longliners authorised to fish under the previous protocol to the Partnership Agreement, as validated by the relevant scientific institutes, that it would be appropriate to limit shark catches by such vessels to a maximum of 200 tonnes annually from 1 January 2014 until 31 December 2014, thereby freezing the fishing pressure on these shark stocks in line with the recommendation issued by the IOTC Scientific Committee.
(4) In the light of discussions within the Joint Committee, shark catches should be limited and allocated among the Member States for the period of application of the new Protocol. Regulation (EU) No 1258/2012 should therefore be amended.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community Eco-label award scheme (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Union Eco-labelling Board,
Whereas:
(1) Under Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 the Community Eco-label may be awarded to a product possessing characteristics which enable it to contribute significantly to improvements in relation to key environmental aspects.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 provides that specific Eco-label criteria, drawn up on the basis of the criteria drafted by the European Union Eco-labelling Board, are to be established according to product groups.
(3) It also provides that the review of Eco-label criteria, as well as of the assessment and verification requirements related to those criteria, is to take place in due time before the end of the period of validity of the criteria specified for the product group concerned.
(4) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000, a timely review has been carried out of the ecological criteria, as well as of the related assessment and verification requirements established by Commission Decision 2002/255/EC of 25 March 2002 establishing the ecological criteria for the award of the Community Eco-label to televisions (2).
(5) In the light of this review, it is appropriate, in order to take account of scientific and market developments, to establish new ecological criteria.
(6) Furthermore, it is appropriate to modify the definition of the product group laid down in that Decision to take account of new technologies.
(7) In the interests of clarity, Decision 2002/255/EC should therefore be replaced. Since the period of validity of the ecological criteria set in that Decision has been prolonged until 31 October 2009, that Decision should be replaced as from 1 November 2009.
(8) The ecological criteria, as well as the related assessment and verification requirements, should be valid until 31 October 2013.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/245/EEC of 20 June 1972 relating to the radio interference (electromagnetic compatibility) of vehicles (2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 72/245/EEC is one of the separate directives under the type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC.
(2) In order to improve safety of vehicles by encouraging development and deployment of technologies utilising automotive short-range radar equipment, the Commission has harmonised the use of two radio spectrum frequency bands by Commission Decision 2004/545/EC of 8 July 2004 on the harmonisation of radio spectrum in the 79 GHz range for the use of automotive short-range radar equipment in the Community (3) and by Commission Decision 2005/50/EC of 17 January 2005 on the harmonisation of the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band for the time-limited use by automotive short-range radar equipment in the Community (4).
(3) In accordance with Decision 2005/50/EC, the use of 24 GHz automotive short-range radar equipment is time-limited and Member States have to set up a monitoring system aiming to quantify the number of vehicles equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment registered in their territory.
(4) Directive 72/245/EEC, as amended by Commission Directive 2005/49/EC (5), provided Member States with the appropriate means to carry out this monitoring. Directive 70/156/EEC was amended accordingly by that Directive.
(5) Since then it has become obvious that the way to provide these data can be simplified for 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and that it is unnecessary for monitoring purposes to require information about the use of 79 GHz short-radar equipment in the Certificate of Conformity (CoC) in addition to the information about the 24 GHz short range radar equipment, since the 79 GHz band does not interfere with other applications and its use is not restricted. It is therefore appropriate to modify requirements related to the use of 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and delete requirements related to the use of 79 GHz short-range radar equipment in Directive 72/245/EEC. This Directive does not affect the validity of existing approvals for vehicles not fitted with 24 GHz short range radars.
(6) Only Technical Services issue attestations according to the model given in Annex III C of Directive 72/245/EEC. No further authority or administration is involved in this process. Therefore, the additional stamping of the attestation presently required is dispensable and shall be removed.
(7) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Directive 70/156/EEC was amended accordingly by that Directive.\n\n((5)) Since then it has become obvious that the way to provide these data can be simplified for 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and that it is unnecessary for monitoring purposes to require information about the use of 79 GHz short-radar equipment in the Certificate of Conformity (CoC) in addition to the information about the 24 GHz short range radar equipment, since the 79 GHz band does not interfere with other applications and its use is not restricted. It is therefore appropriate to modify requirements related to the use of 24 GHz short-range radar equipment and delete requirements related to the use of 79 GHz short-range radar equipment in Directive 72/245/EEC. This Directive does not affect the validity of existing approvals for vehicles not fitted with 24 GHz short range radars.\n\n((6)) Only Technical Services issue attestations according to the model given in Annex III C of Directive 72/245/EEC. No further authority or administration is involved in this process. Therefore, the additional stamping of the attestation presently required is dispensable and shall be removed.\n\n((7)) Directive 72/245/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((8)) The amendments to Directive 72/245/EEC have an impact on Directive 70/156/EEC. It is therefore necessary to amend Directive 70/156/EEC accordingly.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress established by Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Amendment to Directive 72/245/EEC', 'text': 'Article 1\nAmendment to Directive 72/245/EEC\nDirective 72/245/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.\nIn Annex I, point 2.1.14 is deleted.\n2.\nAnnex II A is amended as follows:\n(a)\nPoint 12.7.1 is replaced by the following:\n‘12.7.1.\nvehicle equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment: Yes/No/Optional (strike out which is not applicable)’;\n(b)\nPoint 12.7.2 is deleted.\n3.\nThe appendix to Annex III A is amended as follows:\n(a)\nPoint 1.3.1 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.3.1.\nvehicle equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment: Yes/No/Optional (strike out which is not applicable)’;\n(b)\nPoint 1.3.2 is deleted.\n4.\nIn Annex III C, the words ‘Stamp of administration’ including the surrounding box are deleted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Amendment to Directive 70/156/EEC', 'text': 'Article 2\nAmendment to Directive 70/156/EEC\nDirective 70/156/EEC is amended as follows:\n1.\nAnnex I is amended as follows:\n(a)\nPoint 12.7.1 is replaced by the following:\n‘12.7.1.\nvehicle equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment: Yes/No/Optional (strike out which is not applicable)’;\n(b)\nPoint 12.7.2 is deleted.\n2.\nAnnex III, Part I, Section A is amended as follows:\n(a)\nPoint 12.7.1 is replaced by the following:\n‘12.7.1.\nvehicle equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment: Yes/No/Optional (strike out which is not applicable)’;\n(b)\nPoint 12.7.2 is deleted.\n3.\nAnnex IX, on side two of all models of the Certificate of Conformity (COC), is amended as follows:\n(a)\nPoint 50 is replaced by the following and a footnote is added as follows:\n‘50.\nRemarks\n(\n6\n)\n:\n(\n6\n)\nIf the vehicle is equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment according to Decision 2005/50/EC, the manufacturer must indicate here: “Vehicle equipped with 24 GHz short-range radar equipment”.’\n                                                ""\n(b)\nPoints 50.1, 50.2 and 50.3 are deleted.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Transposition', 'text': 'Article 3\nTransposition\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 30 June 2006 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 57 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the co-ordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance (3), to facilitate the taking up and pursuit of the said business, has eliminated certain divergencies between national legislations ; whereas it has ensured adequate protection for insured and third parties in all the Member States and, at the same time, co-ordinated in particular the provisions relating to the financial guarantees required of insurance undertakings;
Whereas, pursuant to that Directive, the minimum guarantee fund which each Member State requires of all insurance undertakings with head offices in its territory may not be less than certain amounts which are expressed in units of account in the Directive;
Whereas the unit of account is also referred to in order to determine the amount of the contribution revenue of certain mutual associations below which the Directive does not apply;
Whereas, for the purposes of the said Directive ""unit of account"" means that unit which is defined in Article 4 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European Investment Bank ; whereas on the basis of this definition the conversion of the amounts mentioned in the Directive into national currencies would lead to distortions of competition between undertakings whose head offices are situated in the various Member States;
Whereas by Decision 75/250/EEC (4) the Council defined on 21 April 1975 a European unit of account representing the average of any changes in the value of the currencies of the Member States ; whereas the conversion rate for each currency against this unit of account is fixed automatically by reference to daily quotations on the exchange markets ; whereas the use of this European unit of account places insurance undertakings on the same competitive footing;  (1)OJ No C 28, 9.2.1976, p. 16. (2)OJ No C 35, 16.2.1976, p. 17. (3)OJ No L 228, 16.8.1973, p. 3. (4)OJ No L 104, 24.4.1975, p. 35.
Whereas Article 4 of the aforesaid Protocol is undergoing revision ; whereas, pursuant to the Decision of 18 March 1975 of the Board of Governors of the EIB, the Bank uses the European unit of account defined by Council Decision 75/250/EEC;
Whereas more recently, on 18 December 1975, the Commission, by Decision No 3289/75/ECSC (1), adopted, with the unanimous assent of the Council, this European unit of account in applying the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community;
Whereas the value of the European unit of account in each of the Member States' currencies is fixed daily and whereas a reference day must also be fixed for its use when applying this Directive;
Whereas, however, in certain Member States the introduction of the European unit of account would lead to a reduction in terms of national currency of the amounts expressed in units of account in the Directive ; whereas such a reduction would lead to a corresponding reduction in the protection now given to insured parties by the minimum guarantee fund ; whereas the said amounts should be reviewed every two years ; whereas, as a result of this review, the amounts in question are likely to be amended ; whereas in certain Member States the reduction in the amounts expressed in national currency could, under these conditions, be swiftly followed by a further adjustment in those States ; whereas the implementation of these successive measures would raise difficulties for undertakings and supervisory authorities ; whereas, therefore, these amounts should be kept at the level which they would have reached on the basis of the conversion rate applicable before the introduction of the European unit of account, if this level is higher than that of the European unit of account, until the amounts fixed in Directive 73/239/EEC are reviewed;
Whereas changes in the economic and monetary situation of the Community justify the examination at regular intervals of the latter amounts,","{'title': 'Council Directive 76/580/EEC of 29 June 1976 amending Directive 73/239/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 15 September 1986
on specific training in general medical practice
(86/457/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49, 57 and 66 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Council Directive 75/362/EEC (4), as last amended by the 1985 Act of Accession, and Council Directive 75/363/EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 82/76/EEC (6), on freedom of movement for medical practitioners, contain no provisions regarding the mutual recognition of diplomas attesting to specific training in general medical practice or the criteria to which such training should conform;
Whereas, although the Council did not consider that the time was right to take appropriate measures on the matter at Community level, it nevertheless noted that in a number of Member States there was a growing tendency to emphasize the general medical practitioner's role and the importance of his training; whereas it accordingly requested the Commission to study the problems connected with this development;
Whereas the point has now been reached where it is almost universally recognized that there is a need for specific training for the general medical practitioner to enable him better to fulfil his function; whereas this function, which depends to a great extent on the doctor's personal knowledge of his patients' environment, consists of giving advice on the prevention of illness and on the protection of the patient's general health, besides giving appropriate treatment;
Whereas this need for specific training in general medical practice has emerged mainly as a result of the development of medical science, which has increasingly widened the gap between medical research and teaching on the one hand and general medical practice on the other, so that important aspects of general medical practice can no longer be taught in a satisfactory manner within the framework of the Member States' current basic medical training;
Whereas, apart from the benefit to patients, it is also recognized that improved training for the specific function of general medical practitioner would contribute to an improvement in health care, particularly by developing a more selective approach to the consultation of specialists, use of laboratories and other highly specialized establishments and equipment;
Whereas improved training for general medical practice will upgrade the status of the general medical practitioner;
Whereas, although this situation seems irreversible, it has developed at different rates in the various Member States; whereas it is desirable to ensure that the various trends converge in successive stages, without however forcing the pace, with a view to appropriate training for every general medical practitioner in order to satisfy the specific requirements of general medical practice;
Whereas, to ensure the gradual introduction of this reform, it is necessary in an initial stage to institute in each Member State specific training in general medical practice which satisfies minimum quality and quantity requirements, and supplements the minimum basic training which medical practitioners must receive in accordance with Directive 75/363/EEC; whereas it is immaterial whether this training in general medical practice is received as part of, or separately from, basic medical training as laid down nationally; whereas, in a second stage, provision should be made to subject the exercise of general medical practice under a social security scheme to completion of specific training in general medical practice; whereas further proposals to complete the reform should subsequently be put forward;
Whereas this Directive does not affect the power of the Member States to organize their national social security schemes and to determine what activities are to be carried out under those schemes;
Whereas the coordination, pursuant to this Directive, of the minimum conditions governing the issue of diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications certifying completion of specific training in general medical practice will render possible the mutual recognition of these diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications by the Member States;
Whereas, under Directive 75/362/EEC, a host Member State is not entitled to require medical practitioners, in possession of diplomas obtained in another Member State and recognized under that Directive, to complete any additional training in order to practise within its social security scheme, even where such training is required of holders of diplomas of medicine obtained in its own territory; whereas this consequence of Directive 75/362/EEC will remain in effect as regards the exercise of general medical practice under social security schemes until 1 January 1995, from which date the present Directive requires all Member States to make the exercise of general medical practice in the context of their social security schemes subject to the possession of specific training in general medical practice; whereas medical practitioners established in practice before that date under Directive 75/362/EEC must have an acquired right to practise as general medical practitioners under the national social security scheme of the host country even if they have not completed specific training in general medical practice,","{'title': 'Council Directive 86/457/EEC of 15 September 1986 on specific training in general medical practice', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nEach Member State which dispenses the complete training referred to in Article 1 of Directive 75/363/EEC within its territory shall institute specific training in general medical practice meeting requirements at least as stringent as those laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of this Directive, in such a manner that the first diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of the course are issued not later than 1 January 1990.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 26 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 with a view to modify certain concessions for rice. Accordingly, the Community notified the WTO on 2 July 2003 of its intention to modify certain concessions in EC Schedule CXL.
(2) Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by Article 133 of the Treaty and within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council.
(3) The Commission has negotiated with the United States of America, having a principal supplying interest in products of HS subheading 1006 20 (husked rice) and substantial supplier interest in products of HS subheading 1006 30 (milled rice), Thailand, having a principal supplying interest in products of HS subheading 1006 30 (milled rice) and substantial supplier interest in products of HS subheading 1006 20 (husked rice) and India and Pakistan, each having a substantial supplier interest in products of HS subheading 1006 20 (husked rice).
(4) The Commission has negotiated an agreement with India and Pakistan in the form of an exchange of letters but has not been able to negotiate an acceptable agreement with the United States of America and Thailand.
(5) In order to allow the modifications of certain concessions concerning husked and milled rice in EC Schedule CXL, a new tariff rate for husked and milled rice should be established.
(6) As the fixing of a new tariff rate for husked and milled rice requires modification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (1), the Commission should be authorised to adopt temporary derogations from that Regulation.

Whereas the amount of the aid referred to above for the supply to the FOD of male animals and of breeding animals originating in the rest of the Community should be laid down; whereas, in the case of male animals, this aid should be fixed so that the  conditions of supply for deliveries within the Community may be equivalent to those for deliveries from the world market; whereas, in the case of pure-bred breeding animals, this aid is to be laid down with regard to the criteria in Article 4 (3) of  Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91;

Whereas eligibility for the specific measures for supply for fattening in the FOD assumes the that the animals in question are fattened and consumed on the spot; whereas appropriate securities and checks should be instituted to ensure compliance with  these conditions;
Whereas, for the purposes of the sound administrative management of the supply arrangements, a time limit for submitting applications for licences and certificates and a perid of reflection before they are issued should be laid down;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances listed in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 of 27 June 2007 on laying down the procedure of the renewal of the inclusion of a first group of active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and establishing the list of those substances (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. Imazalil is listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 737/2007.
(2) The approval of imazalil, as set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (4), expires on 31 December 2011. A notification was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 for the renewal of the inclusion of imazalil in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within the time period provided for in that Article.
(3) That notification was found to be admissible by Commission Decision 2008/656/EC of 28 July 2008 on the admissibility of the notifications concerning the renewal of the inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances azimsulfuron, azoxystrobin, fluroxypyr, imazalil, kresoxim-methyl, prohexadione and spiroxamine, and establishing the list of the notifiers concerned (5).
(4) Within the time period provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007, the notifier submitted the data required in accordance with that Article together with an explanation as regards the relevance of each new study submitted.
(5) The rapporteur Member State prepared an assessment report in consultation with the co-rapporteur Member State and submitted it to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and the Commission on 9 June 2009. In addition to the assessment of the active substance, that report includes a list of the studies the rapporteur Member State relied on for its assessment.
(6) The Authority communicated the assessment report to the notifier and to the Member States for comments and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the assessment report available to the public.
(7) At the request of the Commission, the assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority. The Authority presented its conclusion on the peer review of the risk assessment of imazalil (6) to the Commission on 4 March 2010. The assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for imazalil.
(8) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing imazalil may be expected to continue to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve imazalil.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions not provided for in the first inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) Based on the review report which supports a lower level of purity compared to that set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, and taking into account that no toxicologically or ecotoxicologically significant impurities are present, the purity level should be modified.
(11) From the new data submitted, it appears that imazalil and its degradation products in soil and surface water systems may cause risks for soil micro-organisms and aquatic organisms; negligible groundwater exposure needs to be confirmed; further investigation is needed on the nature of residues in processed commodities. Without prejudice to the conclusion that imazalil should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(12) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(13) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing imazalil. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(14) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (7) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(15) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should be amended accordingly.
(16) In the interest of clarity, Commission Directive 2010/57/EU of 26 August 2010 amending Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC to renew the inclusion of imazalil as active substance (8) should be repealed.

A notification was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 for the renewal of the inclusion of imazalil in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within the time period provided for in that Article.\n\n((3)) That notification was found to be admissible by Commission Decision 2008/656/EC of 28 July 2008 on the admissibility of the notifications concerning the renewal of the inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances azimsulfuron, azoxystrobin, fluroxypyr, imazalil, kresoxim-methyl, prohexadione and spiroxamine, and establishing the list of the notifiers concerned(5).\n\n((4)) Within the time period provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007, the notifier submitted the data required in accordance with that Article together with an explanation as regards the relevance of each new study submitted.\n\n((5)) The rapporteur Member State prepared an assessment report in consultation with the co-rapporteur Member State and submitted it to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and the Commission on 9 June 2009. In addition to the assessment of the active substance, that report includes a list of the studies the rapporteur Member State relied on for its assessment.\n\n((6)) The Authority communicated the assessment report to the notifier and to the Member States for comments and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the assessment report available to the public.\n\n((7)) At the request of the Commission, the assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority. The Authority presented its conclusion on the peer review of the risk assessment of imazalil(6)to the Commission on 4 March 2010. The assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for imazalil.\n\n((8)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing imazalil may be expected to continue to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve imazalil.\n\n((9)) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions not provided for in the first inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((10)) Based on the review report which supports a lower level of purity compared to that set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, and taking into account that no toxicologically or ecotoxicologically significant impurities are present, the purity level should be modified.\n\n((11)) From the new data submitted, it appears that imazalil and its degradation products in soil and surface water systems may cause risks for soil micro-organisms and aquatic organisms; negligible groundwater exposure needs to be confirmed; further investigation is needed on the nature of residues in processed commodities. Without prejudice to the conclusion that imazalil should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n\n((12)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n\n((13)) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing imazalil. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((14)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((15)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should be amended accordingly.\n\n((16)) In the interest of clarity, Commission Directive 2010/57/EU of 26 August 2010 amending Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC to renew the inclusion of imazalil as active substance(8)should be repealed.\n\n((17)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nApproval of active substance\nThe active substance imazalil, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Re-evaluation of plant protection products', 'text': 'Article 2\nRe-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing imazalil as an active substance by 30 June 2012.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in Part B of the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing imazalil as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 31 December 2011 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account Part B of the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 122(2), thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the report from the Commission(2),
Having regard to the report from the European Central Bank(3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Having regard to the discussion of the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government,
Whereas:
(1) The third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) started on 1 January 1999. The Council, meeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or Government, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 1999(4).
(2) In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty, the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.
(3) By virtue of Decision 1998/317/EC Greece and Sweden have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.
(4) The European Central Bank (ECB) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union of 16 June 1997(5). The procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 1 September 1998 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union(6).
(5) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB shall report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. Such reports have to be prepared in 2000. On 9 March 2000 Greece made such a request.
(6) National legislation in the Member States including the statutes of national central banks shall as necessary be adapted with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Greece and Sweden with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
(7) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121 (1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability inflation will be measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95(7). In order to assess the price stability criterion a Member State's inflation has been measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one year period ending in March 2000 the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability were France, Austria and Sweden, with inflation rates of, respectively 0,9 %, 0,9 % and 0,8 %. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one year period ending in March 2000 was 2,4 %.
(8) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty shall mean that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.
(9) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the criterion on participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate against any other Member State's currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II provides the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending in March 2000.
(10) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest-rate criterion a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one year period ending in March 2000 was 7,2 %.
(11) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria will be provided by the Commission. For the preparation of this proposal the Commission provided data. Budgetary data were provided by the Commission after reporting by the Member States by 1 March 2000 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(8).
(12) The Greek domestic legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
Regarding the fulfilment by Greece of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 121(1) of the Treaty:
- the average inflation rate in Greece in the year ending March 2000 stood at 2,0 % which is below the reference value,
- by virtue of Council Decision 2000/33/EC of 17 December 1999 abrogating the Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece(9), Greece is not the subject of a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive government deficit,
- Greece has been a member of the ERM and subsequently of ERM II during the last two years. In that period the Greek drachma (GRD) has not been subject to severe tensions and Greece has not devalued, on its own initiative, the GRD bilateral central rate against any other Member State's currency up to 1 January 1999 nor against the euro since then,
- in the year ending March 2000 the long-term interest rate in Greece was, on average, 6,4 % which is below the reference value.
Greece has achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to all four criteria.
Consequently, Greece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency.
(13) The Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal by the Commission, shall decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,","{'title': '2000/427/EC: Council Decision of 19 June 2000 in accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Greece of the single currency on 1 January 2001', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nGreece fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.

THE COMMISSION  OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments in accordance with Article 93,
Whereas:
I
On 31 October 1989, pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty and in accordance with the requirements of the Community rules on man-made fibres, the German authorities notified a plan to grant aid in the form of a grant and two soft loans for  investments to be made by Deggendorf in the period 1987 to 1989.
Further information concerning the recipient and the aids was supplied on 9 March 1990 at the request of the Commission.
The notification concerned a proposal to grant aid in different forms for investment totalling DM 45,2 million in the production of stockings and intermediate products (DM 24 million) and the preparation of combined (polyurethane and polyamide) elastic  threads (DM 21,2 million).
The aid consists of a 10 % grant (DM 4,52 million)
on the basis of the Investment Allowance Law (Investitionszulagengesetz) approved by the Commission by letter of 7 December 1987. At the same time, two loans amounting to DM 6 million and DM 14 million are to be granted from the budget of the Free State  of Bavaria under
the Bavarian regional assistance programme (Bayerisches regionales Foerderprogramm) approved by the Commission by letter dated 27 December 1988; the loans are to be for 12 and eight years respectively, with a two-year grace period, at a 5 % interest  rate.
Taking into account the total amount of the investments, the net grant equivalent of the different aids is about 12,6 %.
Aid to the synthetic fibres industry is subject to a sectoral code on State aids, introduced in 1977, renewed every two years since then and most recently in 1989 (communication to the Member States of 6 July 1989). The main products
manufactured by Deggendorf GmbH, i.e. polyamide and polyester yarns, are covered by the code which requires that all aid proposals, of whatever type, in favour of companies in the synthetic fibre and yarn sector must be notified to the Commission in  sufficient time for it to submit its comments and, if necessary, initiate in respect of the proposed measures the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty.
The same code reduces the range of the acceptable exceptions to the general restrictions on State aids to the sole case of incentives for disinvestments from the sector towards other productions, while it takes a generally unfavourable view of all  measures which have the effect of increasing the net production capacity of companies in the synthetic fibres sector.
On the basis of the information supplied by the German authorities, the Commission considered that although none of the products concerned by the investments was covered directly by the present code on man-made fibres, which concerns the manufacturing  of upstream components (polyamide yarns), there was a risk of an indirect effect on the company's overall financial position.
Furthermore, it was not possible, on the basis of the information then available, to determine whether or not a clear and total distinction could be made between the synthetic fibre and the new investment.
The Commission also took account of the fact that on 21 March 1986 it took a negative Decision in respect of incompatible aids granted to the same company between 1981 and 1983. This Decision (86/509/EEC) (1) required the recovery of a DM 6,12 million  grant and DM 11 million soft loan. These aids have not yet been repaid and Deggendorf is therefore still benefiting from incompatible aid which artificially improves its competitiveness.
Finally, the Commission considered that in a Community market for polyamide and polyester yarns which is highly competitive due to the presence of several producers operating in all the national markets and which is characterized by stagnant demand,  capital intensive investments and reduced margins, the aids in question were liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States and were therefore incompatible with the
common market within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty.
Furthermore, the Commission took the view that the aids did not meet the conditions which must be fulfilled for one of the exceptions laid down in Article 92 to apply and it therefore initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of
Article 93
(2) of the EEC Treaty.
By letter of 10 May 1990, it gave the German Goverment notice to submit its comments. The other Member States and interested parties were informed through the publication of the notice to the German Government in the Official Journal of the European  Communities (2).
II
The German Goverment, in submitting its comments under the Article 93 (2) procedure by letter of 28 June 1990, confirmed the position taken in the notification, namely, that the production affected by the investments, i.e. hosiery knitting and  manufacturing, as well as the covering of yarns, was a completely different operation from the production of fibres.
As regards the possibility that the aid in question could indirectly have a positive effect on the company's financial position, the German authorities considered the risk to be only minor.
A federation of firms in the sector submitted its comments under the procedure.
The comments were forwarded on 18 October 1990 to the German authorities, from whom no further comments were received.
III
The financial assistance granted to Deggendorf GmbH under the Investment Allowance Law approved by the Commission by letter of 7 December 1987, and under the Bavarian regional aid programme approved by letter dated 27 December 1988, is aid within the  meaning of Article 92 (1) because it enables the undertaking to carry out investments without having to bear all the costs thereof.
Such aid must be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 93 (3) because under the synthetic fibre and yarn aid code the Commission requires prior notification of all aid proposals, of whatever type, in favour of companies in the synthetic fibre  and yarn sector.
IV
The Community's code on synthetic fibres concerns all companies operating in that sector which receive public
support under any scheme for whatever purpose, but it aims to prevent aid only when the aid entails increases in the specific production capacities for fibres and yarns.
In the present case, the Commission determined that there was no direct technical link between the production of yarns (which is covered by the code) and that of stockings and elastane threads resulting from the aided investment. On the contrary, the  Commission considers that the additional processing capacity of these 'downstream' products will constitute a further outlet for the production of yarns, thus easing the general oversupply in the sector.
The aid to Deggendorf will be granted under two regional aid schemes approved by the Commission as stated above in order to facilitate the development of certain areas of the Community. The aid measures will fulfil the conditions and aims of the schemes  by increasing employment in the area by some 140 new full-time jobs; consequently, they are eligible for exemption pursuant to Article 92 (3) (c).
V
When deciding whether one of the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty can apply to an aid, the Commission must take into account all relevant circumstances which may influence the effect of the aid on trading conditions in the  Community.
As stated in points II and III of this Decision, the Commission took a negative decision on 21 May 1986 in respect of illegal aids granted to the same company between 1981 and 1983 requiring the recovery of DM 6,12 million in grants and DM 11 million in  soft loans. The negative decision was not contested in the Court of Justice and has therefore become final in law.
In an almost identical case concerning aid to another German synthetic fibre producer (Deufil), the latter did challenge the Commission's decision before the Court of Justice (Case 310/85). The Court ruled in favour of the Commission and dismissed the  company's claim that it was entitled to keep the aid on the ground of legitimate expectation (3).
Despite the Commission's negative decision, and the Court ruling in an almost identical case, Deggendorf has still not repaid the aid.
It should be noted that Deggendorf could not under any circumstances lay claim to legitimate expectation in view of the fact that the Commission, in its decision to initiate the procedure in 1985, had expressly warned it of the uncertain status of aid  granted illegally.
It should also be pointed out that, as the Court of Justice has consistently upheld, most recently in its BUG-Alutechnik judgment (4), the recovery of aid granted illegally should in principle comply with the relevant provisions of national law  provided, however, that the provisions are not applied in such a way as to make it impossible in practice to recover the aid in accordance with Community law. Although in the case in point, the German authorities have taken legal action in the national  courts to recover the aid, the aid has not actually been repaid.
The cumulative effect of the illegal aid which Deggendorf has been refusing to repay since 1986 and the present new investment aid would give it an excessive and undue advantage which would adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to  the common interest.
The undue advantage enjoyed by Deggendorf until it repays the incompatible aid illegally granted between 1981 and 1983 enables it to benefit from an aid intensity of 29 % net grant equivalent in respect of the investment in question. The intensity would  be considerably higher if the interest payments due on the sums owed were to be added.
As a result, Deggendorf has benefited from unjustified enrichment and will continue to do so until the aid granted illegally is actually repaid.
Consequently, even if the present planned aid of DM 13,41 million may be regarded as compatible with the common market, the Commission considers that it should not be paid until the incompatible aid referred to in its 1986 Decision has been repaid. This  situation stems from the negligent behaviour of the German Government and of Deggendorf, both of which have infringed the mandatory rules of Article 93 (3).
Furthermore, the Commission does not have the power to enforce the speeding-up or implementation of its 1986 Decision, which makes it all the more necessary to suspend payment of the aid in question.
It should also be noted that, in its notice pursuant to Article 93 (2), the Commission referred to the doubly distorting effect on competition caused by the failure of Deggendorf to repay the earlier incompatible aids. Yet neither the German Government  nor the company in question have submitted any arguments or comments on this matter.
To conclude, the aid totalling DM 13,41 million which the German Government plans to grant to Deggendorf is compatible with the common market but may not be granted until Deggendorf has repaid the aid received illegally between 1981 and 1983 referred to  in Commission Decision 86/509/EEC,","{'title': '91/391/EEC: Commission Decision of 26 March 1991 on aid granted by the German Government to Deggendorf GmbH, a producer of polyamide and polyester yarns located in Deggendorf (Bavaria) (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '93', 'title': 'Article 93', 'text': ""Article 93\n\n(2) of the EEC Treaty.\n\nBy letter of 10 May 1990, it gave the German Goverment notice to submit its comments.

Whereas:
(1) Following a Community veterinary mission, it appears that the animal health situation in New Caledonia compares favourably with that in Member States particularly as regards diseases transmissible through meat.
(2) In addition, the competent veterinary authorities of New Caledonia have confirmed that the islands have, for at least 12 months, been free from foot-and-mouth disease and rinderpest, and that vaccinations against the above diseases have not taken place for at least 12 months.
(3) The competent authorities of New Caledonia have undertaken to notify the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours, by fax, telex or telegram of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of the abovementioned diseases, or of any alteration in the vaccination policy against them.
(4) Other health conditions must be established for meat not intended for human consumption in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 92/118/EEC(3) and Commission Decision 89/18/EEC(4).
(5) The importation of fresh meat of bovine animals originating from that country should therefore be authorised.
(6) Council Directive 96/93/EC(5) lays down standards of certification which are necessary for valid certification and to prevent fraud. It is appropriate to ensure that the rules and principles applied by third-country certifying officers provide guarantees which are at least equivalent to those laid down in this Directive.
(7) Animal health conditions and veterinary certification must be adapted according to the animal health conditions of the third country concerned. It is therefore appropriate to provide for a model certificate with regard to fresh meat of bovine animals only.
(8) Council Directive 93/119/EC(6) requires that the veterinary health certificate accompanying meat to be imported from third countries to the European Community must be supplemented by an attestation certifying that the animals have been slaughtered under conditions which offer guarantees of humane treatment at least equivalent to the relevant provisions in that Directive.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 338(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) As a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), powers conferred on the Commission should be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU.
(2) In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions.
(4) In order to align Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU, implementing powers conferred on the Commission by that Regulation should be replaced by powers to adopt delegated and implementing acts.
(5) In order to provide a satisfactory response to users’ needs for statistical information without imposing excessive burdens on economic operators, to take into account changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of different or specific rules applying to specific goods or movements, the adaptation of the Intrastat coverage rates, the specification of the conditions for defining the thresholds referred to in Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004, the specification of the conditions for simplifying the information to be provided for small individual transactions and the definition of the aggregated data.
(6) When adopting delegated acts, it is particularly important for the Commission to carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. When preparing and drawing up delegated acts, the Commission should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council. The Commission should also ensure that the delegated acts provided for in the legislative acts do not impose a significant additional burden on the Member States or on the respondents and that they remain as economical as possible.
(7) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission enabling it to adopt the arrangements for collecting information, particularly concerning the codes to be used, the determination of the breakdown of the estimates, technical provisions for compiling annual statistics on trade by business characteristics and any measures necessary to ensure that the quality of the statistics transmitted meets the quality standards. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011.
(8) The Committee for the statistics on the trading of goods between Member States (the ‘Intrastat Committee’) referred to in Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 provides advice to the Commission and assists it in exercising its implementing powers.
(9) Under the strategy for a new European Statistical System (ESS) structure intended to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC), established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), should have an advisory role and should assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers. Improving coordination between national authorities and the Commission (Eurostat) is key to producing higher quality statistics in the Union.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 should be amended by replacing the reference to the Intrastat Committee with a reference to the ESSC.
(11) Simplifications of customs clearance schemes have led to the non-availability, at customs level, of statistical information about goods under customs processing procedures. To assure coverage of the data, movements of those goods should be included in the Intrastat system.
(12) The exchange of confidential data relating to intra-Union trade statistics should be allowed between Member States with a view to increasing the efficiency of the development, production and dissemination or to improving the quality of those statistics. Such exchanges of confidential data should be voluntary, be treated carefully and not per se entail an increased administrative burden on undertakings.
(13) The definition of statistical value should be clarified and aligned with the definition of that data element under the extra-Union trade statistics in order to enable better comparability between intra-Union and extra-Union trade statistics. Uniform definitions are essential for the harmonised recording of cross-border trade and are especially important as a prerequisite to enable national authorities to make concordant interpretations of rules having an impact on the cross-border activities of businesses.
(14) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate to lay down harmonised rules on the communication of information by the customs administration, the exchange of confidential data between Member States and the definition of statistical value in the domain of intra-Union trade statistics. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective, in accordance with Article 5(4) of the Treaty on European Union.
(15) Data transmission by the national authorities should be free of charge for the Member States and for the Union institutions and agencies.
(16) It is important to guarantee the security of the modes of transmission of sensitive statistical data, including economic data.
(17) To ensure legal certainty, procedures for the adoption of measures which have been initiated but not completed before the entry into force of this Regulation should not be affected by this Regulation.
(18) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '27.6.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 189/128', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 659/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 May 2014\namending Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 on Community statistics relating to trading of goods between Member States as regards conferring delegated and implementing powers on the Commission for the adoption of certain measures, the communication of information by the customs administration, the exchange of confidential data between Member States and the definition of statistical value', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) As a consequence of the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), powers conferred on the Commission should be aligned with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU.\n\n((2)) In connection with the adoption of Regulation (EU) No\xa0182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), the Commission has committed itself to reviewing, in the light of the criteria laid down in the TFEU, legislative acts which currently contain references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny.\n\n((3)) Regulation (EC) No\xa0638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions.\n\n((4)) In order to align Regulation (EC) No\xa0638/2004 with Articles 290 and 291 TFEU, implementing powers conferred on the Commission by that Regulation should be replaced by powers to adopt delegated and implementing acts.\n\n((5)) In order to provide a satisfactory response to users’ needs for statistical information without imposing excessive burdens on economic operators, to take into account changes necessary for methodological reasons and the necessity to set up an efficient system for the collection of data and the compilation of statistics, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the adoption of different or specific rules applying to specific goods or movements, the adaptation of the Intrastat coverage rates, the specification of the conditions for defining the thresholds referred to in Article 10(4) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0638/2004, the specification of the conditions for simplifying the information to be provided for small individual transactions and the definition of the aggregated data.\n\n((6)) When adopting delegated acts, it is particularly important for the Commission to carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE
of 4 December 1989
on the limitation of noise emission from civil subsonic jet aeroplanes
(89/629/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the application of noise emission standards to civil subsonic jet aeroplanes has significant consequences for the provision of air transport services, in particular where such standards impose restrictions on the type of aeroplanes that may be operated by airlines, encourage investment in the latest and quietest aeroplanes available and facilitate the better use of existing capacity, including that of airports; whereas Directive 80/51/EEC (4), as amended by Directive 83/206/EEC (5) fixes limits on the emission of such noise;
Whereas the priority programme of the Council for the study of air transport questions refers to emission from aeroplanes including noise;
Whereas the programme of action of the European Communities on the environment (6) shows clearly the importance of the problem of noise and, in particular, the need to take action against noise due to air traffic;
Whereas aeroplane noise should be further reduced, taking into account environmental factors, technical feasibility and economic consequences;
Whereas, therefore, it is appropriate to restrict the addition of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes to Member States' registers to those which comply with the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 3, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, 2nd edition, 1988; whereas in conjunction with the creation of an area without internal frontiers, it would be reasonable to exclude from this non-addition rule aeroplanes entered in Member States' national registers on 1 November 1990; whereas, due to the freedom of movement such a rule would allow, it is essential that exemptions be limited and that those granted be closely monitored and restricted in time;
Whereas common rules for this purpose should be introduced on a reasonable time-scale to ensure a harmonized approach throughout the Community supplementing existing rules; whereas this is particularly important in view of the recent impetus given to liberalization of European air traffic;
Whereas the work undertaken by the Community in cooperation with other international bodies has indicated that limiting the addition to Member States' registers of aeroplanes which are unable to meet the noise certification standards specified in Chapter 3 of the abovementioned Annex 16, would in itself be of limited environmental benefit, and should therefore be considered only as a first stage, to be followed by measures to limit the operation of aeroplanes which do not comply with the standards of Chapter 3 of the said Annex 16,","{'title': 'Council Directive 89/629/EEC of 4 December 1989 on the limitation of noise emission from civil subsonic jet aeroplanes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1), and in particular Article 142(c) thereof,

(1) Article 69(4) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 limits the resources that can be used for any coupled measure provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of that Regulation to 3,5 % of the national ceiling referred to in Article 40 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. For the sake of clarity, the Commission should publish the ceiling resulting from the amounts notified by the Member States for the measures concerned.
(2) The budgetary ceilings for the support provided for in Article 68(1)(a)(i) to (iv) and Article 68(1)(b) and (e) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for calendar year 2012 are set out in Annex III to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 564/2012 (2).
(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1270/2012 (3) provides certain derogations for Portugal as regards the deadline for reviewing its decision on specific support for 2012, as regards the deadline for notification of such review, as regards the conditions applicable to specific agricultural activities entailing additional agri-environment benefits and as regards the information contained in the aid application.
(4) On 4 January 2013, Portugal has informed the Commission of the amended support measures which it intends to apply for 2012.
(5) According to the information submitted, Portugal intends:
— to amend the current support measure under Article 68(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in the dairy sector by increasing the envelope allocated to that measure from EUR 8,8 million to EUR 10,32 million in 2012,
— to amend the current support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 by restricting its scope to bovine females of the ‘Brava de Lide’ breed reducing the respective envelope by EUR 2,53 million,
— to introduce a new support measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for the maintaining of certain autochthonous breeds of beef (‘Alentejana’, ‘Mertolenga’), sheep (‘Serra de Estrela’, ‘Churra de Terra Quente’) and goat (‘Serrana’), with a total allocated envelope of EUR 1,68 million, and
— to reduce the envelope of a measure under Article 68(l)(a)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 for extensive pasturing by EUR 0,67 million.

Whereas young workers should be offered greater opportunities to broaden their vocational training and their cultural, linguistic and human knowledge in a Member State other than that in which they reside;
Whereas the exchange of young workers should be developed alongside measures taken to promote youth employment, while at the same time retaining its individual character by its objectives and the nature of the operations involved;
Whereas the experience gained in the implementation of the second joint programme to encourage the exchange of young workers within the Community (3) proved positive and consequently the underlying principles should be reaffirmed in the context of a third programme;
Whereas, in view of the present employment situation, the exchange programme should be extended to young job-seekers;
Whereas, in addition to training periods of long duration of a predominantly vocational nature, provision should continue to be made and extended for study training periods of short duration which offer young workers the opportunity of establishing close contact with the working and living environment of the host country;
Whereas the Community institutions must make a substantial contribution to the implementation of the third joint programme;
Whereas the participation of bodies or groups operating at European level which, by virtue of their structure, type of activities and operational capacities, are able to make an effective contribution to implementing the programme should be ensured;
Whereas the establishment of a third joint programme to encourage the exchange of young workers within the Community appears necessary to attain one of the objectives of the Community;

CONCLUDING DOCUMENT OF THE INAUGURAL CONFERENCE FOR A PACT ON STABILITY IN EUROPE   Part 1: Aims and principles of the inaugural conference for a Pact on Stability in Europe  1.1. We, Ministers for Foreign Affairs and representantives of States participating in the Conference, have decided to meet in Paris in response to the European  Union's call for the conclusion of a Pact on Stability in Europe.\n\n1.2. We are today at a turning point in the history of the European continent. Considerable progress has been made along the road to democracy, peace and the unity of Europe. The Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris, the Copenhagen Document, the  Helsinki 1992 Document, as well as bilateral agreements on good neighbourly relations, are milestones in this process. But we must go further and make these achievements irreversible.\n\n1.3. We believe that the time has come to provide a new impetus to overcoming any remaining divisive tendencies which history has bequeathed to the European continent by means of preventive measures, and we affirm our will to create a climate of  confidence which will be favourable to the strengthening of democracy, to respect for human rights and to economic progress and peace, while at the same time respecting the identities of peoples.\n\n1.4. We welcome the efforts deployed for that aim in fora such as the CSCE and the Council of Europe. We note the prospects of accession to the European Union which were offered by the Copenhagen European Council to the associated countries of central  and eastern Europe which desire it and the steps of the countries which are drawing closer to the European Union with accession as their goal: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. With this  perspective in mind, we have decided to hold a conference on Stability in Europe, which following a consultation and negotiation process organized within its framework, should lead to the adoption of a Pact on Stability.\n\n1.5. The objectives of stability will be achieved through the promotion of good neighbourly relations, including questions related to frontiers and minorities, as well as regional cooperation and the strengthening of democratic institutions through  cooperation arrangements to be established in the different fields that can contribute to the objective.\n\n1.6. We agree that the reference principles of the Pact on stability, concerning good neighbourly relations, will be the existing principles and commitments established by the UN, the CSCE and the Council of Europe, in particular those principles  contained in the Helsinki Final Act, in the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, in the Copenhagen document, in the Helsinki 1992 Document and the 1993 Vienna Declaration of the Council of Europe Summit, referring respectively, to inviolability of  frontiers, territorial integrity and respect of existing borders, and to national minorities.\n\n1.7. We have decided as our method to proceed in a pragmatic manner. The discussions in progress on the various draft agreements and arrangements could also be facilitated by including them in the Pact process. Our aim is to encourage countries which  have not yet concluded cooperation and good neighbourliness agreements and arrangements, including minority and border issues, to do so, through a process of bilateral negotiation and regional tables, the composition and agenda for which will have been  freely chosen by the participating countries.\n\n1.8. All the agreements and arrangements reached, will be included in the Pact on Stability, to the content of which all the countries concluding the Pact will be committed to giving their full political support. Countries which have already concluded  bilateral agreements with their neighbours may also, if they wish, have these agreements included in the Pact. It will become for all those countries which conclude it an essential reference point to give a new quality founded on the respect for  differences and shared values to relations between the peoples of the whole of Europe.\n\n1.9. We hope that our continent, which has for so long been torn by war, will become an example of accepted diversity for the international community.\n\nPart 2: Operational decisions  2.1. In this spirit our countries have held intensive consultations over the last few months to decide on the problems to be dealt with, the procedures and the timetable to be observed to achieve the goals set. Those  consultations have enabled us to agree on the way forward. They bear testimony to the constructive spirit and will to cooperate actively and to succeed which animate our countries.\n\n2.2. Against this background, we note the willingness of the States referred to in point 1.4 to further develop their relations in the spirit of good-neighbourly relations, according to treaties and agreements already concluded, to continue or launch  bilateral negotiations and to participate in round tables.\n\n2.3. We also note the willingness of the neighbouring States of the countries referred to in point 1.4 to take part in the process of negotiations when the nature of the problems in question requires their participation, and the willingness of other  States to make their contribution to this process of negotiations.\n\n2.4. We take note of the fact that the European Union is ready to play an active role in the bilateral or regional talks. The European Union expresses its readiness to play the role of moderator in the bilateral talks at the request of the interested  parties. We take note that the European Union is already contributing to the economic restructuring and the strengthening of democratic institutions in the region and is also prepared to put at the disposal of the countries concerned, in the framework  of the existing Europe Agreements, other agreements and programmes, the appropriate support to facilitate the achievement of the objectives of the Pact.\n\n2.5. Other existing regional structures and international institutions could also contribute, through their activities, to promote constructive cooperation and good neighbourly relations at a regional level.\n\n2.6. We have agreed that the procedures will call on the concept of the negotiation tables developed on the basis of the 1992 Helsinki Document, which pointed out regional cooperation as a valuable means of promoting pluralistic structures of stability.  These tables will aim on the one hand to improve good-neighbourly relations and on the other hand to identify the projects of common interest for the participating countries.\n\nACCORDINGLY\n\n2.7. We, Ministers of Foreign Affairs and representatives of states participating in the Conference, have agreed to set up regional round tables. Their composition, the fields of cooperation and the working procedures are defined in a document for the  organisation of regional round tables.\n\n2.8. The aim of these round tables is to create favourable conditions for the establishment and the improvement of good neighbourly relations, including questions related to miniorities and borders.\n\n2.9. We take note of the willingness of the countries referred to in 1.4 to include the existing good neighbourly relations agreements in the Pact, if the parties agree, or in the absence of such agreements, to intensify or launch negotiations.\n\n2.10. The countries referred to in point 1.4 willing to negotiate may invite neighbouring or other countries as well as relevant international organizations and institutions to join them at their regional round tables, if they so wish, in order to  contribute to the pursuit of good neighbourly relations, bilaterally and at regional level.\n\n2.11. The regional round tables will be convened at the earliest opportunity at the invitation of the European Union. In so doing, the Union will closely consult with the CSCE which participate through its institutions.\n\nPart 3:  3.1. We ask the European Institutions, and the CSCE and Council of Europe in particular, to help to ensure the smooth functioning of the negotiations.\n\nPart 4: Assessment of the negotiations  4.1. We are determined to achieve our objective, which is the conclusion of the Pact on Stability, as swiftly as possible.\n\n4.2. Accordingly:\n\n- The European Union will set up a group, open to interested States and the CSCE, which will meet regularly during the process to see to it that it advances and to facilitate its operation.\n\n- This group could call an interim conference in order to assess progress achieved.\n\nPart 5: The final conference and the role of the CSCE  5.1. The final Conference will be held, if the progress of the proceedings so permits, within one year of the inaugural Conference. It will be responsible for adopting the Pact on Stability.\n\n5.2. The Pact on Stability in Europe will be entrusted to the CSCE which will be requested to be responsible for evaluating and for monitoring, according to its procedures, the implementattion of the agreements and arrangements as well as the  commitments which comprise them, placing the follow-up activities and meetings within the susbstantive and organizational context of the CSCE.\n\n5.3. We are mindful of the political importance of the proposed Pact on Stability and have adopted the concluding documents to guide us in this important endeavour.\n\nII. DOCUMENT FOR THE ORGANISATION OF REGIONAL ROUND TABLES  The present document refers to the document of the inaugural Conference for a Pact on Stability in Europe and in particular to its following points 1.7, 2.6 and 2.7 to 2.11.\n\nA. The countries referred to in point 1.4 of the Document are willing to participate in the regional round tables. Their neighbouring countries, other countries willing to give their contribution as well as relevant international organizations and  institutions which so wish, could also be invited, without any commitment in this respect ensuring from that for the future, and without prejudice to the content of their contribution.\n\nThe objective of the regional round tables will be the identification of arrangements and projects aimed at facilitating the achievement and the realization of agreements and measures for good neighbourly relations in areas such as those listed below,  which are merely indicative:\n\n(a) regional transborder cooperation;\n\n(b) questions relating to minorities;\n\n(c) cultural cooperation, including language training;\n\n(d) economic cooperation and administrative training;\n\n(e) legal cooperation and administrative training;\n\n(f) environmental problems.\n\nB. For the countries referred to in point 1.4, there will be two round tables:\n\n- one for the baltic region,\n\n- one for the other central and eastern European countries,\n\nThe round tables will be composed of the interested countries in the region mentioned in point 1.4, with the participation of the European Union, of relevant international organizations and institutions and of countries which with the agreement of the  interested countries wish to contribute to the project.\n\nThe Baltic round table should discuss general political issues of the region and should promote regional cooperation relating for example to integration of populations of foreign origin, national minorities, language training, ombudsman, transborder  activities and maritime cooperation, cooperation among regions of neighbouring countries.\n\nC. The round table meetings should be grouped both in terms of location and timing, attendance depending on the items to be discussed. The modalities will be determined by the participants of the round tables.\n\nThey could be chaired by the European Union and take place either in rotation in the countries of the region or at the invitation of individual countries or of the European Union or possibly in Vienna, at the seat of the Permanent Committee of the CSCE.\n\nThe host country, or host organization, should provide at its expense meeting facilities, such as conference rooms, secretarial assistance and interpretation. The European Union has expressed its readiness to bear such expenses when meetings are held at  the seat of its institutions.""}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Having given the interested parties notice to submit their comments (2), and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By letter dated 15 December 1995, the Commission informed the Italian authorities of its decision to initiate proceedings pursuant to Article 6 (4) of Commission Decision No 3855/91/ECSC, then in force, concerning aid to be granted under the programme for the restructuring of Italy's private steel industry, in particular to Mini Acciaieria Odolese (hereinafter MAO).
In a Decision of December 1994, the Commission authorized the aid provided for in Italian Law No 481 of 3 August 1994 (hereinafter Law No 481/94) on plant closures in the Italian private steel industry, having checked that the Law complied with Decision No 3855/91/ECSC, and in particular with Article 4, and required the Italian authorities to give it prior notification of individual aid grants under the Law. The Decision provided that, in order to benefit from closure aid, a firm must have been in production for on average at least one shift per day, i.e. at least eight hours per day, for five days per weeks for the whole of 1993 and up to February 1994, when Decree Law No 396/94, subsequently converted into Law No 481/94, was notified to the Commission.
According to the information in the Commission's possession, MAO, while fulfilling the other requirements of Article 4 of the Decision on aid to closures, was not in regular production at the time of closure.
As the Commission had serious difficulty in determining whether the aid in question was compatible with the common market, it decided to initiate proceedings under Article 6 (4) of Decision No 3855/91/ECSC.
II
As part of the proceedings, the Commission invited the Italian Government to submit its comments, and informed the other Member States and interested parties by publishing the Decision initiating the proceedings.
In two letters dated 22 August 1996, the German Government and Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl sent comments to the Commission, which forwarded them to the Italian authorities on 16 September 1996. In their comments, those parties expressed support for the Commission's decision to initiate proceedings.
In response to the initiation of the procedure and to the comments of the other interested parties, the Italian Government argued inter alia as follows:
- while referring back to the Decision of December 1994, which allowed the Italian authorities to put forward objective criteria whereby plants that had operated at less than 25 % capacity could still be eligible for closure aid, the Commission Decision initiating proceedings merely stated that the criteria put forward by Italy as an alternative to the principle of 'regular production` were unsuitable,
- the criteria the Italian authorities submitted to the Commission for consideration were based on the view that the low or zero output recorded by some firms in 1993 and early 1994 was indicative not of a desire to abandon the steel market or of obsolescent or uncompetitive plant but of unfavourable cyclical conditions in connection with financial difficulties and a market crisis,
- the case submitted to the Commission for assessment concerns plant that is not experiencing any productivity problems due to technical factors. Some have recently benefited under major modernization schemes designed to increase efficiency and, since they have all been regularly maintained, each one could still, at little cost, resume regular production within a short space of time.
III
By virtue of its production, the undertaking in question is subject to the rules of the ECSC Treaty, Article 4 (c) of which stipulates that subsidies or aid granted by States in any form whatsoever are recognized as incompatible with the common market for coal and steel and are accordingly abolished and prohibited within the Community. The only possible exceptions to this general prohibition are set out explicitly and restrictively in Decision No 2496/96/ECSC, in Article 2 (aid for research and development), Article 3 (aid for environmental protection) and Article 4 (aid for closures). The Decision (hereinafter the 'Steel Aid Code`) entered into force on 1 January 1997.
It is pointed out that the exceptions to the general ban on aid to the steel industry set out in Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty are not intended in any way to make the Community rules governing aid to the steel industry less strict, since those rules are justified by the serious distortion of competition that might be caused by aid that is incompatible with the common market in a sector that continues to be very sensitive. It is therefore necessary for those rules to be strictly adhered to, which means that aid to a steel undertaking may be authorized only if the Commission has been able to determine that the conditions provided for in the Steel Aid Code have effectively been complied with.
In the present case, all the conditions are met, including the one concerning regularity of production which had led to the initiation of proceedings.
In this connection, although it provides that, in order to be eligible for aid, an undertaking must have been in regular production up to the date of notification of the closure aid, the Steel Aid Code does not give a precise definition of regular. Accordingly, in its Decision of December 1994, the Commission stated that the requirement concerned would be deemed met if the undertaking receiving the aid had been in production for on average at least one shift per day, i.e. at least eight hours per day, for five days per week for the whole of 1993 and up to 28 February 1994, when Decree Law No 396/94, converted by the Italian Parliament into Law No 481/94, was notified to the Commission. The latter decided, moreover, that the Italian authorities should be allowed to demonstrate on the basis of objective criteria that an undertaking which did not satisfy this requirement had regularly produced ECSC iron and steel products. In that case the Commission was to examine the aid on the basis of its specific circumstances in order to determine whether the condition relating to regularity of production had been fulfilled.
The purpose of Article 4 of the Steel Aid Code and of the Commission Decision of December 1994 is clear: aid for closures may be granted only to undertakings that are significantly active on the steel market, specifically as a result of regular production. The Community legislator did not, however, feel it necessary or advisable to allow an exception to the general ban in Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty, since the closure of a firm that is not in regular production does not have significant effects on the market. Accordingly, criteria which demonstrate regularity of production could be accepted as an alternative to the one provided for by the Commission in its Decision.
The greater part of the criteria put forward by the Italian Government demonstrate not that the undertaking in question was in regular production but that it was capable of producing on a regular basis. The wording of Article 4 of the Steel Aid Code rules out a broad interpretation which would allow aid to go to firms which, although they had not been in regular production, were capable of producing ECSC products on a regular basis.
From the additional information sent by the Italian authorities, however, the Commission concludes that:
- on the basis of a maximum possible production of 139 000 tonnes in 1993, MAO's capacity utilization rate is 22,3 %,
- in July and August 1993, MAO invested heavily in its plant (construction of a new cooling bed for the cold-rolling mill) which involved an almost total shutdown of production during those two months,
- on the basis of the average monthly output for 1993 alone, lost output due to the building of the new cooling bed can be estimated at 5 166 tonnes (3),
- thus the capacity utilization rate amounts to 26 % compared with its maximum possible production.
Accordingly, in view of the capacity take-up which the undertaking could have achieved without the major work on its rolling mill, it must be concluded that the undertaking was in regular production (i.e. in production for at least one shift per day, five days per week) at the time of its closure.

In the light of the foregoing, in particular the end of Part III, it must be concluded that the closure aid of Lit 5 437 million which Italy plans to grant to MAO may be declared compatible with the common market, since it satisfies the requirements of Article 4 of the Steel Aid Code.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first subparagraph of point (1) and point (4) of Article 8 and Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (3), and in particular Articles 11(1) and the second paragraph of Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules for food business operators on the hygiene of food of animal origin. That Regulation provides that food business operators producing raw milk and dairy products and colostrum and colostrum-based products intended for human consumption are to comply with the relevant provisions of Annex III thereto.
(2) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 provides that food business operators importing products of animal origin from third countries are to ensure that importation takes place only, if the third country of dispatch appears on a list drawn up in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and the products satisfy, inter alia, the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and any import conditions laid down in accordance with Union legislation governing import controls for products of animal origin.
(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 (4) lays down the public and animal health conditions and the certification requirements for the introduction of consignments of raw milk and dairy products into the Union. It also lays down the list of third countries from which the introduction of such consignments into the Union is authorised.
(4) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 establishes different import conditions depending on the animal health status of the exporting third country as regards foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and rinderpest. Third countries which are free from FMD without vaccination and rinderpest for the period for at least 12 months prior to import are listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 and imports into the Union of raw milk and dairy products, derived from raw milk from those third countries, are authorised without having undergone a specific treatments.
(5) The Commission received several requests from some Member States and trade partners to establish animal health conditions for the imports of colostrum and colostrum-based products for human consumption into the Union.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 does not apply to colostrum and colostrum-based products. However, colostrum represents the same animal health risks as raw milk for FMD. Colostrum can therefore be safely imported from countries which are already authorised for import of raw milk and listed in listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010.
(7) Several commercial products are made of pasteurised or sterilised colostrum. However, since the effects of pasteurisation and sterilisation have not been validated for colostrum which has a high cell content, pasteurised or sterilised colostrum and colostrum-based products should only be imported from those third countries which are free from FMD without vaccination, listed in column A of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010.
(8) Articles 11, 12 and 13 of Council Directive 97/78/EC (5) lay down the rules and conditions for the checks to be applied to consignment of products of animal origin imported into the Union but destined for a third country either by immediate transit or after storage in the Union.
(9) In order to allow the introduction of colostrum and colostrum-based products into the Union, a new model health certificate for such commodities should be added in Part 2 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 and the model health certificate for raw milk and dairy products for human consumption intended for transit through or storage in the Union set out in Part 3 of Annex II to that Regulation should be amended in order to cover colostrum and colostrum-based products.
(10) In order to include colostrum and colostrum-based products in the scope of the Common Veterinary Entry Document referred to in Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 (6), it is necessary to provide in the model of health certificates covering such products the appropriate Harmonised System code listed in Chapter 4 of Annex I to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC (7).
(11) To avoid any disruption in trade, the use of animal health certificate for raw milk and dairy products for human consumption, intended for transit through or storage in the Union, issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 605/2010, should be authorised during a transitional period.
(12) Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '6.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 66/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 209/2014\nof 5 March 2014\namending Regulation (EU) No 605/2010 as regards animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions for the introduction of colostrum and colostrum-based products intended for human consumption into the Union\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules for food business operators on the hygiene of food of animal origin.

(3) In accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Commission makes initial allocations to Member States each year on the basis of objective criteria, taking account of particular situations and needs and the efforts to be undertaken in the light of the scheme's objective.
(4) The Commission fixed the indicative financial allocations for the 2001/2002 marketing year in Decision 2001/666/EC(5).
(5) In accordance with Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, initial allocations must be adapted in view of real expenditure and on the basis of revised expenditure forecasts notified by the Member States, taking into account the objective of the scheme and subject to the funds available.
(6) Under Article 16(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, Member States may submit a request for subsequent financing in the current financial year. Under Article 17(2) of that Regulation, this request is accepted for Member States that have expended their initial allocation on a pro rata basis using the appropriations available after deducting, for all Member States, the sum of the amounts notified in accordance with Article 16(1)(a) of that Regulation from the total amount allocated to the Member States.
(7) Under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, the Member States' actual expenditure is corrected if the number of hectares restructured is less than the number of hectares laid down in Decision 2001/666/EC. This provision applies for this financial year to Greece, Luxembourg and Portugal.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on environmental quality standards in the field of water policy, amending and subsequently repealing Council Directives 82/176/EEC, 83/513/EEC, 84/156/EEC, 84/491/EEC, 86/280/EEC and amending Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), and in particular Article 8b(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC provides for the establishment of a watch list of, in the first instance, up to 10 substances or groups of substances for which Union-wide monitoring data are to be gathered for the purpose of supporting future prioritisation exercises in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). The list should include an indication of the monitoring matrices and possible methods of analysis not entailing excessive costs.
(2) Article 8b of Directive 2008/105/EC specifies, inter alia, the conditions and modalities for the monitoring of the substances included in the watch list, for the reporting of the monitoring results by the Member States, and for the updating of the list.
(3) The substances in the watch list should be selected from amongst those for which the information available indicates that they may pose a significant risk, at Union level, to or via the aquatic environment, but for which monitoring data are insufficient to come to a conclusion on the actual risk posed. Highly toxic substances, used in many Member States and discharged to the aquatic environment but not or rarely monitored, should be considered for inclusion in the watch list. That selection process should take into account information as itemised in points (a) to (e) of Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC, giving particular consideration to emerging pollutants.
(4) The monitoring of the substances in the watch list should generate high-quality data on their concentrations in the aquatic environment, fit for the purpose of supporting, in a separate review exercise according to Article 16(4) of Directive 2000/60/EC, the risk assessments that underpin the identification of priority substances. In that review, substances found to pose a significant risk should be considered for inclusion in the priority substances list. An environmental quality standard would then also be set, which Member States would have to meet. The proposal of a substance for inclusion in the priority substances list would be subject to an impact assessment.
(5) In accordance with Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC, diclofenac, 17-beta-estradiol (E2) and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) should be included in the first watch list, in order to gather monitoring data for the purpose of facilitating the determination of appropriate measures to address the risk posed by those substances. Estrone (E1) should also be included in the watch list because of its close chemical relationship to 17-beta-estradiol, of which it is a breakdown product.
(6) During 2014, the Commission gathered data on a range of other substances that could be included in the watch list. It took account of the information sources referred to in Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC, and consulted experts from Member States, and stakeholder groups. A ranking process was conducted. This considered in particular substances which came close to being prioritised in the most recently completed priority substances review, but for which monitoring data were still needed to confirm a significant risk. It also considered several other substances identified as potential emerging pollutants, for which few or no recent monitoring data were available. The risk posed by each of those substances was calculated from the available information on their intrinsic hazard and the exposure of the environment to them. Exposure was estimated from data on the extent of production and use, taking account of any actual monitoring data.
(7) In the course of gathering data on the substances in the initial list, additional monitoring data were found for some of those substances. The availability of reliable, up-to-date data for at least four Member States was considered sufficient for not including substances in the watch list. When those substances were discounted, along with some others for which there was particular doubt about their toxicity, or whose use was expected to be discontinued, the following were identified as the most highly ranked: oxadiazon, methiocarb, 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methylphenol, tri-allate, four neonicotinoid pesticides, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, and 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate. Those substances should therefore also be included in the watch list, identified by their Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) and EU numbers. A fifth neonicotinoid pesticide and two other macrolide antibiotics were also determined to potentially pose a significant risk. The possibility that substances with the same mode of action could have additive effects additionally justifies proposing their simultaneous inclusion in the watch list. It should be possible to analyse the neonicotinoids simultaneously, and likewise the macrolide antibiotics, allowing them to be grouped in the list.
(8) In accordance with Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC, the Commission has identified possible methods of analysis for the proposed substances. The method detection limit should be at least as low as the substance-specific predicted no-effect concentration for each substance in the relevant matrix. If new information leads to a decrease in the predicted no-effect concentration for particular substances, the maximum acceptable method detection limit might have to be lowered while those substances remain on the list. The analytical methods are not considered to entail excessive costs.
(9) For comparability, all substances should be monitored in whole water samples. However, it would be appropriate to monitor 2-ethylhexyl 4-methoxycinnamate also in suspended particulate matter or sediment, because of its tendency to partition into this matrix.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 21(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC,","{'header': '24.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 78/40', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/495\nof 20 March 2015\nestablishing a watch list of substances for Union-wide monitoring in the field of water policy pursuant to Directive 2008/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2015) 1756)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8b(1) of Directive 2008/105/EC provides for the establishment of a watch list of, in the first instance, up to 10 substances or groups of substances for which Union-wide monitoring data are to be gathered for the purpose of supporting future prioritisation exercises in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2).

Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991, laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 96/43/EC(4), and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 98/372/EC lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certifications for import of live animals of bovine and swine species from certain European countries(5).
(2) Commission Decision 97/232/EC draws up lists of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of sheep and goats(6).
(3) Following confirmation of outbreaks of bluetongue in July 1999, in the region of Bourgas in Bulgaria, Commission Decision 1999/542/EC(7) laid down certain protective measures with regard to imports of animals of bovine, caprine and ovine species originating from and transiting Bulgaria.
(4) Following a Commission mission carried out in November 2000 it appears that controls by the Bulgarian veterinary services and the general animal health situation have considerably improved.
(5) Concerning bluetongue in particular, a monitoring programme has been set up over a period of time, and based on the results of this survey, together with the information and guarantees provided by the competent veterinary authorities, it becomes possible to regionalise Bulgaria with a view to allowing the import into the Community of bovines, sheep and goats.
(6) Some measures must be retained however in order to ensure that live animals of the bovine, ovine and caprine species do not originate from or pass through that part of Bulgaria comprising the provinces of Bourgas, Jambol, Hasskovo and Kardgali.
(7) Decision 1999/542/EC should be repealed and Decisions 97/232/EC and 98/372/EC amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 the Council is to establish the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking into account, inter alia, available scientific advice.
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries and to allocate them in accordance with prescribed criteria.
(3) The latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) concerning certain stocks of fish found in the deep sea indicates that those stocks are harvested unsustainably, and that fishing opportunities for those stocks should be reduced in order to assure their sustainability.
(4) The ICES has further advised that the exploitation rate of orange roughy in ICES Area VII is far too high. Scientific advice further indicates that orange roughy in Area VI is heavily depleted, and areas of vulnerable aggregations of these species have been identified. It is therefore appropriate to prohibit fishing for orange roughy in those areas.
(5) The Community is a contracting party to the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention, which has recommended a limitation on the fishing effort deployed to catch certain deep-sea species. That recommendation should therefore be implemented by the Community.
(6) In order to ensure effective management of quotas, the specific conditions under which fishing operations occur should be established.
(7) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (2), it is necessary to indicate which stocks are subject to the various measures fixed therein.
(8) Scientific advice from ICES concerning most of the deep-sea species indicates that fishing effort should be reduced. In the absence of specific measures limiting the activity of vessels fishing for deep-sea species, it is therefore appropriate to adjust available effort by adjusting the power and capacity of the fishing fleet in accordance with the scientific advice.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation should be fixed by reference to ICES zones as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the Northeast Atlantic (3) and to CECAF zones (Committee for Eastern Central Atlantic Fisheries) as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/95 of 23 October 1995 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in certain areas other than those of the North Atlantic (4).
(10) The fishing opportunities should be utilised in accordance with the Community legislation on the matter, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels (5), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States' catches of fish (6), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (7), Council Regulation (EC) No 88/98 of 18 December 1997 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the waters of the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound (8), Council Regulation (EC) No 1627/94 of 27 June 1994 laying down general provisions concerning special fishing permits (9) and Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (10).
(11) In order to ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2005.

(87/376/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular the third paragraph of Article 71 thereof,
Having regard to the requests made by the Member States,
Whereas under the provisions of the ECSC Treaty the principle of freedom of movement necessarily applies to products originating in third countries which are in free circulation in the Community;
Whereas these provisions preclude, in the case of intra-Community trade, any requirement, even of a purely formal nature, to submit import licences or any similar procedure;
Whereas the Commission, in response to the crisis in the iron and steel sector, has adopted measures with both internal and external effects; whereas, in this context, measures have been adopted in respect of imports of certain products originating in certain third countries with a view to ensuring adherence to traditional trade flows between the Community and these countries, including at regional level;
Whereas the combined effect of these measures is not, however, such as to eliminate the risk of deflections of trade in the case of the products in question;
Whereas under these circumstances it is important to ensure that full information is available on prospective imports of products originating in third countries in free circulation in certain Member States and the terms under which the products concerned are imported; whereas the Member States ought accordingly to be authorized to institute prior surveillance of these imports by making them subject to the issue of an import document;
Whereas this import document must be issued automatically, within a fixed time limit and for all the quantities applied for;
Whereas application of these surveillance measures must be of strictly limited duration;
Whereas, so that checking the origin of imports does not act as a barrier to intra-Community trade, the Member States ought as a general rule to be obliged, as part of the formalities for the importation of a product from another Member State, to confine themselves to asking the importer for a simple declaration on the origin of the product, on the basis of what he may reasonably be expected to know of it;
Whereas it is important that the Member States should keep the Commission regularly informed of the results of the surveillance,","{'title': '87/376/ECSC: Commission Decision of 24 June 1987 authorizing the Member States to institute intra-Community surveillance of the importation for home use of certain iron and steel products originating in certain third countries and covered by the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and in free circulation in the Community', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas the leading insurer is better placed than the other co-insurers to assess claims and to fix the minimum amount of reserves for outstanding claims;
Whereas work is in progress on the winding-up of insurance undertakings ; whereas provision must be made at this stage to ensure that, in the event of winding-up, beneficiaries under Community co-insurance contracts enjoy equality of treatment with beneficiaries in respect of the other insurance business, irrespective of the nationality of such persons;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 480/2006
of 23 March 2006
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(7) With reference to Article 3(3) of Directive 94/22/EC a notice was published on 12 September 1995 in the Official Journal of the European Communities(8) declaring that the whole territory of Austria is available on a permanent basis in the sense of the Article provided that there are no existing prospection, production and storage contracts relating to hydrocarbons, or existing mining rights which also include hydrocarbons.
(8) The ""Bundesgesetz 1997 amending the Bundesvergabegesetz 1993""(9), ( hereinafter the ""Bundesvergabegesetz 1997"") which entered into force on 1 January 1997, implemented Directive 93/38/EEC into Austrian law at federal level. Section 86 of the Bundesvergabegesetz 1997 repeats the terms of Article 3(2) of Directive 93/38/EEC and guarantees compliance with the principles of non-discrimination and competitive procurement by entities carrying out exploration or extraction, in particular as regards the information they make available to enterprises concerning their intentions with respect to the award of contracts, and compliance with the obligation to transmit to the Commission information on the award of such contracts. It further provides that compliance with Article 3(1) of Directive 93/38/EEC through the corresponding provisions in Section 86(2)(1 to 5) Bundesvergabegesetz 1997 is presumed for enterprises which are granted the right to exploit geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas on the basis of Section 68 and following of the Mineralrohstoffgesetz.
(9) On 1 July 1994, five contracts for the exploration, production and storage of hydrocarbons existed between the Republic of Austria and the OMV AG and three such contracts existed between the Republic of Austria and the Rohöl-Aufsuchungs AG (RAG), to all of which the provisions of the Berggesetz 1975 applied.
(10) On the basis of the Allgemeine Berggesetz 1854, limited authorisations were granted for production of oil and gas. These authorisations concern mineral raw materials (mining rights) and were granted before the implementation of the Bitumengesetz on 31 August 1938 or on the basis of interim provisions laid down in this law. The production of oil and gas by the RAG, the Van Sickle GesmbH and the OMV in the Land Niederösterreich is based on such authorizations,","{'title': '2002/205/EC: Commission Decision of 4 March 2002 following a request by Austria applying for the special regime provided for in Article 3 of Directive 93/38/EEC (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 684)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 4 March 2002 the exploitation of geographical areas for the purpose of exploring for or extracting oil or gas shall not be considered in Austria as an activity defined in Article 2(2)(b)(i) of Directive 93/38/EEC.\n\nEntities carrying on such an activity shall not be considered in Austria as operating under special or exclusive rights within the meaning of Article 2(3)(b) of the Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 22 October 2008
setting up a European Cluster Policy Group
(2008/824/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) Article 157 of the Treaty assigned the Community and the Member States the task of ensuring that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Community's industry exist, as well as fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development.
(2) Article 13 of Decision No 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to 2013) (1), calls for action to foster sector-specific innovation, clusters, innovation networks, public-private innovation partnerships and cooperation with relevant international organisations, and the use of innovation management.
(3) In its Communication ‘Putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU’ (2) the Commission recognises the important role of clusters for competitiveness and innovation as instruments for closing the gap between business, research and resources, thereby bringing knowledge faster to the market, and calls for a strategic policy orientation and cooperation.
(4) In its conclusions of 4 December 2006 the Competitiveness Council identified clusters as one of the nine strategic priorities for the implementation of the broad-based European innovation strategy.
(5) The European Council of 13 and 14 March 2008 stressed in its conclusions that the framework conditions for innovation should be better coordinated, including through improved science-industry linkages and world-class innovation clusters and the development of regional clusters and networks.
(6) The European Cluster Memorandum, launched at the European Presidency Conference on Innovation and Clusters in Stockholm on 22 and 23 January 2008 and signed by more than 70 national and regional authorities and agencies, marked an important step for further encouraging cluster development.
(7) The European Cluster Alliance, which currently brings together more than 70 partner organisations across Europe, was a first step towards cluster policy cooperation across the EU.
(8) In its opinion on clusters and cluster policy adopted on 19 June 2008, the Committee of the Regions calls for the setting-up of a High Level Expert Group on Clusters, which could serve as a platform for discussing the implementation of a general strategic framework for clusters.
(9) In the Communication from the Commission ‘Towards world-class clusters in the European Union: Implementing the broad-based innovation strategy’ (3), the establishment of a European Cluster Policy Group is identified as an important step of the policy agenda in support of world-class clusters in the EU.
(10) It is therefore necessary to set up a European Cluster Policy Group and define its tasks and structure.
(11) With a view to achieving the above-mentioned objectives the Commission needs to call upon the contributions of policy makers and experts in the field of cluster development.
(12) The European Cluster Policy Group should share intelligence about cluster policies with a view to further exploring how to better assist Member States in supporting the emergence of world-class clusters in the EU.
(13) The European Cluster Policy Group should be composed of high-level members with experience and competence in the field of competitiveness and innovation policies and with a very good understanding of the role and functioning of clusters in economic development.
(14) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the European Cluster Policy Group should be provided for, without prejudice to the rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom (4).
(15) Personal data relating to members of the European Cluster Policy Group should be collected, processed and published in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5).
(16) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension,","{'header': '30.10.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 288/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 October 2008\nsetting up a European Cluster Policy Group\n(2008/824/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 157 of the Treaty assigned the Community and the Member States the task of ensuring that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Community's industry exist, as well as fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development.\n\n((2)) Article 13 of Decision No 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to 2013)(1), calls for action to foster sector-specific innovation, clusters, innovation networks, public-private innovation partnerships and cooperation with relevant international organisations, and the use of innovation management.\n\n((3)) In its Communication ‘Putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU’(2)the Commission recognises the important role of clusters for competitiveness and innovation as instruments for closing the gap between business, research and resources, thereby bringing knowledge faster to the market, and calls for a strategic policy orientation and cooperation.\n\n((4)) In its conclusions of 4 December 2006 the Competitiveness Council identified clusters as one of the nine strategic priorities for the implementation of the broad-based European innovation strategy.\n\n((5)) The European Council of 13 and 14 March 2008 stressed in its conclusions that the framework conditions for innovation should be better coordinated, including through improved science-industry linkages and world-class innovation clusters and the development of regional clusters and networks.\n\n((6)) The European Cluster Memorandum, launched at the European Presidency Conference on Innovation and Clusters in Stockholm on 22 and 23 January 2008 and signed by more than 70 national and regional authorities and agencies, marked an important step for further encouraging cluster development.\n\n((7)) The European Cluster Alliance, which currently brings together more than 70 partner organisations across Europe, was a first step towards cluster policy cooperation across the EU.\n\n((8)) In its opinion on clusters and cluster policy adopted on 19 June 2008, the Committee of the Regions calls for the setting-up of a High Level Expert Group on Clusters, which could serve as a platform for discussing the implementation of a general strategic framework for clusters.\n\n((9)) In the Communication from the Commission ‘Towards world-class clusters in the European Union: Implementing the broad-based innovation strategy’(3), the establishment of a European Cluster Policy Group is identified as an important step of the policy agenda in support of world-class clusters in the EU.\n\n((10)) It is therefore necessary to set up a European Cluster Policy Group and define its tasks and structure.\n\n((11)) With a view to achieving the above-mentioned objectives the Commission needs to call upon the contributions of policy makers and experts in the field of cluster development.\n\n((12)) The European Cluster Policy Group should share intelligence about cluster policies with a view to further exploring how to better assist Member States in supporting the emergence of world-class clusters in the EU.\n\n((13)) The European Cluster Policy Group should be composed of high-level members with experience and competence in the field of competitiveness and innovation policies and with a very good understanding of the role and functioning of clusters in economic development.\n\n((14)) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the European Cluster Policy Group should be provided for, without prejudice to the rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom(4).\n\n((15)) Personal data relating to members of the European Cluster Policy Group should be collected, processed and published in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data(5).\n\n((16)) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular points 1, 4 and 5 of Article 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2007/777/EC of 29 November 2007 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of certain meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decision 2005/432/EC (2) lays down rules on imports into the Union and transits through and storage in the Union of consignments of meat products and consignments of treated stomachs, bladders and intestines, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3).
(2) Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC sets out the list of third countries or parts thereof from which the introduction into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines into the Union is authorised, provided that those commodities comply with the treatment referred to in that Part. Where third countries are regionalised for the purposes of inclusion in that list, their regionalised territories are set out in Part 1 of that Annex.
(3) Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC sets out the treatments referred to in Part 2 of that Annex, assigning a code to each of those treatments. That Part sets out a non-specific treatment ‘A’ and specific treatments ‘B’ to ‘F’ listed in descending order of severity. These are the treatments listed in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC which are considered effective in eliminating certain animal health risks linked to meat and milk.
(4) Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC has been recently amended by Commission Implementing Decision 2013/417/EU (4) in order to introduce a treatment effective against foot-and-mouth disease virus in meat recommended in the relevant chapter of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE Terrestrial Code) (5).
(5) It is therefore opportune to amend Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC in order to reflect that amendment to Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC.
(6) Russia has asked to authorise import into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines from domestic bovine, farmed cloven-hoofed game and domestic ovine and caprine animals from the Russian region of Kaliningrad which have undergone the abovementioned treatment provided for in the OIE Terrestrial Code.

(7) The Russian region of Kaliningrad is currently listed in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC as authorised for the introduction into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines from domestic bovine animals, farmed cloven-hoofed game, domestic ovine or caprine animals and domestic porcine animals and wild cloven-hoofed game which have undergone the specific treatment ‘C’.
(8) Taking into account the animal health situation in the Russian region of Kaliningrad, it is appropriate to authorise imports from that region into the Union of meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines from domestic bovine, farmed cloven-hoofed game and domestic ovine and caprine animals which have undergone the specific treatment introduced in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to authorise such imports into the Union from the Russian region of Kaliningrad and therefore amend accordingly the entries for that region in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 92/102/EEC of 27 November 1992 on the identification and registration of animals (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2) Pursuant to Article 3(1)(c) of Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (4), animals for intra-Community trade must be identified in accordance with the requirements of Community rules and be registered in such a way that the original or transit holding, centre or organisation can be traced. Before 1 January 1993, those identification and registration systems had to be extended to the movements of animals within the territory of each Member State.
(3) Article 14 of Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries (5) states that the identification and registration provided for in Article 3(1)(c) of Directive 90/425/EEC of such animals must, except in the case of animals for slaughter and registered equidae, be carried out after the said checks have been made.
(4) It is necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient exchange of information between Member States for the correct application of this Directive. Community provisions have been laid down by Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters (6) and by Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters (7).
(5) Keepers of animals should maintain up-to-date records of the animals on their holdings. Persons involved in the commerce of animals should keep records of their dealings. The competent authority should have access to these records on request.
(6) In order to permit movements of animals to be traced rapidly and accurately, animals should be able to be identified. A decision should be taken at a later date to determine the nature of the mark and, pending such decision, the national systems of identification should be maintained for movements restricted to the national market.
(7) Provision should be made for the possibility of waiving the requirements for marks in the case of animals moving directly from a farm to a slaughterhouse. However, these animals should in any case be identified so that their farm of origin can be traced.
(8) Provision should be made for the possibility of waiving the obligation to register the keepers of animals kept for personal purposes and, in order to take into account certain particular cases, the procedures for keeping registers.
(9) In the case of animals in which the mark has become illegible or been lost, a new mark enabling a link with the previous mark to be established should be applied.
(10) This Directive should not affect specific requirements set out in Commission Decision 89/153/EEC of 13 February 1989 concerning the correlation of samples taken for residue examination with animals and their farms of origin (8) or any relevant applicatory rules established in accordance with Directive 91/496/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3769/85 (2), and in particular Article 5 (2) thereof,
After consulting the Fund Committee,
Whereas, under Article 5 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts presented by the Member States, clears the accounts of the authorities and bodies referred to in Article 4 of that Regulation;
Whereas the Italian Republic has transmitted to the Commission the documents required to clear the accounts for 1982; whereas the latter has carried out on-the-spot inspection as provided for in Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70;
Whereas Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1723/72 of 26 July 1972 on the clearance of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (3), provides that the Decision to clear the accounts must include the determination of the amount of expenditure incurred in each Member State during the financial year in question recognized as chargeable to the Fund, Guarantee Section, and also the determination of the amount of the Community's financial resources still available in each Member State;
Whereas under Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, only refunds on exports to non-member countries and intervention intended to stabilize agricultural markets, respectively granted and undertaken according to Community rules within the framework of the common organization of agricultural markets, may be financed; whereas the inspections carried out show that a part of the expenditure declared amounting to Lit 23 105 646 794 does not satisfy the requirements of these provisions and therefore must be disallowed; whereas the Member State has been fully informed of this deduction and has been able to give its views thereon;
Whereas the Decisions concerning the clearance of the accounts for 1976 and 1977 disallowed a total of Lit 17 830 219 594 relating to wine; whereas the judgements given by the Court of Justice in Cases 55 and 56/83 annulled in part the Commission's Decisions 83/37/EEC (4) and 83/48/EEC (5) on the clearance of the 1976 and 1977 accounts for Italy with regard to the financing of part of the expenditure on wine; whereas, for this reason, an amount of Lit 1 747 478 626 must be recognized under the present clearance procedure and an amount of Lit 3 482 151 394 must be definitively disallowed; whereas the Decision relating to an amount of Lit 12 600 589 574, still subject to bilateral examination, must be held over to a subsequent clearance procedure;
Whereas the Decisions concerning the clearance of accounts for 1978 to 1981 disallowed a total of Lit 46 777 787 802, with the reservation that such expenditure or part thereof might be recognized when the 1982 accounts were cleared, provided the Member State submitted the evidence necessary for Community financing; whereas, since some of this evidence has been provided, a part-amount of Lit 24 263 348 452 may still be recognized; on the other hand, an amount of Lit 11 777 200 020 must be definitively disallowed, and, with regard to an amount of Lit 10 737 239 330, the Decision is to be taken under a subsequent clearance procedure in the light of the judgments of the Court of Justice;
Whereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be drawn in any subsequent clearance of accounts for national aids in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty or infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty currently in progress or concluded after the date of 1 October 1985 or as a result
of infringements in 1982 or national aids incompatible with the Treaty paid in 1982 having affected the expenditure charged to the EAGGF in any financial year subsequent to that of 1982;
Whereas this Decision is without prejudice to any financial consequences which may be determined by the Commission in the course of a subsequent clearance of accounts relating to current investigations, financial losses resulting from irregularities in the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 or judgments by the Court of Justice on cases currently under consideration and concerning matters which are also the subject of this Decision,","{'title': '86/444/EEC: Commission Decision of 1 July 1986 on the clearance of the accounts presented by the Italian Republic in respect of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, expenditure for 1982 (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe expenditure by the Italian Republic recognized as chargeable to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, in respect of the 1982 financial year amounts, in accordance with the Annex, to Lit 3 315 535 287 203.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe financial resources available at the end of 1982 amount, in accordance with the Annex, to Lit 165 640 874 296.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 1 July 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 94, 28. 4. 1970, p. 13.\n\n(2) OJ No L 362, 31. 12. 1985, p. 17.\n\n(3) OJ No L 186, 16. 8. 1972, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ No L 38, 10. 2. 1983, p. 30.\n\n(5) OJ No L 40, 12. 2. 1983, p. 55.\n\nANNEX\n\nClearance of the accounts concerning the expenditure financed by the EAGGF, Guarantee Section, for 1982\n\n1.2.3 //  //  // (Italian lire)   // 1.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 12 November 2001, the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of certain filament yarns of cellulose acetate (product concerned) originating in Lithuania and the United States of America (USA).
(2) The complaint was lodged by the ComitĂŠ International de la Rayonne et des Fibres SynthĂŠtiques (CIRFS) acting on behalf of the Community producers responsible for over 90 % of the total Community production of the product concerned pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation).
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) The Commission, after consultation, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), accordingly initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the product concerned, currently classifiable within CN codes 5403 33 10, 5403 33 90 and 5403 42 00 and originating in Lithuania and the USA.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the representative users, raw material suppliers and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By a letter of 6 February 2003 to the Commission, CIRFS formally withdrew its complaint.
(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Lithuania and the USA should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.
(10) Any duties provisionally secured on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1662/2002(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 158/2003(5), for the product concerned should be released,","{'title': '2003/167/EC: Commission Decision of 11 March 2003 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain filament yarns of cellulose acetate originating in Lithuania and the United States of America and releasing the amounts secured by way of the provisional duties imposed', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain non-textured artificial filament yarn of cellulose acetate, falling within CN codes 5403 33 10, 5403 33 90 and 5403 42 00 and originating in Lithuania and the United States of America, is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1662/2002 shall be released.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 March 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 305, 7.11.2002, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ C 364, 20.12.2001, p. 3.\n\n(4) OJ L 251, 19.9.2002, p. 9; corrigendum OJ L 258, 26.9.2002, p. 35.\n\n(5) OJ L 25, 30.1.2003, p. 35.'}]}"

This restriction was introduced in order to prevent excessive number of applications for licences, which could result in a fragmentation of the market and a risk in a loss of market share for the exporters of the Union.
(2) The quantities applied for the quota year 2011/12 were for the first time lower than the quota quantities available. In case of remaining quantities, it is appropriate to allocate those quantities to the applicants who are interested in receiving higher quantities than those requested, provided that the security is increased accordingly.
(3) With a view to maximising the use of the quota in the following years, it is appropriate to extend the scope of the licence applications to all the products covered by the tariff quota as provided for in the Economic Partnership Agreement between the Cariforum States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part (3), the signature and provisional application of which have been approved by Council Decision 2008/805/EC (4). Moreover, as regards the validity of export licences, the derogation provided for in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 should not be limited only to products belonging to the same product category as referred to in Annex I thereof, but it should be extended to any of the products covered by the tariff quota.
(4) As export refunds are fixed at 0 since 2008 export licence applications and licences should show the Combined Nomenclature codes instead of the product codes in the nomenclature for refunds. The relevant provisions should be adjusted accordingly.
(5) For the purpose of good management, it is necessary for the Commission to have earlier than 31 August notification on the quantity for which licences have been issued. Conversely, the notification on the quantities allocated is superfluous and can be abolished.
(6) Article 28(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1187/2009 provides that exports licence applications are only admissible where applicants lodge a security in accordance with Article 9 thereof. The exception of Article 9 of that Regulation laid down in Article 33(1) thereof is therefore inconsistent.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 28 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Nord-Pas-de-Calais; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;

Whereas, by letter dated 24 April 1968, the Government of the Polish People's Republic stated that it was prepared to give such guarantee for exports to the Community of slaughtered fowls, ducks and geese : whereas it will ensure that such exports are made only by the State foreign trade agency Animex ; whereas it will ensure also that deliveries of the above-mentioned products are not made at free-at-Community-frontier prices lower than the sluice-gate prices valid on the day of customs clearance ; whereas, to that end it will see to it in particular that the State foreign trade agency Animex does not take any action which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the sluice-gate prices, such as taking over marketing or transport costs, granting reductions, resorting to linked transactions or any other action having similar effect;

(1) By Decision 2012/734/EU, the Council authorised the signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and Central America on the other (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Agreement’). Pursuant to Decision 2012/734/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion.
(2) Annex II to the Agreement concerns the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation. For a number of products, Appendix 2A to that Annex provides for the possibility of derogations from the rules of origin set out in Appendix 2 to Annex II in the framework of annual quotas. As the Union has decided to use that possibility, it is necessary to provide the conditions for the application of those derogations for imports from Guatemala.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 (2) introduces the implementing rules for the single payment scheme as from 2005.
(2) Experience of the administrative and operational implementation of that scheme at national level has shown that in certain respects further detailed rules are needed and in other respects the existing rules need to be clarified and adapted.
(3) In order to facilitate the transfer of payment entitlements to farmers the creation of fractions of entitlements without land and their transfer should be provided for.
(4) In case payment entitlements whose unit value has been increased by more than 20 % by reference amounts from the national reserve have not been used in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 42(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 only the increase of the value shall revert immediately to the national reserve.
(5) Entitlements allocated from the national reserve in case of administrative acts or court’s rulings in order to compensate farmers shall not be subject to the restrictions in accordance with Article 42(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
(6) In order to facilitate the circulation of payment entitlements farmers may give up voluntarily payment entitlements to the national reserve.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 795/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Due to the fact that the cases addressed by Articles 1(2) and 1(4) may have occurred as from 1 January of respectively 2005 and 2006, it is appropriate to provide that these Articles apply retroactively from those dates.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2003/298/EC of 14 April 2003 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(1), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Decision 2003/298/EC, the Community has undertaken to establish for each marketing year import tariff quotas at a zero rate of duty for wheat and meslin, wheat and meslin flour, malt and maize originating in the Czech Republic.
(2) To ensure that imports of wheat and maize covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences should be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.
(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.
(4) To ensure that the products imported from the Czech Republic are without export subsidies and not originating from public intervention stocks, the import licence application and the import licence should be accompanied by a specific certificate.
(5) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.
(6) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 325/2003(3), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.
(7) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, by way of derogation from Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 498/2003(5).
(8) Rapid two-way communication should be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.
(9) As Council Regulation (EC) No 2433/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements with the Czech Republic(6) has been repealed by Decision and 2003/298/EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2809/2000 of 20 December 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application, for cereals sector products, of Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000 and (EC) No 2851/2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Poland respectively and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1218/96(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 788/2003(8), should be amended.

Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (2), and in particular Article 22(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Following the outbreak of avian influenza, caused by a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strain, in southeastern Asia starting in December 2003, the Commission adopted several protection measures in relation to avian influenza. Those measures included, in particular, Commission Decision 2006/7/EC of 9 January 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to the import of feathers from certain third countries (3), Commission Decision 2006/265/EC of 31 March 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Switzerland (4) and Commission Decision 2006/533/EC of 28 July 2006 concerning certain temporary protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Croatia (5).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC (1), and in particular Article 7(6) and Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) At the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention updated general technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of waste consisting of, containing or contaminated with persistent organic pollutants (Decision VIII/16) were adopted. The subsection on thermal and metallurgical production of metals was added to section IV.G.2 dealing with the destruction and irreversible transformation.
(2) The update of the guidelines should be reflected in Regulation (EC) No 850/2004, because they provide a relevant source for scientific and technical progress in the treatment of wastes containing persistent organic pollutants.
(3) The updated guidelines also define the levels of destruction and irreversible transformation necessary to ensure that the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants are not exhibited. The methods should, inter alia, not exceed the atmospheric emissions value for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) of 0,1 ng TEQ/Nm3. This value is identical to the air emission limit value laid down in Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste (2). Because it is essential to require that the facilities for the treatment of waste containing persistent organic pollutants meet the emission limit values for PCDDs and PCDFs laid down in Directive 2000/76/EC those limit values should be applied whether or not the processes are subject to that Directive.
(4) The updated general technical guidelines on persistent organic pollutants also recommend in section IV.G.1 to separate the part of waste equipment which contains or is contaminated with persistent organic pollutants. This requirement clarifies the implementation of pre-treatment operations as referred to in Part 1 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. Therefore Part 1 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should be amended accordingly.
(5) The toxic equivalent factors used in Annexes IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 to calculate concentration limits for PCDDs and PCDFs were updated by the World Health Organisation in 2005 on the basis of latest scientific information. This should be reflected in Annexes IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are the most appropriate to ensure a high level of protection of human health and environment.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The Committee established by Article 18 of Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) did not deliver an opinion on the measures provided for in this Regulation within the time-limit laid down by its Chairman and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to the measures. Since, on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 850/2004, the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them, they should, under the third subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC (4), be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '15.4.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 96/33', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 304/2009\nof 14 April 2009\namending Annexes IV and V to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the treatment of waste containing persistent organic pollutants in thermal and metallurgical production processes\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) At the eighth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Basel Convention updated general technical guidelines for the environmentally sound management of waste consisting of, containing or contaminated with persistent organic pollutants (Decision VIII/16) were adopted.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas lemons are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;

Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(4) contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) The report of the Monetary Committee on statistical requirements in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 18 January 1999, underlined that, for the proper functioning of the EMU and the single market, effective surveillance and coordination of economic policies are of major importance and that this requires a comprehensive statistical information system providing policy makers with the necessary data on which to base their decisions. This report outlined the high priority in having such information available for the Community and especially for Member States participating in the euro area.
(3) The report underlined that the cross-country comparison of the labour market will demand more attention in the EMU.
(4) In order to compile quarterly statistics for the euro area, the time limit for transmission of the main aggregates of national accounts should be reduced to 70 days.
(5) Quarterly and annual derogations accorded to Member States that prevent the compilation of the main aggregates of national accounts for the euro area and the Community should be abrogated.
(6) The Action Plan on Economic and Monetary Union Statistical Requirements, endorsed by the Ecofin Council of 29 September 2000, identifies as a priority the transmission of national accounts employment data according to the unit ""hours worked"".

excluding certain groups of vessels from the fishing effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 of 18 December establishing a long-term plan for cod stocks and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 establishes a fishing effort regime whereby fishing opportunities in terms of fishing effort are allocated to Member States on an annual basis. According to Article 11(2) of that Regulation, the Council may, acting on a Commission proposal and on the basis of the information provided by Member States and the advice of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), exclude certain groups of vessels from the application of the fishing effort regime provided that appropriate data is available on the cod catches and discards of the vessels concerned, that the percentage of cod catches does not exceed 1,5 % of the total catches of the group of vessels and that the inclusion of the group in the effort regime would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks.
(2) Sweden provided information on the cod catches by a group of vessels fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat for Norway lobster with a selective sorting grid as defined in Appendix 2 to Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 43/2009 (2). On the basis of that information, as assessed by STECF, it can be established that the cod catches, including discards, of vessels involved in that activity during the period that they deploy solely that selective fishing gear, do not exceed 1,5 % of the total catches of the group of vessels involved in that activity during that same period. Moreover, having regard to the Swedish control program for cod stocks in the North Sea, Skagerrak and the Kattegat and considering that the inclusion of that group would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks, it is appropriate to exclude the group of vessels fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat for Norway lobster with a selective sorting grid, for the period where they solely deploy the gear in question, from the application of the effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008.
(3) Spain provided information on cod catches by a group of vessels fishing with bottom trawls to the West of Scotland mainly for hake. On the basis of that information, as assessed by STECF, it can be established that the cod catches, including discards, of vessels involved in that activity, do not exceed 1,5 % of the total catches of that group of vessels during that same period. Having moreover regard to the measures in place ensuring the monitoring and control of the fishing activities of the group of vessels involved in that activity and considering that the inclusion of that group would constitute an administrative burden disproportionate to its overall impact on cod stocks, it is appropriate to exclude the group of vessels fishing with bottom trawls to the West of Scotland mainly for hake, from the application of the effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008.
(4) Considering that Member States are managing the effort and the compliance with effort limitations on the basis of the fishing season running from 1 February 2009 until 31 January 2010 and having regard to the fact that Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 was adopted only shortly before the start of that season, it is appropriate that these exemptions be applicable for the entire fishing season and therefore that they apply from 1 February 2009.
(5) In order to ensure certainty for the fishermen concerned and to allow them to plan their activities for the current fishing season as soon as possible, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in Title I, Article 3, of the Protocol on the role of national Parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,","{'header': '19.8.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 214/16', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 754/2009\nof 27 July 2009\nexcluding certain groups of vessels from the fishing effort regime laid down in Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2008 establishes a fishing effort regime whereby fishing opportunities in terms of fishing effort are allocated to Member States on an annual basis.

For both substances the main data submitter provided further data in order to meet the initial concerns.
(5) The reviews of all active substances were finalised on 3 December 2002 in the format of the Commission review report for 2,4-DB, beta-cyfluthrin, cyfluthrin, iprodione, linuron, maleic hydrazide and pendimethalin.
(6) The reviews of 2,4-DB, linuron, maleic hydrazide and pendimethalin did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.
(7) The report on beta-cyfluthrin and on cyfluthrin and further information concerning both substances were also submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for separate consultations. The Committee was asked to comment on the appropriate dietary risk assessment to be used and to confirm that the available ecotoxicological data supports uses only in glasshouses and for seed treatment. In its opinions(7)(8), the Committee suggested that in addition to a long-term dietary intake risk assessment, as routinely carried out for plant protection products, beta-cyfluthrin and cyfluthrin should also undergo a short-term acute dietary risk assessment to evaluate their potential neurotoxicity properties. The Committee confirmed that uses as seed dressing and in greenhouses (except where beneficial arthropods are used) can be considered safe for non-target terrestrial and aquatic organisms, due to the specific circumstances of these applications and the immobility of beta-cyfluthrin and cyfluthrin in soil. The Committee furthermore supports the conclusions reached during the evaluation by the Member States that field spray applications of beta-cyfluthrin and cyfluthrin have not shown to be sufficiently safe under the criteria required by Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC. Following the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants the short term dietary risk assessment was subsequently provided and discussed with the Member States. It was concluded that the short-term intake of residues is not likely to exceed acceptable limits.
(8) The report on iprodione and further information were also submitted to the Scientific Committee on Plants for separate consultation. The Scientific Committee was asked to comment on the predicted environmental concentrations in soil and groundwater, and on the acceptable operator exposure level proposed by the rapporteur. In its opinion(9), the Committee agreed that sufficient information was available to reliably estimate the leaching behaviour of the substance for soils with pH above 6. However, the assessment of leaching in soils with pH below 6 deserves further attention, since, for soils with pH below 6, leaching at concentration levels exceeding 0,1 Îźg/l may occur in some realistic vulnerable situations. The Committee saw no need to use an additional safety factor for the derivation of the acceptable operator exposure level. The observations of the Scientific Committee were taken into account in this Directive and the review report.
(9) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 2,4-DB, beta-cyfluthrin, cyfluthrin, iprodione, linuron, maleic hydrazide or pendimethalin may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisation of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(10) The Commission review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide that the finalised review report, except for confidential information, should be kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.
(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(12) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing 2,4-DB, beta-cyfluthrin, cyfluthrin, iprodione, linuron, maleic hydrazide or pendimethalin, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(13) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 40(2)(d) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 39(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (2) provides that the intervention agencies may sell sugar only after a decision to that effect has been adopted by the Commission.
(2) Such a decision was taken by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1039/2006 of 7 July 2006 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden (3). Under that Regulation, tenders may be submitted for the last time between 13 and 26 September 2007.
(3) It is foreseeable that intervention stocks of sugar will continue to exist in most of the Member States concerned after expiry of that last possibility to submit tenders. In order to respond to the continued market needs, it is therefore appropriate to open a further standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available on the internal market.
(4) To allow comparison of tender prices for sugar of different qualities, the tender price should refer to sugar of the standard quality as defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(5) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to fix a minimum quantity per tenderer or per lot.
(6) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a minimum selling price for each partial invitation to tender.
(7) The minimum selling price refers to sugar of the standard quality. Provision should be made to adjust the selling price.
(8) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Hungary, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.
(9) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States on the quantities actually sold.
(10) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 (4) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Commission adopted Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health (2).
(2) However, at the time of the adoption of the list of permitted health claims, there were a number of health claims whose evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) or consideration by the Commission was not finalised (3).
(3) Among those claims, the Authority gave a favourable assessment to the health claim referring to the effect of carbohydrates on the maintenance of brain function and proposed as appropriate conditions of use for that claim that ‘a daily intake of 130 g of glycaemic carbohydrates has been estimated to cover the glucose requirement of the brain’ (4).
(4) Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that permitted health claims must be accompanied with all necessary conditions (including restrictions) for their use. Accordingly, the list of permitted claims should include the wording of the claims and specific conditions of use of the claims, and where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinions of the Authority.
(5) However, a number of Member States raised concerns that such authorisation with its conditions of use would promote and encourage consumption of foods containing sugars other than those naturally contained. Furthermore, it would convey a conflicting and confusing message to consumers, particularly in light of national dietary advice to reduce sugars consumption. It is considered that, for this specific health claim, conflicting objectives can be addressed, by authorising the claim only under specific conditions of use limiting its use to foods which are either low in sugars or to foods to which sugars have not been added although they may contain sugars naturally.
(6) This Regulation should apply six months after the date of its entry into force to enable food business operators to adapt to its requirements.
(7) In line with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Register of nutrition and health claims containing all authorised health claims should be updated in light of the present Regulation.
(8) Comments and positions from the members of the public and interested stakeholders, received by the Commission have been adequately considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.
(9) Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '24.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 282/43', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1018/2013\nof 23 October 2013\namending Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Commission adopted Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health(2).\n\n((2)) However, at the time of the adoption of the list of permitted health claims, there were a number of health claims whose evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) or consideration by the Commission was not finalised(3).\n\n((3)) Among those claims, the Authority gave a favourable assessment to the health claim referring to the effect of carbohydrates on the maintenance of brain function and proposed as appropriate conditions of use for that claim that ‘a daily intake of 130\xa0g of glycaemic carbohydrates has been estimated to cover the glucose requirement of the brain’(4).\n\n((4)) Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that permitted health claims must be accompanied with all necessary conditions (including restrictions) for their use.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 54 (2), 57, 63 (2) and 66 thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment, 1 and in particular the second and third paragraphs of Title V thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom to provide services, 2 and in particular the second and third paragraphs of Title VI thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament 3;
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee 4;
Whereas, besides making provision for the abolition of restrictions, the General Programmes provide that it should be examined whether such abolition should be preceded, accompanied or followed by mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications, and by the co-ordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action concerning the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question, and whether, if need be, transitional measures should be adopted pending such recognition or co-ordination;
Whereas not all Member States impose conditions for the taking up and pursuit of industrial and small craft activities in the manufacturing and processing industries ; whereas the definition of small craft industry, and hence the dividing-line between small craft activities and industrial activities, varies from one Member State to another ; whereas, moreover, while in some cases there is freedom to take up and pursue small craft activities, in other cases there are stringent provisions making the taking up and pursuit of those activities subject to possession of formal qualifications;
Whereas the Council, at the time of approving the General Programmes, found that in respect of small craft industries co-ordination and recognition posed problems, the solution of which requires detailed preparation;
Whereas it is therefore not possible to effect the co-ordination provided for at the same time as the abolition of restrictions ; whereas such co-ordination must be effected at a later date;
Whereas, in the absence of immediate co-ordination, it nevertheless appears desirable to make it easier to attain freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of the activities in question by the adoption of transitional measures of the kind envisaged in the General Programmes ; whereas this should be done primarily in order to avoid causing exceptional difficulties for nationals of Member States in which the taking up of such activities is not subject to any conditions;
Whereas, in order to prevent such difficulties arising, the main object of the transitional measures should be to allow, as sufficient qualification for taking up the activities in question in host States which have rules governing the taking up of such activities, the fact that the occupation has been pursued for a  1 OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.  2 OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 32/62.  3 OJ No 182, 12.12.1963, p. 2895/63.  4 OJ No 117, 23.7.1964, p. 1869/64.  reasonable period of time in the country whence the person concerned comes, such period being, in cases where no previous training is required, sufficiently recent to ensure that such person possesses professional knowlege equivalent to that required of the host country's own nationals;
Whereas, as regards States which do not make the taking up of the activities in question subject to any rules, in order to avoid a disproportionate influx into those States of persons who are unable to satisfy the conditions laid down in respect of the taking up and pursuit of such activities in the country whence they come, provision should be made for those States to be authorised, where appropriate and in respect of one or more activities, to require nationals of other Member States to furnish proof that they are qualified to pursue the activity in question in the country whence they come;
Whereas, however, considerable caution should be exercised in granting such authorisations, for, if too generally applied, they might hinder freedom of movement ; whereas they should therefore be limited, both as to their period of validity and as to their scope, and, as is generally provided in the Treaty in respect of the administration of protective measures, the granting of such authorisations should be entrusted to the Commission;
Whereas the main purpose of the measures provided for in this Directive will disappear once the co-ordination of conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question and the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal evidence of qualifications has been achieved;","{'title': 'Council Directive 64/427/EEC of 7 July 1964 laying down detailed provisions concerning transitional measures in respect of activities of self-employed persons in manufacturing and processing industries falling within ISIC Major Groups 23-40 (Industry and small craft industries)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops (1), and in particular Articles 12 and 16 thereof,
Whereas Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 provides for the payment of an advance to producers applying for an oilseeds compensation payment; whereas that payment should be made once titlement thereto has been established by the Member  States;
Whereas Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 states that in order to qualify for the abovementioned advance payment, producers must fulfil certain obligations, including submitting an application with a detailed cultivation plan for the holding  showing areas sown to oilseeds; whereas the Commission has proposed an integrated administration and control system (2) providing in particular for a single aid application; whereas the fact that a decision has not yet been taken concerning that system  is not sufficient reason for delaying payment of advances to producers of winter rape meeting the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 at a time when the competent authorities in certain Member States could process such applications as of  now as experience gained in the previous support system for oilseeds introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3766/91 of 22 December 1991 establishing a support system for producers of soya beans, rape seed and colza seed and sunflower seed (3) shows;
Whereas only producers not opting for the simplified scheme referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 are entitled to apply for the oilseeds compensation payment provided for in Article 5 of that Regulation and accordingly to receive  advances on that payment; whereas such producers are accordingly required to set aside part of the land of their holdings;
Whereas the Commission continues to examine the regionalization plans presented by the Member States pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, some of which exist only in provisional form; whereas, as a consequence, the Commission cannot fix the  projected regional reference amount referred to in Article 5 (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92; whereas this situation should not, however, be allowed to affect the interests of rapeseed producers sowing in 1992 with a view to a harvest in 1993, and in  particular their possible entitlement to payment of advances;
Whereas Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 provides for specific measures to facilitate the transition from the system in force to that established by that Regulation; whereas, in view of the foregoing, detailed rules should be adopted as a  transitional measure for applications for advance for producers sowing winter rape in order to forestall difficulties relating to that crop; whereas it is sufficient under the circumstances for producers to provide minimum details, namely the total area  under winter rape, together with an undertaking to provide any other information required in due time;
Whereas certain aspects relating to the set-aside obligation, and in particular the set-aside declaration referred to in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2293/92 of 31 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council  Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 with regard to the set-aside scheme referred to in Article 7 (4), are still to be clarified; whereas, as a consequence, specific provisions ensuring that the producer's commitment to comply with that obligation in the future  are met should be adopted;
Whereas any change in the area sown to winter rape should give rise to a disproportionate number of specific checks to ascertain that entitlement to payment of the advance continues to apply; whereas such changes should therefore be limited to those  made inevitable by a failure to plant the crop on account of agronomical reasons or weather conditions; whereas in that case only new sowing of oilseeds enables the abovementioned difficulties to be avoided;

","COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2980/92  of 14 October 1992  opening an invitation to tender for the reduction in the levy on grain sorghum imported from third countries
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1799/87 of 25 June 1987 on special arrangements for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain from 1987 to 1991 (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3391/91 (2), and in particular Articles 3 (2) and 8  thereof,
Whereas, as part of an agreement with the United States of America, the Community has undertaken to import a certain quantity of grain sorghum into Spain in the years 1987 to 1991; whereas by Regulation (EEC) No 3919/91 (3), extending the measures taken  under the abovementioned agreement, the Council approved the extension of that agreement to 1992, that extension being without prejudice to the rights and obligations arising from the original agreement;
Whereas under the said rights and obligations Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3505/91 (4), opens invitations to tender for the reduction in the levy on imports of the quantities outstanding for 1991; whereas a closer estimate of those quantities calls  for a further invitation to tender to be opened;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1799/87, the levy reduction is to be applied to grain sorghum imported into Spain under cover of a licence valid in that Member State alone;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 of 5 March 1990 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the ACP States or in the overseas countries and  territories (OCT) (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 523/91 (6), provides in particular for a reduction of 60 % in the levy applicable to grain sorghum up to a quota of 100 000 tonnes per calendar year and of 50 % in excess of that quota;
Whereas, if that benefit is combined with the reduction provided for under this Regulation, this is likely to disturb the Spanish market for cereals; whereas such combined benefits should be ruled out for the sake of the satisfactory functioning of the  invitation to tender;
Whereas the specific additional rules required for administrating the invitation to tender should be laid down, including in particular rules on the lodging by operators and the release of securities against fulfilment of their obligations, and in  particular the obligation to process or use the imported product in Spain;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2980/92 of 14 October 1992 opening an invitation to tender for the reduction in the levy on grain sorghum imported from third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1010/2005
of 30 June 2005
amending Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 7 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) Following the initiation (2) of an anti-dumping investigation on 23 October 2004, the Commission imposed on 23 April 2005 by Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 (3) provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway (Regulation imposing a provisional duty).
(2) The provisional anti-dumping duties which took the form of ad valorem duties ranging between 6,8 % and 24,5 % of the value of the imported products apply as of 27 April 2005.
2.   FORM OF THE PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
(3) Anti-dumping measures may take different forms. For example, whereas the actual amount of an ad valorem duty varies in response to the import prices, the effect of a minimum import price is static in nature. The purpose of both forms of measures is to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. When choosing the form of the measure, the Commission has a wide discretion. In previous investigations of farmed salmon, duties based on a minimum import price sufficient to remove the effects of injurious dumping were the preferred form of the measures.
(4) However, in imposing provisional measures in the current case, the Commission provisionally considered that a minimum import price might be difficult to enforce and be more open to circumvention than other forms of measures. Therefore, in this investigation, provisional measures were originally imposed in the form of ad valorem duties.
(5) After the adoption of provisional measures, the Community market has seen a significant, unprecedented and unforeseeable rise in market prices for farmed salmon. The situation is aggravated by the fact that salmon is to a large extent traded as a fresh product with a short shelf-life. Thus, the excessive variations of market prices cannot be offset by stocking sufficient quantities of the product.
(6) In the specific circumstances of this case, the original considerations for not imposing minimum import prices are no longer present. Indeed, currently there is minimal risk that a minimum import price will be evaded, contrary to some experience in the past. However, the volatility now observed in the market would also suggest that this dramatic development is not of such a lasting nature as to put into question the findings of dumping and injury made with regard to the investigation period.
(7) Under these circumstances, it is considered appropriate to change the form of the measures to a minimum import price. As stated above, the purpose of the minimum price is the same as that of an ad valorem duty, i.e. to remove the effects of the injurious dumping.
(8) Where imports are undertaken at a cif Community border price equal to or above the minimum import price established, no duty would be payable. If imports are undertaken at a lower price, the difference between the actual price and the minimum import price established would become payable.
(9) As regards the level of the minimum import price necessary to remove the effects of the injurious dumping, the present amendment does not change the findings and methodology used in the Regulation imposing a provisional duty, in particular as set out in recitals 132 to 134 of that Regulation.
(10) As imports from Norway made at prices at or above the minimum import price will remove the effects of the injurious dumping, it is appropriate that the minimum price should apply to all imports from Norway.
(11) Farmed salmon is commonly traded in different presentations (gutted head on, gutted head off, whole fish fillets, other fillets or fillet portions). Therefore, when amending the existing duties into their new form, a non-injurious minimum import price level had to be established for each of these presentations, to reflect the added costs incurred in preparing each of them. In this respect, the different minimum import prices are based on the findings in previous anti-dumping investigations of the product concerned, as well as the findings in this investigation. They are essentially derived from the conversion factors, as contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 (4), and also used in this investigation.
(12) The exporting producers should be aware that if it is found that the measures are not effective, in particular, if the minimum import price is manipulated, absorbed or circumvented, the Commission may, after consulting the Advisory Committee, further amend Regulation (EC) No 628/2005, where appropriate, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the measures.
3.   DURATION OF THE MEASURES
(13) The provisional anti-dumping measures were originally imposed for a period of six months. Exporting producers representing a significant percentage of the trade involved have requested an extension of the provisional measures for a further period not exceeding three months.
(14) Therefore, and in accordance with Article 7(7) of the basic Regulation, it is decided to extend the duration of the provisional measures until 22 January 2006, inclusive.
4.   FINAL PROVISION
(15) In the interest of sound administration, and having regard to the fact that time-limits for comments had already been set in the Regulation imposing a provisional duty, a period should be fixed, within which the interested parties which made themselves known within the time-limit specified in the notice of initiation may make their views known in writing and request a hearing. Furthermore, it should be stated that the findings concerning the imposition of duties made for the purposes of this Regulation are provisional and may have to be reconsidered for the purpose of any definitive duty,","{'header': '1.7.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 170/32', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1010/2005\nof 30 June 2005\namending Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of farmed salmon originating in Norway', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1 of Regulation (EC) No 628/2005 is hereby replaced by the following:\n‘1.\xa0\xa0\xa0A provisional anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of farmed (other than wild) salmon, whether or not filleted, fresh, chilled or frozen, falling within CN codes ex\xa00302\xa012\xa000, ex\xa00303\xa011\xa000, ex\xa00303\xa019\xa000, ex\xa00303\xa022\xa000, ex\xa00304\xa010\xa013 and ex\xa00304\xa020\xa013 (hereinafter farmed salmon) originating in Norway.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Wild salmon shall not be subject to the provisional anti-dumping duty.

Whereas the markets and prices policy, based on modern farms, is the main instrument of the common agricultural policy; whereas full advantage cannot be drawn from such a policy unless it is integrated into an overall policy which includes a dynamic  social and structural policy and the application of the rules on competition contained in the Treaty;
Whereas, in many cases, surpluses can no longer be disposed of on normal terms either inside or outside the Community; whereas, in order to reduce the cost to the budget of disposing of surpluses on markets of third countries and to encourage greater  consumption within the Community, the restrictive price policy should continue to be applied; whereas, given the new intervention arrangement and further application of the stabilizing mechanism indicated in Article 4b (3) of Regulation (EEC) No  2727/75, this
aim may be achieved by maintaining for 1989/90 the intervention prices for common wheat, barley, rye, maize and sorghum applied during the previous marketing year;
Whereas, as part of a quality policy, production of common wheat of higher breadmaking quality and production of rye of breadmaking quality should be supported; whereas, accordingly, the special premiums for common wheat of breadmaking quality and for  rye of breadmaking quality should be continued; whereas, however, the level of these premiums should be ajusted in line with the further reduction in the intervention price provided for in Article 4b (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75;
Whereas in 1986/87 of Council began a process of aligning the intervention price of durum wheat on that of common wheat; whereas, in view of, on the one hand, the present ratio between the prices of those cereals and, on the other, the imbalance  recorded on the durum wheat market, it is advisable to pursue that process; whereas, accordingly, the intervention price of durum wheat should be further reduced;
Whereas application of Article 68 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal has meant that prices in Spain differ from the common prices; whereas, pursuant to Article 70 (1) of the Act of Accession, Spanish prices should be aligned with common  prices each year at the start of the marketing year; whereas the rules for this alignment give the Spanish intervention price for durum wheat indicated below; whereas, as a result of the changed made since accession in the intervention mechanisms and of  application of the stabilizing mechanisms, the Spanish intervention prices for barley, rye and sorghum should from the 1989/90 marketing year be the same as those applicable in the rest of the Community.","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1214/89 of 3 May 1989 fixing the prices applicable to cereals for the 1989/90 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 For the 1989/90 marketing year, the prices applicable in the cereals sector shall be as indicated in the Annex.', 'text': 'Article 1 For the 1989/90 marketing year, the prices applicable in the cereals sector shall be as indicated in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.', 'text': 'Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply from the beginning of the 1989/90 marketing year.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 3 May 1989.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nP.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 517/72 of 28 February 1972 on the introduction of common rules for regular and special regular services by coach and bus between Member States (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1301/78 (2), and in  particular Article 14 thereof,
Whereas Udo Bach of Reesendamm, 8, W - 2381 Busdorf, Germany (hereinafter referred to as 'Udo Bach'), submitted to the German authorities an application dated 14 July 1989 for authorization to introduce a special regular coach service between  Norderstedt, Germany, and Alicante, Spain, carrying passengers whose cars would be taken by vehicle transporters to the passengers' destination;
Whereas by letter of 4 June 1991, the German authorities asked the Commission to decide this application, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 517/72, since they had failed to reach agreement with the Spanish authorities on it;
Whereas the Commission organized a meeting on 20 November 1991 with representatives of the German and Spanish governments to resolve the difficulties posed by the application introduced by Udo Bach;
Whereas the applicant, supported by the German authorities, argues that there is no direct motor-rail link between North Germany and Alicante, in so far as the present link extends only to Narbonne, France, and that is over-subscribed; that the proposed  service would therefore reduce vehicle congestion and pollution by taking passengers and their cars off the roads on to the coach and accompanying vehicle transporter; and that this is a safer way to travel;
Whereas the Spanish authorities do not oppose the application in principle and are satisfied that the conditions set out in Article 8 (2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 517/72 concerning supply and demand are fulfilled; whereas they consider that a  Spanish operator should be allowed to participate, if interested;
Whereas there is a Spanish operator, Herederos de A. Tamame of Leopoldo Alas Clarin 16, Zamora, Spain (hereinafter referred to as 'Tamame'), who would be interested in running this service jointly with Udo Bach; and the Spanish authorities therefore  consider that, if the proposed service is authorized for the German operator, it should also be authorized for the Spanish operator;
Whereas the German authorities consider that the aforementioned Article 8 (3) should only apply when another operator has submitted an application at the same time as the one which is under consideration by the Member States concerned;
Whereas Udo Bach and Tamame have been unable to reach agreement on the joint operation of the proposed coach service between Norderstedt and Alicante;
Whereas it can be considered that there is a demand for the coach service proposed by Udo Bach in that there is no direct motor-rail link from the Hamburg area in Germany to Alicante in Spain, which is a major tourist route;
Whereas the introduction of new coach services which take private cars off the roads should be encouraged, since this is a safer mode of transport and is also environmentally friendly;
Whereas the French authorities, as a transit Member State, informed the Commission by a letter of 3 September 1991 that they had no objections to the service provided that it did not pick up or set down passengers in France and was only for passengers  whose cars were carried separately on vehicle transporters and that such carriage complied with the rules applicable to professional road haulage;
Whereas the minutes of the proceedings of the Mixed German-Spanish Committee which have been submitted by the Spanish authorities concern only a given service between Germany and a third country and do not contain a general agreement concerning the  authorization of regular services and special regular services to be operated between the two countries; whereas it is, therefore, not necessary to decide whether such an agreement between two Member States would be consistent with Regulation (EEC) No  517/72;
Whereas whilst the Commission appreciates that the interests of existing coach operators in participating in the running of a proposed service should be considered in accordance with Article 8 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 517/72, the negotiations between  Udo Bach and Tamame to operte this service jointly have not resulted in agreement;
Whereas the decision whether to run a coach service jointly is one which should be left to the commercial judgment of the operators concerned;
Whereas if Tamame wishes to run a similar service he may also apply for authorization to the appropriate authorities; whereas the Spanish authorities agree that they have not asked the German authorities to give their consent to an application made by  Tamame,","{'title': '92/405/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 July 1992 settling the dispute between Germany and Spain over the creation of a coach service (Only the German and Spanish texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nUdo Bach of Reesendamm, 8, W - 2381 Busdorf, Germany, shall be granted, by the competent authority, an authorization, valid for a two-year period, to operate a coach service between Norderstedt, Germany, and Alicante, Spain, exclusively for  passengers whose cars are transported separately.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100A thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the application of standardized organizational processes and conditions under which laboratory studies are planned, performed, recorded and reported for the non-clinical testing of chemicals for the protection of man, animals and the environment, hereinafter referred to as 'Good Laboratory Practice' (GLP), contributes to the reassurance of Member States as to the quality of the test data generated;
Whereas, in Annex 2 to its Decision on 12 May 1981 on the mutual acceptance of data in the assessment of chemicals, the council of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) adopted principles of good laboratory practice which are accepted within the Community and are specified in Council Directive 87/18/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the harmonization of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of the principles of good laboratory practice and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances (4);
Whereas, in the conduct of tests on chemicals, it is desirable that specialist manpower and testing laboratory resources should not be wasted owing to the need to duplicate tests because of differences in laboratory practices from one Member State to another; whereas this applies especially for animal protection which requires that the number of experiments on animals be restricted in accordance with Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes (5); whereas mutual recognition of the results of tests obtained using standard and recognized methods is an essential condition for reducing the number of experiments in this area;
Whereas, however, in order to ensure that test data generated by laboratories in one Member State are also recognized by other Member States, it is necessary to provide for a harmonized system for study audit and inspection of laboratories to ensure that they are working under GLP conditions;
Whereas Member States designate the authorities responsible for carrying out monitoring on compliance with GLP;
Whereas a committee, the members of which will be appointed by the Member States, would be of assistance to the Commission in the technical application of this Directive and would cooperate in its efforts to encourage the free movement of goods by the mutual recognition by Member States of procedures for monitoring compliance
with GLP; whereas the committee set up by Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (1), as last amended by Directive 87/432/EEC (2), may be used for this purpose;

However, the importation of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers, are still authorised from those regions of Russia not listed in Annex I to that Decision, subject to certain conditions, including those regions located west of the Ural mountains, in which outbreaks had not occurred at the date of adoption of Decision 2005/693/EC.
(4) On 19 October 2005, Russia informed the Commission that an outbreak of avian influenza has occurred in Tula, in the Central Federal District of Russia, in which no outbreaks had been previously reported and from which unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers may still be imported, in accordance with Decision 2005/693/EC.
(5) In relation to the recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by Influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 in Turkey, Romania and Russia, circumstantial evidence and molecular epidemiology data strongly suggest that the avian influenza virus has spread into those third countries proceeding from central Asia via migratory birds. This is also suggested by the report of a recent mission to Russia carried out by the World Organization for Animal Health (O.I.E.), that was published on 14 October 2005.
(6) The importation into the Community of unprocessed feathers and parts of unprocessed feathers should therefore be banned from those regions of Russia where the outbreak of avian influenza has recently occurred or which are at particular risk, in accordance with current knowledge on the flyways of migratory brids proceeding from the areas in central Asia and Siberia where the disease has been recorded.
(7) Annex I to Commission Decision 2005/693/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 23(5) in conjunction with Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 23(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Commission received on 28 December 2011 an application from Institut Technique de l'Agriculture Biologique (ITAB) for the approval of Equisetum arvense L. as basic substance. That application was accompanied by the information required by the second subparagraph of Article 23(3).
(2) The Commission asked the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) for scientific assistance. The Authority presented to the Commission a Technical report on the substance concerned on 24 May 2013 (2). The Commission presented the review report and this draft regulation on the approval of Equisetum arvense L. to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 20 March 2014.
(3) The documentation provided by the applicant and the results of examination carried out by the Authority (3) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) show that Equisetum arvense L. fulfils the criteria of a foodstuff as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Moreover, it is not predominantly used for plant protection purposes but nevertheless is useful in plant protection in a product consisting of the substance and water. Consequently, it is to be considered as a basic substance.
(4) As the basic substance concerned is a foodstuff not requiring a specific authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is deemed to be evaluated as having neither an immediate or delayed harmful effect on human or animal health nor an unacceptable effect on the environment.
(5) It has appeared from the examinations made that Equisetum arvense L. may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is necessary to include certain conditions for the approval which are detailed in Annex I to this Regulation.
(6) In accordance with Article 23(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, basic substances are to be listed separately in the Regulation referred to in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is therefore appropriate to add a Part C in the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (6). That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 21 June 2013
abrogating Decision 2009/590/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Romania
(2013/318/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 7 July 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided, in Decision 2009/590/EC (1), that an excessive deficit existed in Romania. The Council noted that the general government deficit reached 5,4 % of GDP in 2008, thus above the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value, while the general government gross debt was 13,6 % of GDP, well below the 60 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value (2).
(2) On 7 July 2009, in accordance with Article 104(7) TEC and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (3), the Council, based on a recommendation from the Commission, addressed a Recommendation to Romania with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2011(‘Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009’). The Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009 was made public.
(3) On 12 February 2010, in accordance with Article 126(7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, the Council, based on a recommendation from the Commission, acknowledging that the Romanian authorities had taken effective action in compliance with the Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009 and that unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances had occurred in Romania, addressed a revised Recommendation to Romania with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2012. This revised Recommendation was made public.
(4) In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt, and other associated variables, twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4).
(5) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit ought to be abrogated, the Council has to take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission services forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 %-of-GDP threshold over the forecast horizon.
(6) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat), in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, following the notification by Romania before 1 April 2013 and on the Commission services' 2013 spring forecast, the following conclusions are justified:
— The larger-than-expected recession in 2009 resulted in a significant shortfall in government revenue, which pushed the general government deficit to 9 % of GDP despite efforts to reduce government expenditure. Following this unexpected development and the extension of the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit by one year, the general government deficit was subsequently reduced to 6,8 % of GDP in 2010, to 5,6 % of GDP in 2011 and to 2,9 % of GDP in 2012, which is below the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value. The correction of the deficit has been driven mainly by strict control of expenditure growth, including through control of the public sector wage bill, a freeze in pensions and a reduction in all social benefits except pensions. It was also supported by revenue measures such as an increase in the VAT rates by 5 percentage points and a broadening of the personal income tax base. The fiscal adjustment was implemented in the context of two consecutive economic adjustment programmes supported by balance-of-payments assistance.
— The Convergence Programme for 2012 to 2016 projects the deficit to continue falling to 2,4 % of GDP in 2013 and 2,0 % of GDP in 2014. In the Commission services' 2013 spring forecast, the general government deficit is projected to decrease to 2,6 % of GDP in 2013 and to 2,4 % of GDP in 2014, based on a no-policy-change assumption, which remains below the Treaty reference value.
— The Commission services 2013 spring forecast projects the general government gross debt to increase slightly from 37,8 % of GDP in 2012 to 38,5 % of GDP in 2014.
(7) Starting from 2013, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, Romania should progress towards its medium-term budgetary objective at an appropriate pace, including respecting the expenditure benchmark.
(8) In accordance with Article 126(12) TFEU, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(9) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in Romania has been corrected and Decision 2009/590/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '26.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 173/50', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 21 June 2013\nabrogating Decision 2009/590/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Romania\n(2013/318/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 7 July 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided, in Decision 2009/590/EC(1), that an excessive deficit existed in Romania.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and in particular Article 4(3) thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and in particular Article 42 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (1) lays down general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on hazard analysis and critical control points principles. It provides that food business operators are to comply with the structural requirements based on those principles. Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2) supplements the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. The rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 include specific requirements for milk processing establishments, as well as hygiene requirements concerning raw milk and dairy products.
(2) Romania is due to accede to the Community on 1 January 2007. In preparation for that accession, milk processing establishments are undergoing the necessary structural improvements in order to comply with the structural requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. Since 2004 the number of establishments in compliance with Community structural requirements has increased from 12 to 123.
(3) However, the proportion of raw milk that complies with the hygiene requirements, laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, delivered to milk processing establishments that comply with the structural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 has only increased slightly. In 2005 out of the total production of 5,6 Mio t raw cow milk per year, 0,38 Mio t compliant raw milk was delivered to milk processing establishments.
(4) Taking into account the current situation, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures as regards the organisation of the milk sector in Romania.
(5) In this respect, Annex VII, Chapter 5, Subsection I, point (c) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, authorises temporarily certain milk processing establishments that do not comply with the structural requirements laid down in Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 to receive deliveries of raw milk that does not comply with the relevant hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (‘non-compliant milk’).
(6) Milk production holdings that do not comply with the hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and milk processing establishments that do comply with the structural requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 are spread over the whole territory of Romania. Accordingly, certain of the compliant establishments receive raw milk that complies with the relevant hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (‘compliant milk’) as well as non-compliant milk. Therefore, the marketing of final products from the compliant establishments should be restricted to Romania. In addition, a list of those compliant establishments should be set out in this Decision.
(7) Furthermore, certain compliant establishments intend to process separately compliant and non-compliant milk. It is therefore necessary to establish the conditions as regards the collection and treatment of such milk and the marketing of the final products thereof. A list of those compliant establishments processing those two types of milk should also be set out in this Decision.
(8) The transitional period granted should be limited to 18 months. The situation of the milk sector in Romania is to be reviewed before the end of that period. Accordingly, it is appropriate that Romania submit annual reports to the Commission regarding progress in the upgrading of milk production holdings supplying raw milk to compliant establishments.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '13.1.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 8/45', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 December 2006\nadopting certain transitional measures concerning deliveries of raw milk to processing establishments and the processing of this raw milk in Romania with regard to the requirements of Regulation (EC) Nos 852/2004 and 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of Council\n(notified under document number C(2006) 6963)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/27/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs(1)lays down general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on hazard analysis and critical control points principles.

In 2005 out of the total production of 5,6 Mio t raw cow milk per year, 0,38 Mio t compliant raw milk was delivered to milk processing establishments.\n\n((4)) Taking into account the current situation, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures as regards the organisation of the milk sector in Romania.\n\n((5)) In this respect, Annex VII, Chapter 5, Subsection I, point (c) of the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, authorises temporarily certain milk processing establishments that do not comply with the structural requirements laid down in Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 to receive deliveries of raw milk that does not comply with the relevant hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (‘non-compliant milk’).\n\n((6)) Milk production holdings that do not comply with the hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 and milk processing establishments that do comply with the structural requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 are spread over the whole territory of Romania. Accordingly, certain of the compliant establishments receive raw milk that complies with the relevant hygiene requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 (‘compliant milk’) as well as non-compliant milk. Therefore, the marketing of final products from the compliant establishments should be restricted to Romania. In addition, a list of those compliant establishments should be set out in this Decision.\n\n((7)) Furthermore, certain compliant establishments intend to process separately compliant and non-compliant milk. It is therefore necessary to establish the conditions as regards the collection and treatment of such milk and the marketing of the final products thereof. A list of those compliant establishments processing those two types of milk should also be set out in this Decision.\n\n((8)) The transitional period granted should be limited to 18 months. The situation of the milk sector in Romania is to be reviewed before the end of that period. Accordingly, it is appropriate that Romania submit annual reports to the Commission regarding progress in the upgrading of milk production holdings supplying raw milk to compliant establishments.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1',

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats [1], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1562/78 [2], and in particular Article 16 (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2749/78 of 23 November 1978 on trade in oils and fats between the Community and Greece [3], and in particular Article 5 (6) thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75 of 25 July 1975 [4], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3020/75 [5], laid down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for oils and fats; whereas the special provisions necessary for the application of the system of levies fixed by tender in the olive oil sector need to be added to that Regulation;
Whereas those special provisions either complement or derogate from those of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 193/75 of 17 January 1975 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products [6], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1624/78 [7];
Whereas, under Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2751/78 of 23 November 1978 laying down general rules for fixing the import levy on olive oil by tender [8], tenderers must submit an application for an import licence on the dates fixed by the Commission; whereas, for ease of administration these applications should be submitted in such a way that the minimum levy is calculated once a week;
Whereas the special security should be fixed at a level permitting the system for fixing the levy by tender to function properly; whereas, for the sake of administrative simplicity, this special security should replace that provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75;
Whereas all imports of the products in question become subject to the tendering procedure from the time when the Commission decides to apply it;
Whereas, under Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75, no application for an import licence is required in respect of imports of products in the olive oil sector not exceeding 100 kilograms, although such imports remain subject to the levy; whereas, for the sake of administrative simplicity, this provision should be retained;
Whereas in certain Member States traders import only small quantities; whereas, if such traders had to submit their offers under the tendering procedure, the administrative burden on the competent bodies in the Member States would be increased without any improvement in their knowledge of the market situation; whereas the tendering procedure should apply only to applications for licences relating to quantities of a product in excess of 20000 kilograms;
Whereas, in order to avoid any risk of disturbance of the Community market, a levy should be charged in the two cases referred to above; whereas imports not exceeding 21000 kilograms should be made subject to the minimum levy applicable on the day of importation for each category of olive oil in question; whereas, in order to ensure that the levy system functions correctly, the number of applications for licences in respect of the quantities referred to above which may be submitted by any one importer should be limited; whereas to this same end such licences should be made non-transferable;
Whereas, under Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2041/75, import licences applied for otherwise than under the tendering procedure are subject to a waiting period of four days; whereas experience has shown that such applications for licences are rare; whereas the abovementioned waiting period is therefore unnecessary;
Whereas, when olive oils or olives intended for the production of oil are covered either by the arrangements provided for in Council Directive 69/73/EEC of 4 March 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of inward processing [9], as last amended by Directive 76/119/EEC [10], or by the system described in Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 645/75 of 13 March 1975 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the export levies and charges on agricultural products [11], special provisions should be laid down to take account of the existence of a system of fixing levies by tender in the olive oil sector;
Whereas, in view of the relaxation of the arrangements applicable to the import of small quantities, it is desirable to monitor more closely trade movements in respect of such quantities; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 205/73 on communications between Member States and the Commission concerning oils and fats [12], as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2413/77 [13], should therefore be amended;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3136/78 of 28 December 1978 laying down detailed rules for fixing the import levy on olive oil by tender', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 15 May 2007
opening and providing for the administration of a tariff quota for poultrymeat allocated to the United States of America
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the United States of America pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedules of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic, in the course of their accession to the European Union (2), approved by Council Decision 2006/333/EC (3), provides for the integration of a specific tariff quota allocated to the United States for imports of 16 665 tonnes of poultry.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (5) should apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1232/2006 of 16 August 2006 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota of poultrymeat allocated to the United States of America (6) has to be amended substantially. Regulation (EC) No 1232/2006 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.
(4) In order to maintain a regular flow of imports, the quota period from 1 July to 30 June of the following year should be subdivided into a number of sub-periods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.
(5) The tariff quota should be administered on the basis of import licences. To that end, detailed rules for the submission of applications and the information which must appear in applications and licences should be laid down.
(6) In the light of the risk of speculation that is inherent in the system in question in the poultrymeat sector, precise conditions should be laid down as regards operators' access to the tariff quota arrangements.
(7) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.
(8) In the interest of the operators, the Commission should establish the quantities that have not been applied for, which are to be carried over to the following sub-period in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.
(9) Access to the tariff quota should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of origin issued by the authorities of the United States in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (7).

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 787/89 (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 provides that interest charges to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section for funds used for the buying-in of products are, in the case of funds originating in the Member States, to be calculated using a method and an interest rate uniform throughout the Community and whereas that interest rate must be representative of interest rates actually paid;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 411/88 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 439/89 (4), lays down the method and the interest rate to be applied for the calculation of the financing costs mentioned above;
Whereas the interest rates for short-term and long-term financing vary considerably depending on the Member State; whereas a weighting of those interest rates used hitherto has not given satisfactory results;
Whereas the interest rates recorded in recent years for the ecu increasingly reflect the interest rates, subject to a weighting, for currencies which make up the ecu and whereas the interest rates for the ecu may thus be considered representative of interest charges in the Community;
Whereas, in view of the time limits for the financing of capital invested in intervention stocks, the uniform interest rate should reflect the three months' and 12 months' forward rates;
Whereas Article 4 of that Regulation should stipulate the specific rules to be applied for a Member State bearing interest charges lower than those resulting from the application of the uniform interest rates;

of 25 March 2004
fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 7800 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 8(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003(3) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 563/2004 of 25 March 2004 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWith the exception of the quantity of 7800 tonnes provided for in the Annex, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 26 March 2004.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 March 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Decision 90/424/EEC the Community is to undertake or assist the Member States in undertaking the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.
(2) The International Committee of the International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE) adopted Resolution No XIV on 29 May 2002, including animal welfare in its work-plan for the next five years.
(3) The International Committee of the OIE adopted Resolution No XXVI on 20 May 2003, recommending that a global conference on animal welfare (the OIE Global Conference) be organised in 2004 and that OIE Member States support the organisation of that conference.
(4) The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on animal welfare legislation on farmed animals in third countries and the implications for the EU(3) (the Communication from the Commission) suggested that the Commission with all Member States should continue fully to support and follow up on the OIE initiative.
(5) The Council (Agriculture) in December 2002 adopted specific conclusions on animal welfare concerning mutual assistance in connection with control and international aspects(4).

Whereas:

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (‘the basic Regulation’) (1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee in accordance with Articles 11(4) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST
(1) The European Commission (‘the Commission’) has received a request for a ‘new exporter’ review under Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.
(2) The request was lodged on 3 May 2013 by Ningbo Logitrans Handling Equipment Co., Ltd (‘the applicant’), an exporting producer of hand pallet trucks and their essential parts in the People’s Republic of China (‘the country concerned’).
B.   PRODUCT
(3) The product under review is hand pallet trucks and their essential parts, i.e. chassis and hydraulics, currently falling within CN codes ex 8427 90 00 (TARIC codes 8427900011 and 8427900019) and ex 8431 20 00 (TARIC codes 8431200011 and 8431200019) and originating in the People’s Republic of China.
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(4) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011 (2) as amended by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2013 (3), under which imports into the Union of the product under review, including the product produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 70,8 %. The measures are also applicable to imports of hand pallet trucks and their essential parts consigned from Thailand whether declared as originating in Thailand or not pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 499/2009 (4).
D.   GROUNDS
(5) The applicant claims that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
(6) It further claims that it did not export the product under review to the Union during the investigation period on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (‘the original investigation period’).
(7) Furthermore, the applicant claims that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product under review which are subject to the above-mentioned anti-dumping measures.
(8) The applicant further claims that it has begun exporting the product under review to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.
E.   PROCEDURE
(9) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product under review into the Union shall be subject. Upon receipt of the claim for market economy treatment, it will be determined whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
(10) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable under Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011 as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2013.
(a)   Questionnaires
(11) In order to obtain information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
(13) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the request for a review and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(14) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Market economy treatment
(15) If the applicant provides sufficient evidence that it operates under market economy conditions, i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. For this purpose, duly substantiated claims must be submitted within the specific time limit set in Article 4 of this Regulation. The Commission will send a claim form to the applicant, as well as to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China.
(d)   Selection of the market economy country
(16) If the applicant is not granted market economy treatment, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value for the People’s Republic of China in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. The Commission envisages using Brazil for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports from the People’s Republic of China. Interested parties are invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4 of this Regulation.
(17) If the applicant is granted market economy treatment but reliable required data are not available in the People’s Republic of China, the Commission may, if necessary, also use findings concerning the normal value established in an appropriate market-economy country, e.g. for the purpose of replacing any unreliable cost or price elements in the People’s Republic of China which are needed in establishing the normal value. The Commission envisages using Brazil also for this purpose.
F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(18) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product under review which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied from the date of the registration of these imports. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the investigation.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(19) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit any information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,
— interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of the use of Brazil as explained in recitals 16 and 17 above,
— the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy treatment.
(20) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(21) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(22) If an interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.
(23) If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
(24) Failure to give a computerised response shall not be deemed to constitute non-cooperation, provided that the interested party shows that presenting the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden or unreasonable additional cost. The interested party should immediately contact the Commission.
I.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION
(25) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.
J.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(26) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5).
K.   HEARING OFFICER
(27) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested party’s rights of defence are being fully exercised. The Hearing Officer will provide opportunities for a hearing involving parties which would allow different views to be presented and rebuttal arguments offered.
(28) A request for a hearing with the Hearing Officer should be made in writing within the specific deadlines set by the Commission in its communication with the parties. The party should specify the reasons for the request.
(29) For further information and contact details interested parties may consult the Hearing Officer’s web pages on the Directorate-General for Trade’s website: http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/degucht/contact/hearing-officer/","{'header': '15.1.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 10/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 32/2014\nof 14 January 2014\ninitiating a ‘new exporter’ review of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of hand pallet trucks and their essential parts originating in the People’s Republic of China as amended by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2013, repealing the duty with regard to imports of one exporter in this country and making such imports subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nA review of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011 as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2013 is hereby initiated under Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 in order to determine if and to what extent the imports of hand pallet trucks and their essential parts, currently falling within CN codes ex\xa08427\xa090\xa000  (TARIC codes 8427\xa090\xa000\xa011 and 8427\xa090\xa000\xa019) and ex\xa08431\xa020\xa000  (TARIC codes 8431\xa020\xa000\xa011 and 8431\xa020\xa000\xa019) and originating in the People’s Republic of China, produced and sold for export to the Union by Ningbo Logitrans Handling Equipment Co., Ltd (TARIC additional code A070) should be subject to the anti-dumping duty imposed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1008/2011 as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 372/2013 or that an individual anti-dumping duty should be imposed.\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, hand pallet trucks shall be trucks with wheels supporting lifting fork arms for handling pallets, designed to be manually pushed, pulled and steered, on smooth, level, hard surfaces, by a pedestrian operator using an articulated tiller.

Whereas Article 11 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (4) stipulates that, as from 23 July 1992, products which are imported from a third country may be marketed only where they originate in a third country appearing in a list to be drawn up in  accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the said Regulation; whereas Article 11 (2) specifies the conditions which have to be met for a third country to be inlcuded in the list;
Whereas it has become apparent that, due to the absence of information submitted to date by third countries, it will not be possible to decide on the entry of those countries in the list within the abovementioned time limit;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 16 (3) of the Regulation provides for the possibility to delay the implementation of Article 11 only where a third country has submitted a request for entry in the list in due time before the abovementioned  time limit;
Whereas these provisions could lead to interruption of imports of products where a third country has not submitted in due time a request for entry in the list referred to in Article 11 (1) (a);
Whereas interruptions of imports from third countries of products satisfying the conditions specified in Article 11 (2) should be avoided, in particular because these products may be necessary for the proper preparation of composite products;
Whereas, therefore, pending the inclusion of a third country in the list referred to in Article 11 (1) (a), importers should be able to obtain authorization to import from third countries products shown to comply with production rules and inspection  arrangements equivalent to those provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2083/92 of 14 July 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. the following paragraph shall be added to Article 11:\n\n'6.

(2) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market or on the Community import market for the product.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 2009/156/EC lays down animal health conditions for the importation into the Union of live equidae. It provides, amongst others, that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from third countries which have been free for six months from glanders.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC (3) establishes a list of third countries and parts of territories thereof from which Member States are to authorise the temporary admission of registered horses, the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export and the imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production and sets out the conditions for the importation of equidae from third countries.
(3) Following the detection of glanders in Kuwait in 2010 the Commission, by adopting Commission Decision 2010/776/EU (4), suspended the importation of registered horses from Kuwait. Kuwait has now submitted information demonstrating that the disease was successfully eradicated and that since the last case was confirmed on 19 December 2010 ongoing surveillance in the entire equine population has not revealed new cases.
(4) Because more than six months have elapsed after the last case of glanders in Kuwait, it is appropriate to authorise the temporary admission, re-entry after temporary export and imports of registered horses from that country. Therefore, the entry for Kuwait in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should be amended accordingly.
(5) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) and Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 21 thereof,

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 on the common organization of the market in certain products listed in Annex II to the Treaty (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3911/87 (8), and in particular Article 5 thereof, and Regulation No 26 applying certain rules of competition to production of and trade in agricultural products (9), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments (10), in accordance with Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty,
Whereas in view of the following:
I
At the end of 1986 the Commission decided to scrutinize all set-purpose charges levied in the Member States in agriculture and fishing and the allocation of those charges, in particular as aid. A standard form letter was accordingly sent to each Member State in 1987 in order to obtain the information required. By letter of 19 November 1987 the Belgian authorities responded to that request. By telex on 18 April 1988 the Commission asked the Belgian authorities to provide additional information; by letter of 17 May 1988 the said authorities responded to that request.
The measures in question were introduced by the Law of 11 April 1983 and the implementing Royal Decree of 31 January 1985, as amended by the Royal Decree of 23 April 1986. These provide for the setting up of a system whereby the promotion of outlets for the products concerned is financed by means of compulsory contributions. According to the information provided by the Belgian authorities the aid is granted for advertising, displays at fairs and exhibitions, market studies, attendance at international conferences, etc.
The said compulsory contributions levied, in respect of both imports and exports, by the ONDAH (Office national des dĂŠbouchĂŠs agricoles et horticoles) on the internal market. They are levied on a quantitative or ad valorem basis, according to the circumstances. Royal Decrees specify the contributions payable.
The Belgian authorities also pointed out that the revenue from the scheme is supplemented by a State subsidy, namely a part of the contribution paid by the central government to the ONDAH to promote outlets for agricultural products.
II
By letter of 15 July 1987 the Commission notified the Belgian Government that it had decided to initiate in respect of the aid the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty, on the grounds that they were partly financed by charges which in their effect were equivalent to customs duties.
In accordance with that procedure the Commission gave notice to the Belgian Government to submit its comments.
The Commission also gave notice to the other Member States and interested parties other than Member States to submit their comments.
III
By letter of 17 October 1988 the Belgian authorities informed the Commission that:
- on the specific aspect of charges, the contributions had been made payable in respect of imports with a view to ensuring fairness but that, for technical reasons, they had not been levied on imports or exports of beef and veal or pigmeat,
- they wished to challenge the description of the charges in question as having an effect equivalent to customs duties, and
- on the specific aspect of aid, all publicity campaigns conducted by the ONDAH complied with the negative and positive criteria set out in the guidelines in respect of national aid and publicity.
By telex of 24 February 1989, however, the Belgian authorities notified the Commission of a draft Royal Decree discontinuing the charges which had led to a procedure being initiated as described in II above. They accordingly asked the Commission to postpone a decision for six weeks pending the adoption of the draft Royal Decree. When that time limit expired the said Decree had not been adopted.
IV
The Belgian authorities have not fulfilled their obligations pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, firstly by failing to submit a draft of the measures to the Commission.
The aids, which are financed by compulsory contributions and the State's contribution, are likely to affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty by encouraging the sectors concerned.
The aid is, however, in keeping with the framework for national aid for the advertising of agricultural products and certain products not listed in Annex II to the EEC Treaty, excluding fishery products (1). It is likely to facilitate the development of the sectors concerned without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest and, accordingly, could conceivably be granted exemption pursuant to Article 92 (3) (c) of the Treaty. However, this must be ruled out since some of the aid could be financed by charges which run counter to the obligations set out in Article 12 et seq. of the Treaty.
According to a precedent of the Court of Justice the financing of a State aid by a compulsory set-purpose charge is an essential component of that aid and the assessment of the latter in the light of Community law should take into account both the aid itself and its financing.
In that respect the following should be borne in mind:
- in the pigmeat sector:
- the charge of 0,04 % ad valorem on exports of pigs, as specified in the first subparagraph of Article 4 (5) of the Royal Decree of 23 April 1986 should be regarded as a charge having an effect equivalent to customs duty, in that the basic taxable amount concerned is not comparable with the Bfrs 5 charge per pig slaughtered,
- the Bfrs 20 charge per exported pig weighing less than 50 kg and intended for rearing and fattening, and the Bfrs 100 charge per exported pig weighing more than 50 kg, as specified in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 4 (5) of the Royal Decree of 23 April 1986, should be regarded as charges having an effect equivalent to customs duty since they apply specifically to exports,
- in the beef and veal sector:
- the charge of 0,04 % ad valorem on imported meat (beef and veal) provided for in Article 5 (5) of the Royal Decree of 23 April 1986 should be regarded as a charge having an effect equivalent to customs duty in that the basic taxable amount concerned is not comparable with the contribution of Bfrs 30 per slaughtered adult bovine animal or Bfrs 15 per slaughtered calf,
- the charge of 0,04 % ad valorem on each exported live adult bovine animal or each exported live calf, with the exception of breeding animals, as provided for in Article 5 (7) of the Royal Decree of 23 April 1986 should be regarded as a charge having an effect equivalent to customs duty on exports, since the basic taxable amount concerned is not comparable with the contribution of Bfrs 30 per slaughtered adult bovine animal or Bfrs 15 per slaughtered calf,
- the charge of Bfrs 250 per exported bovine animal for breeding and the charge of Bfrs 1 per exported dose of semen should be regarded as charges having an effect equivalent to customs duty, since they apply specifically to exported products.
Since, on the basis of the information available, the aid financed by the contributions which are referred to above and which run counter to Article 12 of the EEC Treaty cannot be distinguished from that financed by other contributions and the State grant, all aid financed by the ONDAH by virtue of Article 1 of the Law of 11 April 1983 in the pigmeat, sheepmeat, goatmeet and horsemeat sectors, except in the case of horses intended for slaughter or the production of horsemeat, cannot be regarded as compatible with the common market must therefore be discontinued,","{'title': '90/362/EEC: Commission Decision of 17 May 1989 concerning a fund to encourage the marketing of pigmeat, beef and veal, sheepmeat, goatmeat and horsemeat (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Belgian Government shall grant no further aid to the pigmeat, beef and veal, sheepmeat, goatmeat and horsemeat sectors (not including horses intended for slaughter or horsemeat production) under the scheme introduced by the Law of 11 April 1983 and the Royal Decree of 23 January 1986, unless it first amends the said scheme so that it no longer infringes Article 12 of the EEC Treaty.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Belgian Government shall inform the Commission, within two months from notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to ensure compliance with this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 17 May 1989.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nRay MAC SHARRY\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 129, 11. 5. 1989, p. 12.\n\n(3) OJ No L 148, 28. 6. 1968, p. 24.\n\n(4) OJ No L 61, 4. 3. 1989, p. 43.\n\n(5) OJ No L 183, 16. 7. 1980, p. 1.\n\n(6) OJ No L 110, 29. 4. 1988, p. 36.\n\n(7) OJ No L 151, 30. 6. 1968, p. 16.\n\n(8) OJ No L 370, 30. 12. 1987, p. 36.\n\n(9) OJ No 30, 20. 4. 1962, p. 993/62.\n\n(10) OJ No C 31, 7. 2. 1989, p. 4.\n\n(1) OJ No C 302, 12. 11. 1987, p. 4.'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (1), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 390c of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (2), as stated in point (2)(e) under the heading ‘8. Taxation’ of the Annex V referred to in Article 18 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Croatia and the adjustments to the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (3), Croatia may, in accordance with the conditions applying in that Member State on the date of its accession, continue to exempt the supply of building land, with or without buildings built on it, as referred to in point (j) of Article 135(1) and in point (9) of Annex X, Part B of Directive 2006/112/EC, non-renewable, until 31 December 2014 and the international transport of passengers, as referred to in point (10) of Annex X, Part B of Directive 2006/112/EC, for as long as the same exemption is applied in any of the Member States which were members of the Union before the accession of Croatia; these transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT resources base.
(2) Croatia has requested authorisation from the Commission to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2014 since it is unable to make the precise calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point (9) of Annex X, Part B of Directive 2006/112/EC. Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Croatia’s total VAT own resources base. Croatia is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions.

(2) Given the degree of veterinary supervision and the fact that the horses concerned are kept separate from animals of lower health status, the period of temporary export should be extended to less than 90 days and the animal health conditions and the veterinary certification should accordingly be laid down for the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export to participate in specific horse races, competitions or cultural events taking place in Canada or the United States of America.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 16a of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 provides that if surpluses arise the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may take appropriate action on production potential; whereas the market in hops is at present in surplus, for both short-term and structural reasons;
Whereas the aim of producer groups is to adjust production to market requirements; whereas they may use up to 20 % of the aid on appropriate measures to that end; whereas their scope for action in this area should be extended by allowing them to have recourse to temporary resting and/or permanent grubbing-up of areas under hops; whereas these measures will be additional to the special measures listed in Article 7(1)(b) of the abovementioned Regulation;
Whereas the production and marketing conditions for hops and thus also the economic viability of the sector differ from one Member State to another; whereas, for this reason, the decision to apply or not to apply the special measures should be taken at the level of the Member State concerned;
Whereas temporary resting and/or permanent grubbing-up can be permitted only if certain requirements are met, in particular non-cumulation of aid for areas temporarily rested and an obligation to reduce areas by 2002; whereas this will entail costs; whereas these costs, and loss of income, should be met in part by payment of an amount equal to the aid per hectare for a limited period; whereas provision should be made that temporary granting of an amount equal to the aid on such unharvested areas may therefore be permitted; whereas for effectiveness of supervision the minimum size of the areas which can benefit from these measures should be specified;
Whereas for the sake of effective control of the application of these measures the responsibilities of producer groups and of the Member States' competent authorities should be defined, and the power of adopting detailed rules of application should be given to the Commission,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/98 of 25 May 1998 introducing special temporary measures for hops', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn addition to the aims described in Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 producer groups may also have recourse to temporary resting and/or permanent grubbing-up as means of jointly adjusting their production to market requirements and improving it.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 of 9 March 1998 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community (1), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 384/2005 of 7 March 2005 adopting the programme of ad hoc modules, covering the years 2007 to 2009, to the labour force sample survey provided by Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 (2) includes an ad hoc module on accidents at work and work-related health problems.
(2) Council Resolution No 2002/C 161/01 of 3 June 2002 on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work (2002-2006) (3) called on the Commission and the Member States to step up work in hand on harmonisation of statistics on accidents at work and occupational illnesses, so as to have available comparable data from which to make an objective assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the measures taken under the new Community strategy.
(3) Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (4), states that employers must keep a list of occupational accidents resulting in a worker being unfit for work for more than three working days and must draw up, for the responsible authorities and in accordance with national laws and/or practices, reports on occupational accidents suffered by his workers. In its Recommendation 2003/670/EC of 19 September 2003 concerning the European schedule of occupational diseases (5), the Commission recommended that Member States should ensure that all cases of occupational diseases are reported and should progressively make their statistics on occupational diseases compatible with the European schedule, in accordance with the work being done on the system of harmonising European statistics on occupational diseases. The Commission Communication of 11 March 2002 on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006 (6) underlines that the statistical information should cover not just recognised occupational accidents and illnesses, their causes and consequences, but should also introduce some quantifiable elements relating to working environment factors which are likely to cause the problems. Statistical data should also be available for emerging phenomena, like stress-related complaints or musculoskeletal problems.
(4) It is also necessary to update the specification of the sample set out in Section 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 384/2005, in order to ensure that the sample available for analysis in the ad hoc module is as revealing as possible.

Whereas a list of establishments in the Republic of South Africa and Namibia, approved for the purpose of importing fresh meat into the Community, was drawn up initially by Commission Decision 82/913/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 83/356/EEC (4);

Whereas, to this end, it is necessary, for the last mentioned establishments, to fix a final date for the introduction into Community territory of meat originating in them, after which date the unloading of meat shall in no case be authorized therefrom;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, originating in the German Democratic Republic.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the exporter of the product concerned made his views known in writing and requested an opportunity to be heard by the Commission which was granted.
C. Dumping
(3) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty, therefore the Commission confirms its findings on the dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 to be definitive.
D. Injury
(4) No fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry has been submitted, therefore the Commission confirms the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84.
E. Community interest
(5) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken.
F. Undertaking
(6) The exporter concerned was informed of the main findings of the investigation and commented on them. An undertaking was subsequently offered by the exporter concerning his exports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, to the Community.
(7) This undertaking was considered acceptable by the Commission and the proceeding is therefore being terminated without imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty.
G. Definitive collection of the provisional duties
(8) The Commission considers that the dumped imports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, originating in the German Democratic Republic, have caused material injury to the Community industry concerned. Therefore the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty should be definitively collected in their entirety.
(9) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2434/84 of 23 August 1984 collecting definitively the amounts secured by way of provisional duty in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain angles, shapes and sections, of iron or steel, originating in the German Democratic Republic', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe amounts secured by way of a provisional anti-dumping duty under Regulation (EEC) No 1129/84 shall be definitively collected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 August 1984.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1206/90 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2202/90 (4) lays down general rules for the system of production aid for processed fruit and vegetables;
Whereas, under Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, the minimum price to be paid to producers is to be determined on the basis of, firstly, the minimum price applying during the previous marketing year, secondly, the movement of basic prices in  the fruit and vegetable sector, and thirdly, the need to ensure the normal marketing of fresh products for the various uses, including supply of the processing industry;
Whereas Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 provides that the minimum price to be paid to producers for unprocessed dried figs shall be increased each month during a certain period of the marketing year by an amount corresponding to storage  costs; whereas, in fixing this amount, the technical storage costs and interest cost should be taken into consideration;

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of copper chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) From the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) adopted on 12 November 2009 (2) read in combination with that of 16 April 2008 (3) it results that copper chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. According to the opinion of 16 April 2008, the use of that preparation may be considered as a source of available copper and fulfils the criteria of a nutritional additive for all animal species. The Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1253/2008 of 15 December 2008 concerning the authorisation of copper chelate of hydroxy analogue of methionine as a feed additive (4) that preparation was already authorised as a feed additive for chickens for fattening. That Regulation should be repealed.

suspending the application of import duties on certain quantities of industrial sugar for the 2006/2007 marketing year
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 40(1)(c) and (e)(i) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 26(3) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, in order to guarantee the supply necessary for the production of the products referred to in Article 13(2) of that Regulation, the Commission may suspend in whole or in part for certain quantities the application of import duties on sugar.
(2) In order to guarantee the supply necessary for the production of the products referred to in Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, it is in the interest of the Community to suspend completely the application of import duties on industrial sugar intended for the production of those products for the 2006/07 marketing year.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (2) applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. In particular, in order to ensure fluid supply to the Community market, it is appropriate to maintain the intervals at which import licence applications are to be submitted as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (3), and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.
(4) To facilitate management and ensure monitoring and control of the quantities imported, the period of validity of import licences for sugar benefiting from the suspension of the application of import duties should be limited to the end of the 2006/2007 marketing year and the issue of import licences should be restricted to users of industrial sugar. These do not necessarily trade with third countries, and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.
(5) The provisions on the management of the industrial raw material and the obligations on processors laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota (4) should apply to the quantities imported under this Regulation.

Given that the structural measures for the restructuring of the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture, foreseen for 1987 and later, may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for processing and marketing of fish products.\n\n3. Furthermore, investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n\n4. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no financial aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product. With regard to the processing of clams, particular attention will have to be paid to the resources of shellfish, which determine the supplies available to this sector.\n\n5. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in these programmes do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community.'}]}"

Whereas, in Regulation (EEC) No 1391/87, the Council decided, for certain agricultural products originating in the Canary Islands, upon a progressive reduction of the customs duties applicable in the limits of reference quantities with the possibility for the Community to replace in future the facilities by a system of tariff quotas if it should appear that under the preferential system imported quantities exceed, during the course of a determined year, the reference quantities laid down, and if simultaneously these imports cause damage on the Community market; whereas the application of such a system demands that the Community is regularly informed of the development of these imports originating in the Canary Islands; whereas it is therefore indicated to submit the imports of these products to a system of supervision;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on setting off imports of the products in question against the reference quantities at Community level, as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly rapid cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of amounts set off against the reference quantities and keep the Member States informed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1199/88 of 28 April 1988 establishing Community supervision for the imports of certain agricultural products originating in the Canary Islands (1988)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the storage costs for sugar and syrups shall be reimbursed at a flat rate by the Member States;
Whereas Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3042/78 (4), provides that the amount of the levy for Community sugar shall be calculated by dividing the total estimated reimbursement by the estimated quantity of sugar which will be marketed during the sugar marketing year in question; whereas the total estimated reimbursement is to be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amounts carried forward from previous marketing years;
Whereas Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the monthly reimbursement amount shall be fixed by the Council simultaneously with the derived intervention prices; whereas the amount for 1989/90 as laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1255/89 (5), is ECU 0,48 per 100 kilograms of white sugar;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77, the quantity in store to be taken into account for the reimbursement of any one month's storage costs is equal to the arithmetic mean of the quantities held in store in the beginning and at the end of the month in question; whereas, for the 1989/90 marketing year, the quantities of Community sugar in store each month may be estimated by reference to estimated stocks at the beginning of the marketing year, estimated monthly production and the quantities likely to be marketed for domestic consumption or exported during the same month; whereas total average monthly stocks during the 1989/90 marketing year can be estimated at approximately 96 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar; whereas the total reimbursement for Community sugar can thus be estimated at approximately ECU 462 million for the 1989/90 marketing year; whereas the balance of previous sugar marketing years can be estimated at a positive amount of ECU 87 million; whereas the detailed rules for the application of the system of offsetting storage costs for sugar provide that the levy is to be fixed per 100 kilograms of white sugar; whereas the quantity of Community sugar which will be marketed during the 1989/90 marketing year for home consumption or for export may be estimated at approximately 12,5 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar; whereas the amount of the levy for Community sugar should therefore be ECU 3 per 100 kilograms of white sugar:

Whereas significant numbers of export licences for common wheat flour have been issued since 1 February 1998 with advance fixing of the refunds; whereas most of these licences are due to expire on 30 June 1998; whereas failure to export by that date would lead to the forfeit of the security; whereas recourse to pre-financing on 30 June 1998 is the only way of avoiding forfeit of the security; whereas such recourse to pre-financing is one of the rights associated with the export licences;
Whereas the greater overall volume than in previous years of stocks of various cereals already placed in intervention or anticipated carry-over stocks on the open market on 30 June 1998 creates a shortfall in storage capacity in certain regions; whereas the pre-financing system will be difficult or impossible to apply in practice as a result;
Whereas the situation as described above means that recourse cannot be had to the pre-financing system; whereas additional quantities of wheat may be offered for intervention as a result and will be added to the existing significant quantities already offered for intervention at the end of this marketing year;
Whereas arrangements should therefore be made to ensure that the operators can fully use their licences;
Whereas the planned measure must be non-discriminatory through being applied in the same way in all Member States by the operators who choose not to use pre-financing on 30 June 1998; whereas extending the validity of the export licences for common wheat flour is one measure that will meet this objective; whereas, under the circumstances and as an exceptional measure, the validity of these licences should be extended for one and half months at the request of the interested party;
Whereas, in order to ensure that this measure is fully effective, the refund fixed in advance must not be adjusted by the break in the marketing year; whereas provision should therefore be made to waive Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/98 (4), as regards the break in the marketing year;
Whereas in order to avoid any undue advantage or penalty, the interested party applying for an extension should confirm the value of the refund at 30 June 1998 for the quantity in question, which value will remain unchanged until 15 August 1998; whereas any negative correcting factors applying in July and August 1998 to refunds fixed in advance on or after 1 February 1998 should therefore be cancelled; whereas there are no grounds under the circumstances for granting the monthly increase for the month of August; whereas the interested party must therefore agree to forego this increase;

(1) On 7 August 2014 the Russian government introduced a ban on imports of certain products from the Union to Russia, including milk and milk products.

(2) Article 12(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 provides that public intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder shall be available from 1 March to 30 September.
(3) A situation has therefore arisen in which the normal measures available under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 appear to be insufficient to address the market disturbance.
(4) The public intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder has been extended to 31 December 2014 by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 949/2014 (2).
(5) Prices of butter and skimmed milk powder in the Union have further deteriorated and downward pressure is likely to carry on.
(6) In order to cater for a situation where prices would further deteriorate and market disturbances would deepen, it is essential that public intervention is also available after 31 December 2014.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to fix the start of the intervention buying-in period for butter and skimmed milk powder in 2015 at 1 January.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on the minimum level of training of seafarers (1), and in particular Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Directive 2008/106/EC Member States may decide to endorse seafarers' appropriate certificates issued by third countries, provided that the third country concerned is recognised by the Commission. Those third countries have to meet all the requirements of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 (STCW Convention), as amended.
(2) By letter of 13 May 2005, the Republic of Cyprus requested the recognition of Japan. Following this request, the Commission contacted the Japanese authorities with a view to carrying out an assessment of their training and certification system in order to verify whether Japan meets all the requirements of the STCW Convention and whether the appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates. It was explained that the assessment would be based on the results of a fact finding inspection to be carried out by the experts of the European Maritime Safety Agency. After lengthy discussions on the legal framework of the European Union, the Japanese authorities accepted an inspection mission by letter of 8 March 2011. The Commission then proceeded with the assessment of the training and certification system in Japan which was based on the results of an inspection carried out by experts of the European Maritime Safety Agency in February 2012 and on the response of 10 January 2014 of the Japanese authorities to a request of 25 October 2012 for a voluntary corrective action plan.
(3) The assessment did not reveal serious concerns though it identified some areas in need of attention. In particular, the quality standards system of the maritime administration and of the Maritime Education and Training Institutions did not cover some processes. Also, the syllabi and the practical training established by the national standards did not ensure the achievement of some prescribed standards of competence for the ‘Life Saving’ and ‘Fire Fighting’ courses.
(4) The Japanese legislation allowed candidates for certification to complete the seagoing service on board ships below the tonnage or propulsion power limits corresponding to the certificate to be issued or on board fishing vessels or Coast Guard ships. In order to ensure that this type of seagoing service was relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences were achieved during the seagoing service, the administration applied certain criteria for the candidates that had completed 12 months of seagoing service as part of an approved training programme. However, based on the analysis of the documentation provided by the Japanese authorities, it appeared that the administration did not ensure that this type of seagoing service was relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences were achieved during this seagoing service for the candidates who had completed 36 months of seagoing service. Also, it appeared that the administration did not ensure that this type of seagoing service was relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences were achieved during this seagoing service for the revalidation and upgrade of certificates for all candidates.
(5) Lastly, the administration required candidates who have approved seagoing service of 12 months as part of an approved training programme to complete approved education in order to apply for certification at operational level. However, it appeared that the administration did not require candidates who have completed 36 months of seagoing service to also complete approved education in order to apply for certification at operational level.
(6) By letter of 5 June 2014, the Commission invited the Japanese authorities to provide the necessary clarifications for the issues raised in the assessment supported by relevant documentation. On 4 August 2014 the Japanese authorities submitted their response.
(7) In their response, the Japanese authorities provided documentation to demonstrate that all missing processes are now covered by a quality standards system. Also, they have drafted new legislation and they have upgraded their facilities to cover the missing standards in the ‘Life Saving’ and ‘Fire Fighting’ courses.
(8) Regarding the verification by the administration that the seagoing service is relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences are achieved during the seagoing service for the candidates who had completed 36 months of seagoing service and those who applied for revalidation and upgrade of their certificates, the Japanese authorities argued that they apply criteria for certification, upgrading and revalidation relating to the ship's size, navigational area and capacity performed. However, the application of such criteria was not sufficiently demonstrated by the information provided.
(9) Regarding the completion of approved education by candidates applying for certification at operational level who have completed 36 months of seagoing service, the Japanese authorities argued that they comply with the relevant requirements of the STCW Convention. However, such compliance was not sufficiently demonstrated by the information provided.
(10) Though the justifications as regards the last two points do not alleviate completely the concerns raised in the assessment, the overall level of compliance of Japan with STCW requirements on training and certification of seafarers is not called into question.
(11) The final outcome of the assessment demonstrates that Japan complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention, while this country has taken appropriate measures to prevent fraud involving certificates.
(12) Member States were provided with a report on the results of the assessment.
(13) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,","{'header': '19.12.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 365/158', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 December 2014\non the recognition of Japan pursuant to Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the systems for training and certification of seafarers\n(notified under document C(2014) 9590)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/935/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Directive 2008/106/EC Member States may decide to endorse seafarers' appropriate certificates issued by third countries, provided that the third country concerned is recognised by the Commission.

However, based on the analysis of the documentation provided by the Japanese authorities, it appeared that the administration did not ensure that this type of seagoing service was relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences were achieved during this seagoing service for the candidates who had completed 36\xa0months of seagoing service. Also, it appeared that the administration did not ensure that this type of seagoing service was relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences were achieved during this seagoing service for the revalidation and upgrade of certificates for all candidates.\n\n((5)) Lastly, the administration required candidates who have approved seagoing service of 12\xa0months as part of an approved training programme to complete approved education in order to apply for certification at operational level. However, it appeared that the administration did not require candidates who have completed 36 months of seagoing service to also complete approved education in order to apply for certification at operational level.\n\n((6)) By letter of 5 June 2014, the Commission invited the Japanese authorities to provide the necessary clarifications for the issues raised in the assessment supported by relevant documentation. On 4 August 2014 the Japanese authorities submitted their response.\n\n((7)) In their response, the Japanese authorities provided documentation to demonstrate that all missing processes are now covered by a quality standards system. Also, they have drafted new legislation and they have upgraded their facilities to cover the missing standards in the ‘Life Saving’ and ‘Fire Fighting’ courses.\n\n((8)) Regarding the verification by the administration that the seagoing service is relevant to the certificate applied for and that all relevant competences are achieved during the seagoing service for the candidates who had completed 36\xa0months of seagoing service and those who applied for revalidation and upgrade of their certificates, the Japanese authorities argued that they apply criteria for certification, upgrading and revalidation relating to the ship's size, navigational area and capacity performed. However, the application of such criteria was not sufficiently demonstrated by the information provided.\n\n((9)) Regarding the completion of approved education by candidates applying for certification at operational level who have completed 36\xa0months of seagoing service, the Japanese authorities argued that they comply with the relevant requirements of the STCW Convention. However, such compliance was not sufficiently demonstrated by the information provided.\n\n((10)) Though the justifications as regards the last two points do not alleviate completely the concerns raised in the assessment, the overall level of compliance of Japan with STCW requirements on training and certification of seafarers is not called into question.\n\n((11)) The final outcome of the assessment demonstrates that Japan complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention, while this country has taken appropriate measures to prevent fraud involving certificates.\n\n((12)) Member States were provided with a report on the results of the assessment.\n\n((13)) The measure provided for in this Decision is in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFor the purposes of Article 19 of Directive 2008/106/EC, Japan is recognised as regards the systems for the training and certification of seafarers.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

(1) By fax of 29 December 1999, registered by the Commission on 10 January 2000 as aid NN 2/2000, the German Government informed the Commission of financial measures to assist Ingenieur- und Gewerbebau GmbH (hereinafter IGB). Given that the financial measures had already been granted to the company, they were registered as unnotified State aid (NN) in accordance with Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty.
(2) By letter dated 29 September 2001, the Commission informed Germany that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid.
(3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(2). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid. The case was then registered as C 66/2001. No comments were received from third parties. Comments were received from Germany on 11 November 2001.
II. DESCRIPTION
(4) The case concerns financial measures to assist the restructuring of an SME active in the building sector in Thuringia. On 1 January 1997 IGB was merged with HAB, a company owned by IGB's shareholders, and subsequently traded under the name of HAB. Some basic economic data are given below:

2. State financial measures to assist the restructuring
(7) According to the information in the Commission's possession, the following measures were granted from public sources to assist the restructuring of:
(a) a DEM 580000 grant from the BvS (successor to the Treuhand privatisation agency);
(b) a 80 % deficiency guarantee from the Land of Thuringia amounting to DEM 1200000 and covered by an approved aid scheme(3);
(c) a one-off investment allowance of DEM 1700 granted under an approved investment allowance scheme(4).
(8) According to the information provided, a loan of DEM 500000 at 5,5 % from the European Recovery Programme (ERP) and a loan of DEM 250000 at 5,5 % from the Thuringia Development Bank (TAB) were granted. No further information on these measures could be obtained.
3. Financial contributions from other sources
(9) Germany indicated the following contributions as contributions from the beneficiary or from external commercial sources:
(a) investor's own capital: DEM 170000;
(b) a 20 % personal guarantee from the investor amounting to DEM 300000;
(c) joint liability of the investors for 80 % of the loans, i.e. some DEM 920000;
(d) decision by the workforce to forgo the Christmas allowance, representing DEM 345000.
(10) Germany is of the opinion that these contributions have to be regarded as contributions from the beneficiary from its own or external commercial sources to the restructuring totalling DEM 1735000, i.e. 66 % of the restructuring costs.
4. Reasons for initiating the procedure under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty
(11) The Commission expressed the following doubts as to the compatibility of the aid with the common market:
(a) the ERP loan of DEM 500000 and the TAB loan of DEM 250000 possibly contained aid elements; an information injunction was thus issued;
(b) the restructuring plan was possibly not suited to restoring the long-term viability of IGB/HAB since the market conditions in the sector were very difficult and the company was a small company with limited resources;
(c) the aid to IGB possibly distorted competition unduly since IGB operated in a sector characterised by overcapacity and the restructuring should have involved some reduction of capacity; despite a request for information, Germany did not provide any details of the capacity situation at IGB/HAB. Accordingly, the Commission issued a further information injunction;
(d) the aid was possibly not in proportion to the restructuring costs and benefits since, contrary to the opinion of the German authorities, the beneficiary's contribution appeared to be DEM 240000, i.e. 9,2 % of the restructuring costs.
III. COMMENTS FROM GERMANY
(12) In its reply to the decision to initiate the procedure, Germany informed the Commission that the local court in Gera refused to set the bankruptcy proceedings in motion because the remaining assets were insufficient to cover the administrative costs. The company was ipso jure dissolved. According to Germany, a continuation of the business in any form whatsoever is thus ruled out in practice.
(13) No further comments concerning the points raised in the decision to initiate the procedure were made since Germany is of the opinion that, in view of developments, this would serve no purpose.
IV. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID
(14) Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty applies to all the financial measures granted by Germany to the recipient undertaking since they confer economic benefits on a specific undertaking which it would not have received from commercial sources. The measures therefore constitute State aid likely to distort competition. Given the nature of the support provided and the existence of inter-State trade within the common market in the sector in which the recipient undertaking was active, the financial measures granted fall within the scope of Article 87(1).
(15) With respect to the aid allegedly granted under approved schemes, the Commission notes that, according to the information available to it, these measures comply with the conditions of those schemes and need not be further assessed in this decision.
(16) In addition to the BvS grant of DEM 580000, the ERP loan of DEM 500000 and the TAB loan of DEM 250000 have also to be considered as ad hoc aid for the restructuring since no other information is available.
(17) The Commission further notes that Germany failed to comply with its obligation under Article 88(3) of the EC Treaty. From a formal viewpoint, the aid is therefore unlawful. This does not necessarily mean, however, that it is incompatible with the common market. As a consequence, the individual measures must be examined under Article 87 of the EC Treaty.
(18) Since the other derogations provided for in Article 87(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty do not apply, the measures are assessed under Article 87(3)(c) and under the 1994 guidelines on rescue and restructuring aid(5) (the guidelines). The guidelines are applicable in the present case since all the aid measures were granted before the 1999 guidelines(6) took effect.
(19) Since no comments on the substance of the case were received in the course of the formal investigation procedure, the doubts raised in the decision to open the procedure have not been allayed. Accordingly, on the basis of the available information, the Commission must conclude that:
(a) the restructuring plan was not suited to restoring the long-term viability of HAB;
(b) the aid for IGB unduly distorted competition;
(c) the aid was not in proportion to the restructuring costs and benefits.
(20) Consequently, the aid for IGB does not comply with the criteria laid down in the guidelines and has to be considered incompatible with the common market.
(21) Where an unlawfully granted aid measure has been found to be incompatible with the common market, the Commission is required under Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 of the EC Treaty(7) to order recovery of the aid unless this would be contrary to a general principle of Community law. According to the information provided by Germany, the beneficiary company has been dissolved by order of the local court in Gera on account of a lack of assets and any continuation of its activities in any form whatsoever is ruled out. The Commission has therefore decided that an order for recovery of the aid in the present case would serve no purpose.
V. CONCLUSION
(22) The Commission finds that Germany has unlawfully implemented financial measures for Ingenieur- und Gewerbebau GmbH (IGB) in breach of Article 88(3) of the Treaty. On the basis of its assessment, it concludes that the aid is incompatible with the common market as it does not fulfil the conditions set out in the guidelines. However, in view of the facts of the case, recovery of the aid should not be required under the second sentence of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 659/1999,","{'title': '2002/897/EC: Commission Decision of 12 March 2002 on the State aid implemented by Germany for Ingenieur- und Gewerbebau GmbH (IGB) (notified under document number C(2002) 912) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe State aid which Germany has implemented for Ingenieur- und Gewerbebau GmbH (IGB), amounting to EUR 680018 (DEM 1330000), is incompatible with the common market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Brussels, 12 March 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario Monti\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ C 330, 24.11.2001, p. 5.\n\n(2) See footnote 1.\n\n(3) Bürgschaftsrichtlinie der Thüringer Aufbaubank, SG(96)D/11696 of 27 December 1996 (N 117/96).\n\n(4) Investitionszulage für die neuen Länder, SG(95)D/17154 of 27 December 1995, as amended by SG(96)D/3794 of 12 April 1996 (N 494/A/95).\n\n(5) OJ C 368, 23.12.1994, p. 12.\n\n(6) OJ C 288, 9.10.1999, p. 2.\n\n(7) OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1.'}]}"

(1) Under Council Directive 79/117/EEC(4), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2003/807(5), mercuric oxide, mercurous chloride (calomel), other inorganic mercury compounds, alkyl mercury compounds, alcoxyalkyl and aryl mercury compounds, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, HCH, hexachlorobenzene, camphechlor (toxaphene), ethylene oxide, nitrofen, 1,2-dibromoethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, dinoseb and binapacryl are pesticides, prohibited for use and placing on the market in the EC. In view of the availability of some of these pesticides on the world market it is prudent to set Maximum Residue Levels for all products at the Lower Limit of Analytical Determination. Some mercuric compounds cannot be distinguished from mercuric compounds originating from environmental contamination.
(2) Where no legal use of a pesticide is allowed and where no residues can be tolerated it is appropriate that the MRL established at the appropriate lower limit of analytical determination on fresh produce, apply also on the composite and processed products.
(3) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants have been taken into account, in particular its advice and recommendations concerning the methodology to be followed for the protection of consumers of agricultural products treated with pesticides.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1372/95(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1383/2001(4), lays down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the poultrymeat sector.

(3) The new, more flexible rules apply to licences applied for from 10 July 2001. However, the problems in trade with Russia following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in several Member States have made the use of certain licences applied for before 10 July 2001 impossible.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 508/71 (3) provides that private storage aid may be granted for certain long-keeping cheeses where there is a serious imbalance of the market which may be eliminated or reduced by seasonal storage;
Whereas the seasonal nature of Emmental and Gruyère cheese production is aggravated by the fact that the seasonal trend in consumption of such cheeses is the opposite of their production; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for recourse to such storage in respect of a quantity corresponding to the difference between summer and winter production;

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 302/2011
of 28 March 2011
opening an exceptional import tariff quota for certain quantities of sugar in the 2010/11 marketing year
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organization of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 187, in conjunction with Article 4, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The world market prices for sugar have been at a constant high level since the beginning of the 2010/11 marketing year. Forecasts of world market prices based on the New York sugar futures exchange market for the terms of May, July and October 2011 indicate that world market price will remain high.
(2) The negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar on the Union market over the last 2 marketing years is estimated at 1,0 million tonnes. This results in the lowest level of ending stocks since the implementation of the 2006 reform of the sugar sector. Any further shortfall of imports threatens to disrupt the availability of supply on the Union sugar market and to increase the internal sugar market price. To limit the negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar on the Union market in the 2010/11 marketing year, it is necessary to fully utilise all existing import flows: the import tariff rate quotas and the 1,95 million tonnes of imports resulting from Economic Partnership Agreements/Everything But Arms (EPA/EBA) trade arrangements.
(3) However, EPA/EBA imports registered during the 2009/10 marketing year were 1,5 million tonnes. Based on the current world market situation, this quantity is unlikely to increase in the short term. This would inevitably lead to a further shortfall in the supply on the EU market. This situation is caused by high prices on the world market for sugar and for that reason, it is necessary to suspend import duty for certain quantities of sugar.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 of 25 September 2009 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas in the sugar sector (2) provides for the administration of the tariff quotas for imports of sugar products pursuant to Article 187 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 with order number 09.4380 (exceptional import sugar). However, in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 the quantities of those products for which import duties are to be suspended has to be determined by a separate legal act.
(5) The exceptional quantity of sugar that can be imported at zero duty in the 2011/12 marketing year need to be set accordingly.
(6) To avoid import licence trading, the rights deriving from the import licence should not be transferable.
(7) The level of the security should be set at a sufficiently high level to ensure full utilisation of the issued import licences under the current, volatile world sugar prices.
(8) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,","{'header': '29.3.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 81/8', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 302/2011\nof 28 March 2011\nopening an exceptional import tariff quota for certain quantities of sugar in the 2010/11 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The world market prices for sugar have been at a constant high level since the beginning of the 2010/11 marketing year.

Any further shortfall of imports threatens to disrupt the availability of supply on the Union sugar market and to increase the internal sugar market price. To limit the negative difference between availability and utilisation of sugar on the Union market in the 2010/11 marketing year, it is necessary to fully utilise all existing import flows: the import tariff rate quotas and the 1,95\xa0million tonnes of imports resulting from Economic Partnership Agreements/Everything But Arms (EPA/EBA) trade arrangements.\n\n((3)) However, EPA/EBA imports registered during the 2009/10 marketing year were 1,5\xa0million tonnes. Based on the current world market situation, this quantity is unlikely to increase in the short term. This would inevitably lead to a further shortfall in the supply on the EU market. This situation is caused by high prices on the world market for sugar and for that reason, it is necessary to suspend import duty for certain quantities of sugar.\n\n((4)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 of 25 September 2009 opening and providing for the administration of certain Community tariff quotas in the sugar sector(2)provides for the administration of the tariff quotas for imports of sugar products pursuant to Article 187 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 with order number 09.4380 (exceptional import sugar). However, in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 the quantities of those products for which import duties are to be suspended has to be determined by a separate legal act.\n\n((5)) The exceptional quantity of sugar that can be imported at zero duty in the 2011/12 marketing year need to be set accordingly.\n\n((6)) To avoid import licence trading, the rights deriving from the import licence should not be transferable.\n\n((7)) The level of the security should be set at a sufficiently high level to ensure full utilisation of the issued import licences under the current, volatile world sugar prices.\n\n((8)) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe import duties for sugar falling within CN 1701 and with order number 09.4380 shall be suspended for a quantity of 300\xa0000 tonnes from 1 April to 30 September 2011.\nRegulation (EC) No 891/2009 shall apply for the administration of the quota referred to in the first paragraph.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nBy way of derogation from Article 8(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008\n(\n3\n)\n, the rights deriving from the import licence shall not be transferable.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nBy way of derogation from Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 891/2009, the amount of the security shall be EUR 150 per tonne.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in\nthe Official Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2011.\nIt shall expire on 30 September 2011.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 69/494/EEC of 16 December 1969 on the progressive standardization of agreements concerning commercial relations between Member States and third countries and on the negotiation of Community agreements (1), and in  particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas extension or tacit renewal beyond the end of the transitional period was last authorized in the case of the Agreements and Protocols listed in the Annex by Decision 91/181/EEC (2);
Whereas the Member States concerned have, with a view to avoiding any disruption of their commercial relations with third countries concerned based on Agreements, requested authorization to extend or renew the abovementioned Agreements;
Whereas, however, most of the areas covered by these national Agreements are henceforth the subject of Community Agreements; whereas, in this situation, there should be authorization for the maintenance of national Agreements only for those areas not  covered by Community Agreements; whereas, in addition, such authorization should not, therefore, adversely affect the obligation incumbent upon the Member States to avoid and, where appropriate, to eliminate any incompatibility between such Agreements  and the provisions of Community law;
Whereas the provisions of the Agreements to be either prolonged or renewed should not furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas the Member States concerned have declared that the extension or tacit renewal of these Agreements would neither constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community negotiations with the third countries concerned and the transfer of the commercial  substance of those Agreements to Community Agreements nor, during the period under consideration, hinder the adoption of the measures necessary to complete the standardization of the import arrangements of the Member States;
Whereas at the conclusion of the consultations provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC it was established, as the aforesaid declarations by the Member States concerned confirm, that the provisions of the Agreements to be extended or renewed  would not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas, in these circumstances, the Agreements concerned may be either extended or tacitly renewed for a limited period,","{'title': '92/239/EEC: Council Decision of 28 April 1992 authorizing extension or tacit renewal of certain trade agreements concluded between Member States and third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe trade Agreements and Protocols between Member States and third countries, as listed in the Annex hereto, may be extended or tacitly renewed up to the dates indicated for each of them for those areas not covered by Agreements between the  Community and the third countries concerned and in so far as their provisions are not contrary to existing common policies.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2047/2001(4), and in particular Article 92 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 lays down, inter alia, the detailed rules for disposing of stocks of alcohol obtained from distillation under Articles 27, 28 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and held by the intervention agencies.
(2) Public sales of wine alcohol for use in the fuel sector in the Community should be organised with a view to reducing Community stocks of wine alcohol and to some extent ensuring supplies to firms approved under Article 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000. Community stocks of wine alcohol held by the Member States come from distillation under Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organisation of the market in wine(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/1999(6), and under Articles 27, 28 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
(3) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(7), the selling price and securities must be expressed, and payments made, in euro.
(4) Given that there are risks of fraud by substitution of alcohol, it would appear necessary to reinforce checks on the final destination of the alcohol, allowing the intervention agencies to call on the help of international control agencies and to check the alcohol sold by means of nuclear magnetic resonance analyses.
