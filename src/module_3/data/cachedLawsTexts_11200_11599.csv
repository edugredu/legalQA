Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed (1) as last amended by Directive 96/72/EC (2), and in particular Article 17 thereof,
Having regard to the requests submitted by Denmark, Austria and Sweden,
Whereas in Denmark, Austria and Sweden the production of seed of the category 'certified seed` of certain varieties of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) satisfying the requirements of the said Directive in relation to minimum germination capacity has been insufficient in 1997 and is therefore not adequate to meet these countries' needs; whereas those varieties are, in the case of Denmark, varieties of the semi leaflet type with round green or yellow seeds proven to be suitable under the conditions of the applicant country or similar growing conditions; whereas those varieties in the case of Austria are varieties tested and adapted to the more continental climatic conditions in the east of the applicant country and are characterised by a yellow colour; whereas those varieties in the case of Sweden are varieties with yellow seeds used as fodder or for cooking which have been shown to be suitable for the growing conditions of the applicant country;
Whereas it is not possible to cover this demand satisfactorily with seed from other Member States, or from third countries, satisfying all the requirements laid down in the said Directive;
Whereas Denmark, Austria and Sweden should therefore be authorised to permit for a period expiring on 30 June 1998 the marketing of seed of the abovementioned species subject to less stringent requirements;
Whereas, moreover, other Member States which are able to supply Denmark, Austria or Sweden with such seed not satisfying the requirements of the said Directive should be authorised to permit the marketing of such seed;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,","{'title': '98/254/EC: Commission Decision of 25 March 1998 authorising the Member States to permit temporarily the marketing of seed of field pea (Pisum sativum L.) not satisfying the requirements of Council Directive 66/401/EEC (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators (1), and in particular Article 6(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Decision 2001/539/EC (2) the Community concluded the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, agreed at Montreal on 28 May 1999 (Montreal Convention), which lays down rules on liability in respect of the international carriage by air of persons, baggage and cargo.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 established minimum insurance requirements in respect of liability for passengers, baggage and cargo at a level to ensure that air carriers are adequately insured to cover their liability under the Montreal Convention.
(3) The limits of liability of air carriers under the Montreal Convention have recently been reviewed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) by reference to an inflation factor which corresponds to the accumulated rate of inflation since the date of entry into force of the Montreal Convention.
(4) It has been determined by ICAO that the inflation factor since 4 November 2003, the date of entry into force of the Montreal Convention, has exceeded 10 per cent, the threshold for triggering an adjustment of the limits of liability. Therefore, the limits of liability have been revised accordingly.
(5) The minimum insurance requirements in respect of liability for passengers, baggage and cargo, established by Regulation (EC) No 785/2004, should be timely adjusted to the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention which have become effective on 30 December 2009.
(6) For liability in respect of passengers the minimum insurance requirements of Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 have been set at a level significantly exceeding the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention.
(7) In respect of liability for baggage and cargo the minimum insurance requirements of Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 should be increased to the level of the revised limits of liability under the Montreal Convention.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Under the intervention arrangements prior to 1 November 1998 olive oil was purchased by the Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies. The legal basis for those arrangements was repealed with effect from 1 November 1998 by Regulation (EC) No 1638/98. However, in order to guarantee a smooth transition from the intervention buying-in arrangements to the current situation where those arrangements no longer exist and in order to release all available stocks of olive oil from Community intervention agencies, the sale of quantities still in storage in Italy should be authorised. The oil is vat-bottom residues which contain a considerable percentage of olive oil.
(2) Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 of 23 November 1978 on intervention in the olive oil sector(3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2203/90(4), provides that Community olive oil held by intervention agencies should be put up for sale by tender, unless special conditions warrant recourse to other procedures. The olive oil residues still in storage in Italy could not be sold under Commission Regulation (EC) No 2599/2001 of 28 December 2001 on the sale of Community olive oil residues held by the Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies(5) because not enough tenders were received in Italy. Those olive oil residues should be put up for sale again.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(4) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The refunds referred to above must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Application of these quotas results in fixing refunds for the products in question at the levels given in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas the wines in question shall benefit from this tariff quota on condition that Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2342/84 (4), is complied with;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for this quota to all imports of the products concerned into the Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas a system of using a Community tariff quota, based on allocation among the Member States, appears likely to comply with the Community nature of the said quota having regard to the above principles; whereas, in order to reflect most accurately the actual development of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, assessed by reference both to the statistics relating to imports of the said products from Tunisia over a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each of the types of wines in question are available and no reliable estimates of future imports can be made; whereas in these circumstances the quota volumes should be allocated in initial shares, taking into account demand for these wines on the markets of the various Member States;
Whereas, to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve intended to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States who have used up their initial share; whereas, in order to guarantee some degree of security to importers in each Member State, the first instalment of the Community quota should be fixed at a level which could, in the present circumstances, be 50 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may not be used up at the same rate; whereas, in order to take this into account and avoid disruption, any Member State which has used up almost all its initial share should draw a supplementary share from the reserve; whereas this should be done by each Member State each time one of its supplementary shares is almost used up, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and supplementary shares should be valid until the end of the quota
period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be in a position to follow the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a Member State has a considerable quantity of the initial share left over, it is essential that it should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, to prevent a part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2730/85 of 27 September 1985 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the common customs tariff and originating in Tunisia (1985/86 )', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

COUNCIL DECISION 2013/391/CFSP
of 22 July 2013
in support of the practical implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 26(2) and 31(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Whereas:
(1) On 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Chapter III of which contains a list of measures to combat such proliferation which need to be taken both within the Union and in third countries.
(2) The Union is actively implementing this strategy and is giving effect to the measures listed in Chapter III thereof, in particular by releasing financial resources to support specific projects conducted by multilateral institutions, providing States in need with technical assistance and expertise with regard to a wide range of non-proliferation measures, and fostering the role of the United Nations Security Council.
(3) On 28 April 2004, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 (2004) (‘UNSCR 1540 (2004)’), which was the first international instrument to deal in an integrated and comprehensive manner with weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and related materials. UNSCR 1540 (2004) established binding obligations for all States which aimed to prevent and deter non-State actors from obtaining access to such weapons and weapon-related material. It also called upon States to present the Committee of the Security Council established by UNSCR 1540 (2004) (‘the 1540 Committee’) with a report on steps which they have taken or intend to take to implement UNSCR 1540 (2004).
(4) On 27 April 2006, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1673 (2006) and decided that the 1540 Committee should intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through programmes of work, outreach, assistance, dialogue and cooperation. It also invited the 1540 Committee to explore with States and international, regional and sub-regional organisations the possibility of sharing experience and lessons learned, and the availability of programmes which might facilitate the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).
(5) On 20 April 2011, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1977 (2011) and decided to extend the mandate of the 1540 Committee for a period of 10 years until 25 April 2021. It also decided that the 1540 Committee was to continue to intensify its efforts to promote the full implementation by all States of UNSCR 1540 (2004), in particular on areas such as: (a) accountability, (b) physical protection, (c) border controls and law enforcement efforts and (d) national export and trans-shipment controls including controls on providing funds and services such as financing to such exports and trans-shipments.
(6) The implementation of Council Joint Action 2006/419/CFSP of 12 June 2006 in support of the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) and in the framework of the implementation of the EU Strategy against Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (1) and Council Joint Action 2008/368/CFSP of 14 May 2008 in support of the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) and in the framework of the implementation of the EU strategy against proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (2) contributed to diminishing significantly the number of non-reporting States and the number of States which did not submit additional information required by the 1540 Committee following their submission of incomplete reports.
(7) The Office for Disarmament Affairs within the United Nations Secretariat, which is responsible for providing the 1540 Committee and its experts with substantive and logistical support, should be entrusted with the technical implementation of the projects to be carried out under this Decision.
(8) This Decision should be implemented in accordance with the Financial and Administrative Framework Agreement concluded by the European Commission with the United Nations concerning the management of financial contributions by the Union to programmes or projects administered by the United Nations,","{'header': '23.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 198/40', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION 2013/391/CFSP\nof 22 July 2013\nin support of the practical implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 (2004) on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 12 December 2003, the European Council adopted the EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Chapter III of which contains a list of measures to combat such proliferation which need to be taken both within the Union and in third countries.\n\n((2)) The Union is actively implementing this strategy and is giving effect to the measures listed in Chapter III thereof, in particular by releasing financial resources to support specific projects conducted by multilateral institutions, providing States in need with technical assistance and expertise with regard to a wide range of non-proliferation measures, and fostering the role of the United Nations Security Council.\n\n((3)) On 28 April 2004, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1540 (2004) (‘UNSCR 1540 (2004)’), which was the first international instrument to deal in an integrated and comprehensive manner with weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery and related materials.

It is envisaged to support five country visits (each lasting 4 days). Depending on a specific country and decisions of the 1540 Committee, a country visit or country-specific activities will contribute to the national implementation process through: (a) contributions to awareness-raising by means of tailored dialogues with different actors involved in the national implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004); (b) examination of national measures and mechanisms used to implement that resolution and identification of specific challenges faced by the national authorities as well as possible options to remedy them; and (c) facilitation of the preparation of voluntary national action plans and other measures decided by the visited country.\nOrganisation by UNODA, in cooperation, as appropriate, with other international, regional and sub-regional organisations and entities, meetings in specific sub-regions based upon the outcome of the previous capacity-building workshops in the specific sub-regions. It is envisaged to conduct three follow-up meetings in the selected sub-regions (Africa, the Gulf and the Middle East, South East Europe and Latin America). Each meeting will be tailored to meet the actual requirements of the sub-region focusing on areas that are likely to achieve practical results. Meetings will be conducted in conjunction with in-country technical discussions to explore specific measures to sustain progress in the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004). The in-country discussions will be organised in response to invitations by interested Member States.\nThe UN ODA will develop UNSCR 1540 (2004) activities in cooperation with other international organisations and agencies, including the OSCE, IAEA, OPCW, WHO, FAO and OIE, to ensure effective synergies and avoid duplication.\nAs appropriate, synergies will be sought with the activities of the regional Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) ‘Centres of Excellence’, which are currently being set up under the Instrument for Stability as well as with other EU-sponsored programmes in this field.\n2.1.3.\nResults of the measure\nImproved implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) through additional steps to be undertaken by States towards its full implementation; development of effective and realistic national action plans or road maps for the implementation of the key requirements of that resolution; enhanced regional coordinated approaches to the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004); and the establishment of effective partnerships between participating States and assistance providers.\n2.2.\nIncreased capacity-building to establish and maintain physical protection and accounting of sensitive dual-use materials\n2.2.1.\nObjective of the measure\nTo promote capacity-building on national and regional levels to advance full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004) by focusing on one of the resolution’s key areas, namely, the physical protection and accounting of ‘related materials’. UNSCR 1540 (2004) contains specific provisions (operational paragraph 3, subparagraphs a) and b)) obliging all States to establish appropriate controls over materials, equipment and technology which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery. To this end, States are required to: (a) develop and maintain appropriate effective measures to account for and secure such items in production, use, storage or transport; and (b) develop and maintain appropriate effective physical protection measures.\n2.2.2.\nDescription of the measure\nOrganisation by UNODA of two sub-regional workshops (Central America, South East Asia and Latin America) focusing on the physical protection and accounting of ‘related materials’. Through experience-sharing on national policies and practice related to accounting, security and protection of relevant biological, chemical and nuclear materials, the measure will promote integrated national approaches based on good practices and lessons learned.\nThe importance of cooperation and interaction with international organisations such as the IAEA, OPCW, WHO, FAO, OIE and the OSCE will also be emphasized, as appropriate. Each workshop will be organised in conjunction with rounds of relevant technical discussions with participating countries taking into full consideration national specificities. The in-country discussions will be organised in response to invitations by interested Member States in relevant sub-regions.\nAs appropriate, synergies will be sought with the activities of the regional CBRN ‘Centres of Excellence’, which are currently being set up under the Instrument for Stability as well as with other EU-sponsored programmes in this field.\n2.2.3.\nResults of the measure\nImproved national efforts and enhanced capacities to implement appropriate checks over materials, equipment and technology which could be used for the design, development, production or use of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery; identification of effective and efficient practices for accounting, securing and protecting ‘related materials’; increased security of relevant materials at national and regional levels; increased regional and international partnerships in relevant areas; and contribution to efforts to increase global CBRN security.\n2.3.\nSupport for practical implementation of recommendations of the 2009 Comprehensive Review of the status of implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004)\n2.3.1.\nObjective of the measure\nTo support the practical implementation of the 2009 Comprehensive Review recommendations;\nTo enhance international cooperation and raise public awareness of the importance of the implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n2.3.2.\nDescription of the measure\nUNSCR 1977 (2011) and the Final Document of the 2009 Comprehensive Review envisage a number of specific activities in implementation of key requirements of UNSCR 1540 (2004). The measure includes specific projects to support such activities including through sponsoring meetings/events, training and public relations efforts. Subject, as appropriate, to the 1540 Committee’s decisions and recommendations, the projects would include:\n—\norganisation by UNODA of events to bring together those offering and seeking assistance and meetings of current or prospective partners (States, international and regional organisations);\n—\nUNODA-organised meetings to support efforts to enhance the cooperation of the 1540 Committee with international non-proliferation mechanisms and other international and regional organisations;\n—\norganisation or sponsorship by UNODA of a workshop of representatives of civil society, academia and industry;\n—\nsponsorship by UNODA of participation of national officials in training courses and other capacity-building activities;\n—\nsponsorship of an electronic journal on UNSCR 1540 (2004) implementation issues.\nAs appropriate, synergies will be sought with the activities of the regional CBRN ‘Centres of Excellence’, which are currently being set up under the Instrument for Stability as well as with other EU-sponsored programmes in this field.\n2.3.3.\nResults of the measure\nImplementation of specific measures agreed at the 2009 Comprehensive Review; more diverse means for facilitating technical assistance; provision of UNSCR 1540 (2004)-focussed training to national officials; greater involvement of representatives of civil society, academia and industry in international, regional and national UNSCR 1540 (2004) implementation efforts; enhanced public awareness of importance of full implementation of UNSCR 1540 (2004).\n3.\nPARTNERS IN THE MEASURES\n—\nUN Security Council and its 1540 Committee;\n—\nParticipating governments from respective sub-regions;\n—\nGovernments and organisations offering assistance;\n—\nUnited Nations, relevant international, regional and sub-regional organisations;\n—\nNon-governmental organisations and civil society entities.\n4.\nBENEFICIARIES OF THE MEASURES\n—\nMember States, government officials;\n—\n1540 Committee and other UN entities;\n—\nInternational, regional and sub-regional organisations;\n—\nGovernments and organisations providing and receiving technical assistance under UNSCR 1540 (2004);\n—\nCivil society, academia and relevant industries.\n5.\nVENUE\nUNODA will select potential venues for the meetings, workshops and other events. The criteria used for choosing the venues will include the willingness and commitment of a relevant State in a particular region to host the event. Specific locations of country visits or country-specific activities will depend on invitations from interested Member States and, as appropriate, on decisions of the 1540 Committee.\n6.\nDURATION\nThe total estimated duration of the project is 24 months.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2521/2001 of 20 December 2001 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice-products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products appearing in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed either in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to amended Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 respectively, are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 21 December 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nErkki Liikanen\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(4) OJ L 271, 12.10.2001, p. 5.\n\n(5) OJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(6) OJ L 208, 1.8.2001, p. 8.\n\n(7) OJ L 275, 29.9.1987, p. 36.\n\n(8) OJ L 159, 1.7.1993, p. 112.\n\n(9) OJ L 242, 12.9.2001, p. 3.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 20 December 2001 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), and in particular Article 18 (1), (6) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (2), and in particular Article 22(1), (5) and (6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and other birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to sharply reduce the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced into Member States via international trade in live poultry and certain other birds and products thereof.
(2) Israel has notified the Commission of outbreaks in poultry of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by influenza A virus of subtype H5N1.
(3) Commission Decision 2006/227/EC of 17 March 2006 concerning certain interim protection measures in relation to a suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Israel (3) was adopted following that notification by Israel.
(4) In view of the animal health risk of the introduction of the disease into the Community, it is appropriate to suspend imports of live poultry, ratites and farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs of those species from Israel.
(5) As Member States are authorised to import game trophies and eggs for human consumption, imports into the Community of these products should also be suspended because of the animal health risk involved.
(6) It is also appropriate to suspend the importation into the Community from Israel of fresh meat of poultry, ratites and farmed and wild feathered game and the importation of minced meat, mechanically separated meat, meat preparations and meat products consisting of or containing meat of those species, as well as certain other products of birds.
(7) It is appropriate to provide for measures that may be applied regarding parts of Israel depending on the epidemiological situation.
(8) Certain products derived from poultry, ratites and farmed and wild feathered game slaughtered or hunted before 15 February 2006 should continue to be authorised, taking into account the incubation period of the disease.
(9) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC of 3 June 2005 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC (4) lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of certain meat products and establishes treatment regimes considered effective in inactivating the respective pathogens. In order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products, appropriate treatment must be applied depending on the health status of the country of origin and the species the product is obtained from. It appears therefore appropriate, that imports of meat products of poultry, ratites and farmed and wild feathered game originating in Israel and treated to a temperature of at least 70 °C throughout the product should continue to be authorised.
(10) The conditions for the imports of feathers are laid down in Commission Decision 2006/7/EC of 9 January 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to the imports of feathers from certain third countries (5). It is therefore unnecessary to provide for a specific ban on imports of untreated feathers from Israel.
(11) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2006/227/EC and replace it by the present Decision.

It is therefore appropriate to provide the relevant data parameters ensuring that such verification may be effectively performed.
(4) The methodology set out in Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 applies with regard to incomplete and completed vehicles. However, where a complete vehicle is further transformed prior to the first registration, it should be clarified that it is the mass in running order and the CO2 emissions of the complete vehicle that is used as a base vehicle that should be monitored and taken into account for the calculation of the specific emissions targets.
(5) It is necessary to specify further the data that should be provided in order to ensure that the CO2 emission performance of multi-stage vehicles can be adequately and efficiently monitored and verified.
(6) A vehicle is identified by a vehicle identification number (hereinafter referred to as ‘VIN’), i.e. an alphanumeric code assigned to the vehicle by the manufacturer in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 19/2011 (3). Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provides, in Section 4 of Annex XVII, that the identification number of the base vehicle shall, as the basic rule, be retained during all subsequent stages of the type-approval process to ensure the traceability of the process. Through the VIN it should therefore be possible to link the completed vehicle to a base vehicle and thus determine the base vehicle manufacturer responsible for the CO2 emissions. Moreover, the VIN should allow the base vehicle manufacturer to verify the relevant data related to the base vehicle. As there are no other parameters that can provide that kind of link, it is appropriate to require Member States to monitor and report VINs of newly registered N1 vehicles to the Commission through the data collection system of the European Environment Agency (EEA).
(7) In order to calculate the specific emissions targets with regard to multi-stage vehicles, it is necessary, in accordance with point 7 of Part B of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, to consider the default added mass determined in accordance with point 5.3 of Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 692/2008. This will require the monitoring and reporting of the mass in running order of the base vehicle and the technically permissible maximum laden mass of that vehicle, through which the default added mass may be determined, or, alternatively, the monitoring and reporting of the default added mass itself. Moreover, in order to determine whether a multi-stage vehicle falls within the scope of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, it is necessary to verify that the reference mass of the completed vehicle does not exceed the limits referred to in Article 2(1) of that Regulation.
(8) Where Member States are not able to provide all the parameters required pursuant to Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 due to the design of their system for registration of data relating to new light commercial vehicles, those parameters may be provided by the manufacturers concerned in the notification referred to in Article 8(5) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011.
(9) For that same reason, manufacturers may, in accordance with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 293/2012 (5), provide the Commission and the EEA with the VINs they assigned to vehicles sold in the preceding calendar year or for which a warranty was issued in that year.
(10) VINs may, following the registration of a vehicle for its entry into service in road traffic, be linked to datasets permitting the identification of the owner of the vehicle. The VIN by itself is, however, not a carrier of personal data and the processing of data for the purposes of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 does not require access to or the processing of any linked personal data. The monitoring and reporting of VINs is therefore not considered as processing of personal data falling within the scope of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) or Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). Nevertheless, it is recognised that VINs may be considered to be sensitive data, inter alia, with regard to the prevention of vehicle theft, and it is therefore appropriate to ensure that the VINs reported to the Commission and the EEA are not made public.
(11) By matching the VINs reported by the Member States with those provided by the manufacturers, the Commission, supported by the EEA, should identify the manufacturers and the vehicles concerned and prepare the provisional dataset in accordance with Article 10b of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 293/2012.
(12) In order to ensure full parallelism of the monitoring requirements under Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 with those applicable to passenger cars under Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), it is appropriate to adapt the requirements in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 on the provision of aggregated data and the methodology for determining the CO2 monitoring information for light commercial vehicles.
(13) Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '24.4.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 121/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 404/2014\nof 17 February 2014\namending Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the monitoring of CO2emissions from new light commercial vehicles type-approved in a multi-stage process\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex XII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008(2)sets out a new method for determining the CO2emissions from and fuel consumption of N1vehicles which are type-approved in a multi-stage process (hereinafter referred to as ‘multi-stage vehicles’).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1) and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides for a Community financial contribution for the undertaking of technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for veterinary education and training.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, in a report of 27 June 2000, recommended that surveys be carried out on poultry flocks and wild birds for avian influenza, in particular to determine the prevalence of infections with avian influenza virus subtypes H5 and H7.
(3) Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza (2), defines Community control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza in poultry. However, it does not provide for regular surveys of that disease in poultry and wild birds.
(4) Commission Decision 2005/464/EC of 21 June 2005 on the implementation of survey programmes for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds to be carried out in the Member States (3) provides for the implementation in 2005 of surveys for avian influenza in poultry and wild birds in the Member States, subject to the survey plans being approved by the Commission. Such surveys should investigate the presence of infections in poultry, which could lead to a review of current legislation and contribute to the knowledge of the possible threats for animals and humans from wildlife. That Decision provides that, by 30 June 2005, Member States are to submit to the Commission for approval programmes for the implementation of those surveys in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Annex thereto.
(5) Member States submitted those programmes by 30 June 2005. However, following the recent evolution of the avian influenza situation in Asia, and in particular as regards surveillance in migratory birds, an expert group meeting convened on 25 August 2005 and 6 September 2005 concluded that, taking into account the existing knowledge on the migratory routes of the species of birds proceeding from central and western Asia it is appropriate to improve surveillance in wild birds and intensify the surveillance programmes already planned for 2005/2006, by increasing sampling on migratory waterfowl along the flyways that could pose a risk for disease introduction.
(6) In accordance with those conclusions, Member States have modified their programmes and have communicated those amendments to the Commission for approval. In order to allow those amended programmes to be approved and the Community’s financial contribution to be decided in due time, the deadline for the submission of the programmes, the list of tests to be financed and the conditions set out in the Annex to Decision 2005/464/EC should be amended.
(7) Decision 2005/464/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas it is necessary to lay down health requirements for imports of fresh meat from Romania;
Whereas, following a Community veterinary mission, it appears that the animal health situation in Romania compares favourably with that in most of the Community countries, particularly as regards diseases transmissible through meat;
Whereas, in addition, the responsible veterinary authorities of Romania have confirmed that Romania has for at least 12 months been free from rinderpest, exotic and classical foot-and-mouth disease, African swine fever, classical swine fever, contagious porcine paralysis (Teschen disease) and swine vesicular disease and that no vaccinations have been carried out against those diseases during that time, with the exception of classical foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever; whereas animals vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease and classical swine fever are present in Romania;
Whereas the responsible veterinary authorities of Romania have undertaken to notify the Commission of the European Communities and the Member States, by telex or telegram, within 24 hours, of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of the abovementioned diseases or an alteration in vaccination policy against them;
Whereas animal health conditions and veterinary certification must be adapted according to the animal health situation of the non-member country concerned;
Whereas certain Member States, because of their particular animal health situations concerning foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever, benefit from special provisions in intra-Community trade and should therefore also be authorized to apply special provisions in respect of imports from third countries; whereas these provisions must be at least as strict as those which the same Member States apply in intra-Community trade;
Whereas it will be necessary to re-examine this Decision with a view to its adaptation to Community rules concerning the control and eradication of foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever within the Community;

Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the European Economic Community undertook, within the framework of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), to open an annual Community tariff quota of 5 000 head at a duty of 4 % for bulls, cows and heifers, othelr than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine breeds; whereas eligibility for such quota is subject to submission of the following documents:
- bulls: a pedigree certificate,
- female animals: a pedigree certificate or certificate of registration in the herdbook, certifying purity of breed;
Whereas the abovementioned tariff quota should therefore be opened for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 at a duty 4 %; whereas, however, under the terms of Article 282 of the Act of Accession, the Portuguese Republic is authorized to postpone until the beginning of the second stage the progressive application to imports of preferences granted by the Community, unilaterally or by agreement, to certain third countries; whereas a check should be carried out to ascertain that the imported animals have not been slaughtered within a certain period;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and continuous access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and the uninterrupted application of the quota duties, to all imports of the animals in question until the quota is exhausted; whereas the necessary measures should be taken to ensure efficient administration of this tariff quota, taking into account the Community nature of the quota and special factors in the trade in these animals; whereas to this end the Commission should assign to the Member States on request the quantities needed to cover actual imports in accordance with an economically appropriate procedure to be determined;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the quantities levied by that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1788/89 of 19 June 1989 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine breeds', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (1), and in particular Article 46(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 1999/659/EC (2), the Commission determined the initial allocations to the Member States for rural development measures part-financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section for the period 2000 to 2006.
(2) The third paragraph of Article 1 of Decision 1999/659/EC limits the maximum amount eligible under EAGGF for the period 16 October to 31 December 2006. Following the transitional measures included in Article 39(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (3) that provision is no longer applicable.
(3) In accordance with Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, initial allocations shall be adjusted on the basis of actual expenditure and revised expenditure forecasts submitted by the Member States taking into account programmes objectives.
(4) In accordance with Article 57(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (4), the Commission shall adapt the initial allocations per Member State fixed by Decision 1999/659/EC within two months of the adoption of the budget for the financial year concerned.
(5) The adaptation of the initial allocations has to take into account the financial execution realised by Member States in the years 2000-2005 and the revised forecasts for the year 2006, submitted before 1 October 2005. Following the provisions of Article 55(1)(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004, the expenditure forecasts for 2006 indicate that an amount of the budget appropriations for 2006 will be left unspent. In accordance with Article 46(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the Commission shall reallocate the unused funds among the Member States which foresee to fully use their financial envelopes for the programming period 2000-2006, following the distribution key of the initial allocations included in Decision 1999/659/EC.
(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (5) provides that the amounts resulting from the modulation shall be available as additional Community support for measures under rural development programming financed under the EAGGF ‘Guarantee’ Section to Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(7) By Commission Decision C(2005) 5314 of 19 December 2005 (6), amounts resulting from the modulation pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 have been allocated to the Member States. Those allocations need to be added to the allocations to the Member States for the budgetary year 2006 as fixed by Decision 1999/659/EC.
(8) Decision 1999/659/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '19.4.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 106/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 12 April 2006\namending Decision 1999/659/EC fixing an indicative allocation by Member State of the allocations under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund — Guarantee section for rural development measures for the period 2000 to 2006\n(notified under document number C(2006) 1542)\n(Only the Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/289/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 1999/659/EC(2), the Commission determined the initial allocations to the Member States for rural development measures part-financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section for the period 2000 to 2006.\n\n((2)) The third paragraph of Article 1 of Decision 1999/659/EC limits the maximum amount eligible under EAGGF for the period 16 October to 31 December 2006.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 7(1) of Directive 89/686/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) provides that where a Member State ascertains that personal protective equipment bearing the CE marking and used in accordance with its intended purpose could compromise the safety of persons, domestic animals or property, it shall take all necessary measures to remove such personal protective equipment from the market and to prohibit the placing on the market or free movement thereof.
(2) Pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Directive, the Commission is required, after consulting the parties concerned, to declare whether it finds such a measure justified or not. If the measure is found justified, the Commission shall inform the Member States so that they can take all appropriate measures with respect to the equipment concerned, in accordance with their obligations pursuant to Article 2(1).
(3) On 25 August 2008, the UK authorities notified the European Commission a measure prohibiting the placing on the market of the protective clothing for fencers, types Jiang 350N Stretch Jacket and Breeches, manufactured by Wuxi Husheng Sports Goods Plant DongHu Industrial District, Donghutang, WuXi 214196, China and imported by Liam Patterson Associates LLP t/a Jiang-UK, 9 Spencer Road, Buxton, Derbyshire, United Kingdom.
(4) According to the documents submitted to the European Commission, this protective clothing for fencing was subject to a ‘Certificate of Conformity’ dated October 2005, certificate No C0508M29HS11 issued by Ente Certificazione Macchine (Notified Body number 1282).
(5) The UK authorities indicated that their decision was based on the fact that the products concerned failed to comply with the basic health and safety requirements (BHSR) referred to in Article 3 of Directive 89/686/EEC due to the incorrect application of the standards referred to in Article 5 of the Directive. In particular, the UK authorities indicated that the protective clothing for fencers did not have the level of penetration resistance required by standard EN 13567:2002 – Protective clothing – Hand, arm, chest, abdomen, leg, genital and face protectors for fencers – Requirements and test methods. The UK decision was supported by a test report.
(6) On 17 July 2009, the Commission wrote to the importer inviting him to communicate his observations regarding the measure taken by the UK authorities. To date, no reply has been received.
(7) On 17 July 2009, the Commission also wrote to Ente Certificazione Macchine inviting this Body to communicate its observations regarding the measure taken by the UK authorities and, in particular, to clarify whether it had issued the certificate No C0508M29HS11 for the products in question. To date, no reply has been received.
(8) The Commission recalls that protective clothing for fencers must comply with the BHSR set out in Section 3.1.1 of Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC relating to protection against penetrating objects. This requirement is supported by the specifications of clauses 4.6 to 4.8 of the relevant harmonised standard EN 13567 and by the specifications for penetration testing set out in clause 5.10 of the standard.
(9) On 8 April 2010, the Commission contacted the Italian Authorities in order to clarify why Ente Certificazione Macchine had issued the certificate in question and requested the Italian Authorities to take the necessary measures to put an end to misuse of the identification number attributed to Ente Certificazione Macchine by the Commission.
(10) In their reply on 23 June 2010, the Italian Authorities confirmed that Ente Certificazione Macchine had misused its identification number and informed the Commission that the Body had been required to cease issuing such certificates and to inform the authority of any similar certificates issued.
(11) In light of the documentation available and the comments of the parties concerned, the Commission considers that the UK Authorities have demonstrated that the protective clothing for fencers, types Jiang 350N Stretch Jacket and Breeches, fails to comply with the applicable BHSR of Directive 89/686/EEC and that this non-conformity gives rise to a serious risk for users,","{'header': '26.1.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 22/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 25 January 2011\nin application of Article 7 of Council Directive 89/686/EEC as regards a prohibition measure adopted by the UK authorities in respect of protective clothing for fencers\n(notified under document C(2011) 268)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/49/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 7(1) of Directive 89/686/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (PPE) provides that where a Member State ascertains that personal protective equipment bearing the CE marking and used in accordance with its intended purpose could compromise the safety of persons, domestic animals or property, it shall take all necessary measures to remove such personal protective equipment from the market and to prohibit the placing on the market or free movement thereof.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 7(2) of the Directive, the Commission is required, after consulting the parties concerned, to declare whether it finds such a measure justified or not.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) in compliance with its obligations under the WTO agreements, Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 imposed a 15 % ad valorem additional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America as from 1 May 2005. In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions to the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the Community at that time.
(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2005 (1 October 2004-30 September 2005). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 36,91 million.
(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has increased, the first eight products of the list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be added to the list in Annex I to that Regulation.
(4) The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 36,91 million.
(5) Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 contain specific exemptions from the additional import duty. Since the applicability of those exemptions is dependent on certain conditions being met before the entry into force or on the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005, the exemptions cannot in practice apply for imports of the eight products now added to the list in Annex I. Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products.
(6) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2001 of 24 April 2001 reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications(1),
Having regard to the initiative of the Italian Republic,
Whereas:
(1) The European Councils of Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki have called on the Member States to develop their common visa policy further and to step up local consular cooperation between their representations in third countries.
(2) An analysis of the data concerning illegal immigration has shown that short-term visas (tourism, business, study, work or family visits) are the ones most often used for the purpose of regularly entering the territory of the Contracting Parties to the Schengen Convention and then going underground when the visa expires.
(3) In order to assess an immigration risk, it appears necessary further to step up local consular cooperation in determining what supplementary and/or additional documents should be required for issuing visas and as regards the adoption of common mechanisms for detecting false or falsified documents more effectively.
(4) Among the various factors on which the assessment of an immigration risk must be based, the outcome of the interview to which the visa applicant is subjected by the diplomatic mission or consular post is also of fundamental importance.
(5) Diplomatic missions and consular posts should therefore be in a position to exercise more effectively the powers they possess to assess an immigration risk.
(6) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. As this Decision builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether or not it will transpose it in into its national law.
(7) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(2), which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC(3) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(8) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 19 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(4); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(9) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(5); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 1 of 28 April 1970 laying down additional provisions for the common organisation of the market in wine, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1627/71 2, and in particular Article 9 (6) thereof;
Whereas the first subparagraph of Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 provides that where the free-at-frontier offer price for a wine, plus customs duties, is lower than the reference price for that wine, a countervailing charge equal to the difference between the reference price and the free-at-frontier offer price plus customs duties is to be levied on imports of that wine and of wines in the same category;
Whereas, however, that countervailing charge is not levied as regards third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee that the price of imports of products originating in and coming from their territory will not be lower than the reference price less customs duties and that any deflection of trade will be avoided;
Whereas the following have intimated their readiness to give that guarantee in respect of exports of certain wines to the Community:    - the Government of the Republic of Chile, by application dated 4 September 1970 ; and
- the Government of the State of Israel, by application dated 24 February 1971;
Whereas the Chilean Government will ensure that no exports to the Community are effected until the Central Bank has granted its authorisation after verifying that, for the wines in question, the free-at-Community-frontier price is not lower than the corresponding reference price applicable at the time of customs clearance, less customs duties;
Whereas the Israeli Government will ensure that no exports of wine to the Community are effected until an export licence has been issued by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, after the latter has verified that, for the wines in question, the ruling price is not lower than the corresponding reference price, applicable at the time of customs clearance, less customs duties;
Whereas furthermore the said Governments will ensure that any deflection of trade will be avoided ; whereas they will make any provisions necessary for this purpose and take all necessary steps to ensure that no action is taken which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the reference prices less customs duties, such as taking over marketing costs, resorting to linked transactions or any other action having similar effect;
Whereas they undertake to communicate regularly to the Commission details of wine exports to the Community and to enable the Commission to exercise continuous supervision of the effectiveness of the measures they have taken;
Whereas the Chilean and Israeli Governments have also undertaken to impose appropriate penalties on their exporters in order to ensure compliance with the provisions decided upon;
Whereas questions affecting observance of the guarantee given have been discussed in detail with the competent authorities of the Republic of Chile and of the State of Israel ; whereas, following these discussions, it may be assumed that Chile and Israel are in a position to abide by their guarantees ; whereas, consequently, there is no need to levy a  1OJ No L 99, 5.5.1970, p. 1. 2OJ No L 170, 29.7.1971, p. 3.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2) specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(3), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(4), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(5), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(6), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(7) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(8) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(9), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) 1763/92  of 29  June 1992 concerning financial cooperation in respect of all Mediterranean non-member countries
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament  (2),
Whereas, with a view to establishing a new Mediterranean policy, at its meeting held on 18 and 19  December 1990 the Council adopted a resolution concerning financial cooperation in respect of all  Mediterranean non-member countries;
Whereas in that resolution it was agreed, inter alia, that the measures implemented pursuant to the  financial protocols concluded with the Mediterranean non- member countries should be supplemented  by other types of measure, namely those the scope of which extends beyond the context of a single  country and those which concern the environment;
Whereas there should be a programme lasting five years (1992 to 1996);
Whereas an amount of ECU 230 million is deemed necessary, in terms of financial resources from the  budget, for implementing this multiannual programme, including ECU 25 million for risk capital;  whereas for 1992, under the current financial perspective, the amount deemed necessary is ECU 46  million;
Whereas the amounts to be committed for financing the programme for the period subsequent to 1992  will have to form part of the Community financial framework in force;
Whereas the Council has decided that the part of the loans granted by the European Investment Bank,  hereinafter referred to as 'the Bank`, from its own resources under conditions laid down by it, in  accordance with its Statute, in respect of environmental projects will receive an interest-rate  subsidy and whereas an amount should therefore be set aside from budgetary resources for that  purpose;
Whereas it is necessary to lay down the detailed arrangements and the rules governing cooperation  relating to measures financed from budgetary resources;
Whereas in loan operations involving interest-rate subsidies, the granting of a loan by the Bank  from its own resources and the granting of an interest-rate subsidy financed by the budgetary  resources of the Community must be linked and are conditional upon each other; whereas the Bank  may, in accordance with its Statute, and in particular by a unanimous decision of its Board of  Directors in the presence of an unfavourable opinion by the Commission, decide to grant a loan from  its own resources, subject to granting of the interest-rate subsidy; whereas, on account of this  aspect, it is necessary to ensure that the procedure adopted for granting interst-rate subsidies  results in every case in an express decision, whether to grant the subsidy or to refuse it, where  appropriate;
Whereas it is necessary to make provision for a Committee consisting of representatives of the  Member States to assist the Bank in the tasks attributed to it to implement this Regulation;
Whereas, for the purposes of adoption of this Regulation, the only powers provided for by the  Treaty are those under Article 235,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1763/92 of 29 June 1992 concerning financial cooperation in respect of all Mediterranean non-member countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104c(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas the second stage for achieving economic and monetary union started on 1 January 1994; whereas Article 109e(4) of the Treaty lays down that, in the second stage, Member States shall endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits;
Whereas there is an excessive deficit procedure which provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit and, after the excessive deficit has been corrected, for the abrogation of that decision; whereas, during the second stage, the excessive deficit procedure is determined by Article 104c of the Treaty, excluding paragraphs 1, 9 and 11; whereas the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure; whereas Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the said Protocol;
Whereas, following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104c(6) of the Treaty, the Council decided on 26 September 1994 that an excessive deficit existed in Italy; whereas, in accordance with Article 104c(7), the Council made recommendations to Italy with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end (2);
Whereas a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated, in accordance with the provisions of Article 104c(12) of the Treaty, to the extent that the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected;
Whereas, when abrogating the Decision, the Council is to act on a recommendation from the Commission; whereas, based on the data provided by the Commission after reporting by Italy before 1 March 1998 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 3605/93, the following conclusions are warranted:
Since 1993, the government deficit has been sharply reduced to 2,7 % of GDP in 1997, which is below the Treaty reference value; a further reduction to 2,5 % of GDP is forecast for 1998. The new medium-term financial programme 1998-2001 recently presented to Parliament by the Italian Government plans a further reduction of the general government deficit to 1,5 % of GDP in 2000 and 1 % of GDP in 2001.
The government debt ratio peaked in 1994 at 124,9 % of GDP and since then has declined each year to reach 121,6 % in 1997. The new medium-term financial programme plans a reduction of the debt ratio for 1998 to 118,2 % of GDP and a further decline in the following years. In 2001, the debt ratio is planned to reach 107 % of GDP. Such reduction will be helped by annual privatisation revenues amounting to 0,5 to 0,75 % of GDP, up to 2001. The Italian Government also announced its commitment to reduce the debt ratio below 100 % by 2003.
The reduction of the deficit and in particular the steady rise in the primary surplus, which reached over 6 % of GDP in 1997, have contributed to putting the debt ratio on a downward path. The Italian Government has recently reconfirmed its commitment to keeping the primary surplus at a level that contributes strongly to the decline of the debt ratio. This primary surplus is essential to maintaining the debt ratio on its sustainable downward path.
The deficit was below the Treaty reference value in 1997 and is expected to remain so in 1998 and to decline further in the medium term; the debt ratio has been decreasing in the last three years and is expected to decline at a more rapid pace in coming years,","{'title': '98/311/EC: Council Decision of 1 May 1998 abrogating the Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit for Italy', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Italy has been corrected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Italy is hereby abrogated.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 1 May 1998.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nG.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 5 July 2004
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece
(2004/917/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Greece,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit; the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of the said Protocol.
(4) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. The Commission addressed such an opinion on Greece to the Council on 24 June 2004. Having examined all relevant factors taken into account in its report in accordance with Article 104(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded in its opinion on 24 June 2004 that there exists an excessive deficit in Greece.
(5) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists.
(6) The overall assessment leads to the following conclusions: the general government deficit reached 3,2 % of GDP in 2003 in Greece. The breach of the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2003 did not result, in the sense of the Stability and Growth Pact, from an unusual event outside the control of the Greek authorities, nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn. On the contrary, it occurred in a context of strong economic growth at 4,2 % in 2003, and a positive output gap of around 1,5 % of GDP. The outturn of the general government deficit in 2003 compares with a target deficit of 0,9 % of GDP set in the December 2002 updated stability programme. According to the Commission, the significant slippage is attributed to extraordinary factors (overruns in expenditure related to the preparation of the Olympic Games and compensation for weather damages), to higher than planned current spending (social transfers and public sector wages) and to a shortfall of revenues (VAT, income taxes and reclassification, as a financial transaction, of a payment from the Saving Postal Bank to government).
(7) According to its spring 2004 forecasts, based on the assumption of no policy change and a deficit figure for 2003 of 2,95 % of GDP notified at the end of March, the Commission projects the general government deficit in Greece to reach 3,2 % of GDP in 2004.
(8) The debt-to-GDP ratio reached 103 % of GDP in 2003, well above the 60 % reference value of the Treaty. Moreover, in its Spring 2004 forecasts, the Commission projects the debt ratio to decline only marginally to 102,8 % of GDP in 2004, which is above the 98,3 % of GDP reported by the Greek authorities on 4 May 2004. The high level of government debt and its slow pace of reduction are a cause of concern, especially in a period of high nominal growth and positive and widening output gap.
(9) At present the quality of public finance data remains uncertain. The deficit figure for 2003 of 3,2 % of GDP in the notification of 4 May compares with a deficit of 1,7 % of GDP notified in early March, which was modified to 2,95 % of GDP at the end of the same month, following the new government’s initiative for a far-reaching auditing of public finances. Since open issues remained about the underlying data, the Greek authorities are committed to resolve most pending issues promptly in close collaboration with Eurostat. Moreover, although Eurostat validated the figures of the 4 May notification, there are firm indications that there will be significant further, and as regards deficits almost certainly upwards, revisions for 2003 and earlier years, when a customary notification is made in September 2004. Such revisions are moreover expected to have an upward impact on the deficit figures for 2004,","{'header': '30.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 389/25', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 5 July 2004\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece\n(2004/917/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit; the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of Salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents (1), and in particular Article 6(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The purpose of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 is to ensure that proper and effective measures are taken to detect and control Salmonella and other zoonotic agents at all relevant stages of production, processing and distribution, particularly at the level of primary production, in order to reduce their prevalence and the risk they pose to public health.
(2) That Regulation provides that Community targets are to be established for the reduction of the prevalence in certain animal populations of zoonoses and zoonotic agents listed in Annex I thereto.
(3) A Community target was established for the reduction of the prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in broilers at the level of primary production by Commission Regulation (EC) No 646/2007 of 12 June 2007 implementing Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards a Community target for the reduction of the prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in broilers (2).
(4) In order to achieve the Community target Member States are to establish national programmes for the control of Salmonella in flocks of broilers of Gallus gallus and submit them to the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3) and 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 12 November 2004, KWS SAAT AG and Monsanto Europe S.A. submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed produced from sugar beet H7-1 (the application).
(2) The initial scope of the application also included beet leaves and small pieces of roots resulting from the root processing that may be fermented to produce silage for animal feed. These products, which are not considered as produced from GMOs but as containing or consisting of GMOs, were removed from the scope of the application by the applicants on 14 February 2006.
(3) On 20 December 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products produced from sugar beet H7-1, as described in the application (the products) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses (2). In its opinion, EFSA considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States.
(4) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(5) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (3).
(6) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements, other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary.
(7) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(8) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(9) In accordance with Articles 4(2) and 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the conditions for authorisation of the products are binding all persons placing them on the market.
(10) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its chairman; the Commission has therefore submitted a proposal to the Council on 25 June 2007 in accordance with Article 5 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC (4), the Council being required to act within three months.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second and third indents of Article 15(8) and Article 16(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 314/2002 of 20 February 2002 laying down detailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector(3) provides that the basic production levy and the B levy together with, if required, the coefficient referred to in Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 for sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup shall be fixed before 15 October in respect of the preceding marketing year and, secondly, that the Member States shall determine for each undertaking the balance of the levies outstanding for payment.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1628/2001 of 9 August 2001 revising the maximum amount for the B production levy and amending the minimum price for B beet in the sugar sector for the marketing year 2001/02(4) increased, for the marketing year 2001/02, the maximum amount referred to in the first indent of Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar.
(3) For the marketing year 2001/02, the estimate of the overall loss recorded in accordance with Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 shall require, in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of that Article, the adoption of the maximum amounts of 2 % for the basic levy and 37,5 % for the B levy, fixed respectively in the first indent of the second subparagraph of paragraph 3 of that Article and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1628/2001.
(4) Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that an additional levy shall be charged where the overall loss recorded in accordance with Article 15(1) and (2) is not covered in its entirety by the receipts from the basic production levy and the B levy. For the marketing year 2001/02, as this uncovered overall loss amounts to EUR 63899203, the coefficient referred to in Article 16(2) of that Regulation should be fixed at an amount of 0,08319 which represents the ratio, less 1, between the abovementioned loss and revenue.
(5) Article 48 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides for the balance remaining from the compensation system for storage costs applied during the marketing year 2000/01 to be charged or credited, as appropriate, under the system referred to in Articles 15 and 16 of that Regulation for the marketing year 2001/02.
(6) The application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1667/2001 of 17 August 2001 postponing the date by which the sugar storage levy must be paid(5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1878/2001 of 26 September 2001 laying down transitional measures in connection with the compensation system for storage costs for sugar(6) produces a positive balance of EUR 31276971 for the compensation system for storage costs during the marketing year 2000/01.
(7) Since this positive balance comes from the storage levies paid by sugar-producing undertakings when disposing of their A and B sugar, provision should therefore be made for it to be reimbursed, on the basis of their production of A and B sugar in the marketing year 2001/02, to the undertakings in question which, in accordance with Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, bear the costs of the levies for that marketing year.

(4) An application for the extension of the existing entry for eprinomectin applicable to ovine species has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.
(5) According to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the establishment of a provisional MRL for eprinomectin for ovine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk, and the extrapolation of the MRLs for eprinomectin from ovine and bovine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk to caprine species, establishing a provisional MRL, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk.
(6) The CVMP recommended the establishment of a provisional MRL for ovine and caprine species as the scientific data is incomplete for the proposed analytical method for monitoring residues in ovine and caprine species.
(7) The entry for eprinomectin in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the provisional MRLs for ovine and caprine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk. The provisional MRLs set out in that Table for ovine and caprine species should expire on 1 July 2014.
(8) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 of 22 July 2008 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011 (1), and in particular Article 19(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, in particular Articles 9 and 10(6) thereof, the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as ‘Sri Lanka’) is a beneficiary country of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance granted within the European Union’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences.
(2) Commission Decision 2008/938/EC (2), which includes Sri Lanka in the list of countries beneficiary of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, noted that Sri Lanka’s fulfillment of the qualifying criteria for the arrangement relating to the three human rights conventions was the subject of an investigation initiated under Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (3).
(3) Reports, statements and information of the United Nations as well as other publicly available reports and information from other relevant sources, including non-governmental organisations, available to the European Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Commission’) indicated that the national legislation of Sri Lanka incorporating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, was not being effectively implemented. The three conventions mentioned are listed as core human rights conventions respectively in points 1, 5 and 6 of Annex III, Part A, to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008.
(4) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 provides for the temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance granted pursuant to that Regulation, in particular if the national legislation incorporating the conventions referred to in Annex III to that Regulation, which have been ratified in fulfilment of the requirements of Article 8(1) and (2) of that Regulation, is not effectively implemented.
(5) By Commission Decision 2008/803/EC (4), an investigation was initiated in order to establish ‘whether the national legislation of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka incorporating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child is effectively implemented’.
(6) Throughout the course of the investigation the Commission provided Sri Lanka with every opportunity to cooperate in the investigation, including by providing Sri Lanka with the opportunity to comment on the comprehensive findings of experts entrusted by the Commission to provide an independent legal assessment of the matters under the investigation. Despite the fact that Sri Lanka decided not to cooperate with, or participate in, the investigation, the Commission maintained regular contact with Sri Lanka outside the framework of the investigation so as to enable Sri Lanka to bring to the Commission’s attention any information relevant to the investigation. The information received in this context from Sri Lanka has been taken by the Commission fully into account and has contributed to inform its assessment.
(7) On 19 October 2009, the Commission approved a report containing its findings (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Report’). The Report concludes that the national legislation of Sri Lanka incorporating international human rights conventions, specifically the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, is not effectively implemented.
(8) Sri Lanka was provided with the Report containing the findings of the investigation and reminded that those findings constituted the basis on which the Commission intended to decide whether to recommend the temporary withdrawal of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance. Sri Lanka was also granted a period within which it could make representations on this matter or specifically in relation to the Report.
(9) Sri Lanka provided the Commission with a number of observations in respect of the subject-matter of the Report and conduct of the investigation. These observations covered also facts and findings on which Sri Lanka was given the opportunity to comment during the investigation but did not do so. The Commission nevertheless considered Sri Lanka’s observations carefully and in particular those relevant in the context of a decision on temporary withdrawal. The Commission’s assessment, of which Sri Lanka was informed, led to the conclusion that none of Sri Lanka’s arguments would substantively alter the findings of the investigation.
(10) The Commission has submitted the Report on the findings of the investigation to the Generalised Preferences Committee on 17 November 2009, in accordance with Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008.
(11) In the light of the foregoing, the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance should be withdrawn temporarily for all products originating in Sri Lanka, until it is decided that the reasons justifying the temporary withdrawal no longer prevail.
(12) This Regulation should enter into force 6 months after its adoption, unless the Council decides before then, upon a proposal from the Commission, that the reasons justifying it no longer prevail,","{'header': '20.2.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 45/1', 'title': 'IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 143/2010 OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 February 2010\ntemporarily withdrawing the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance provided for under Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 with respect to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008, in particular Articles 9 and 10(6) thereof, the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as ‘Sri Lanka’) is a beneficiary country of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance granted within the European Union’s scheme of generalised tariff preferences.\n\n((2)) Commission Decision 2008/938/EC(2), which includes Sri Lanka in the list of countries beneficiary of the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011, noted that Sri Lanka’s fulfillment of the qualifying criteria for the arrangement relating to the three human rights conventions was the subject of an investigation initiated under Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences(3).\n\n((3)) Reports, statements and information of the United Nations as well as other publicly available reports and information from other relevant sources, including non-governmental organisations, available to the European Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Commission’) indicated that the national legislation of Sri Lanka incorporating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, was not being effectively implemented.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required pursuant to Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopts a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (4), an initial list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period from 1994 to 1996; whereas this list has been enlarged by Decision 95/189/EC (5) as regards the zones eligible for Objective 2 in Sweden;
Whereas Article 9 (6) second subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 provides that, on an exceptional basis, the Commission can accede to a request from Austria, Finland or Sweden that assistance under Objective 2 be planned and implemented for the whole period from 1995 to 1999; whereas Sweden has requested implementation of this provision and accordingly the assistance under Objective 2 will cover the period 1995 to 1999;
Whereas the Swedish Government has submitted to the Commission on 16 June 1995 the single programming document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Ångermanlandskusten; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF);
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments, including the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as amended by the Act of Accession (8); whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (10), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (11), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (12), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the single programming document satisfies the conditions and includes the information required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas certain measures provided for in the present single programming document involve co-financing with existing aid schemes that were notified to the EFTA Surveillance Authority as existing aid on entry into force of the Agreement on the European Economic Area or have been approved by the EFTA Surveillance Authority or the Commission since 1 January 1994, or with new or altered aid schemes that have not yet been approved by the Commission; whereas the existing aid schemes will, if necessary, be brought into line with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty or replaced by other approved aid schemes;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (14), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Foot-and-mouth disease is a highly contagious viral disease in wild and domestic cloven-hoofed animals with a severe impact on the profitability of livestock farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other holdings keeping animals of susceptible species within the affected Member State, but also to other Member States and to third countries through movements of live susceptible animals or their products.
(3) Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 September 2003 on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease repealing Directive 85/511/EEC and Decisions 89/531/EEC and 91/665/EEC and amending Directive 92/46/EEC (2) sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak are to be implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus.
(4) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 14(2) of that Decision, Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease.
(5) Article 14(4) of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union.
(6) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3).
(7) Outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease occurred in Bulgaria in the first six months of 2011. Bulgaria took measures in accordance with Directive 2003/85/EC to combat those outbreaks.
(8) The authorities of Bulgaria were able to demonstrate through reports provided in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and continuous submission of information on the development of the disease situation that they have efficiently implemented the control measures provided for in Directive 2003/85/EC.
(9) The authorities of Bulgaria have therefore fulfilled their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 14(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 95/527/EC of 8 December 1995 on a Community financial contribution towards certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the monitoring and control systems applicable to the common fisheries policy(1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) When Commission Decision 98/439/EC on the eligibility of expenditure to be incurred by certain Member States in 1999 for the purpose of introducing monitoring and control systems applicable to the common fisheries policy(2), as amended by Decision 102(3), was adopted the available budget allocation was insufficient to grant the maximum Community financial contribution to all eligible expenditure.
(2) The budget allocation has now been increased so that an additional financial contribution is available for some eligible expenditure.
(3) Decision 1999/354/EC did not take account of the requests for assistance from France and Ireland because they were not sent to the Commission within the required deadlines. However, in order to ensure the continuity of monitoring and control activities in ICES zones VI, VII and VIII, it is essential that France and Ireland incur some expenditure which they cannot cover from their own budgets. Without any Community financial contribution the financing of investments programmed for 1999 would be seriously jeopardised and it would be impossible to attain the necessary monitoring and control objectives. It is therefore warranted to provide, exceptionally, for a financial contribution to the essential expenditure of France and Italy for 1999.
(4) Greece has forwarded additional information concerning its request for a financial contribution towards the expenditure referred to in Article 2 of Decision 95/527/EC for 1999 which will affect the amount of expenditure eligible for a financial contribution under that Decision.
(5) Commission Decision 1999/354/EC should therefore be amended.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the enzyme preparation 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 as a feed additive for salmonids, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) Its use was also provisionally authorised for salmonids by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 (2).
(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 for salmonids. The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 10 November 2010 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the phosphorus utilisation. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(7) In the interest of clarity, the entry on 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) produced by Aspergillus oryzae DSM 14223 in Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 should be deleted.

amending Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 (2) (the definitive Regulation), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels, originating in Thailand (the product concerned), normally declared within CN codes ex 2001 90 30 and ex 2005 80 00. Given the large number of cooperating parties, a sample of Thai exporting producers was selected during the investigation which led to the imposition of the measures.
(2) The sampled companies were attributed the individual duty rates established during the investigation. A countrywide duty of 12,9 %, based on the weighted average dumping margin of the sampled parties, was imposed on all other companies.
B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION
(3) On 30 August 2007, after the imposition of definitive measures on imports of sweetcorn originating in Thailand, Kuiburi Fruit Canning Co. Limited (Kuiburi or the company), an exporting producer which was not selected in the sample but which had provided the Commission with a full questionnaire reply and had requested an individual examination, submitted an application to the Court of First Instance. In that application, the company claimed that it should have been granted an individual examination.
(4) Without prejudice to the position which the Community institutions will take should that case be pursued by the applicant, the Commission decided on its own initiative to initiate a partial reopening of the anti-dumping investigation (3). The reopening was limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as Kuiburi is concerned.
(5) The Commission officially advised Kuiburi, the representatives of the exporting country and the Community industry of the partial reopening of the investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to be heard.
(6) The Commission sought to verify the information provided by Kuiburi which it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and a verification visit was carried out at the premises of the company.
(7) As set out in the definitive Regulation, the investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2005 (the investigation period or IP).
C.   FINDINGS
1.   Dumping
(8) The methodology used for the calculation of dumping was the same as that applied for the sampled companies, as described in recitals 21 to 36 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1888/2006 (4) (the provisional Regulation), and confirmed in the definitive Regulation.
(9) For the determination of normal value the Commission first established whether the total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with the company’s total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2), first sentence, of the basic Regulation, the domestic sales of the like product are considered to be representative if the company’s domestic sales volume exceeds 5 % of its total export sales to the Community.
(10) It was established that the like product was not sold at all on the domestic market. Therefore, normal value had to be constructed pursuant to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. Normal value was constructed by adding to the cost of manufacturing of each type exported to the Community, corrected where appropriate, a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and profit. As in the original investigation, it was decided not to establish the SG&A expenses and profit on the basis of Article 2(6)(a) of the basic Regulation, since only one company which had been included in the sample had representative domestic sales of the like product. Therefore, also in conformity with what was done in the original investigation, the SG&A expenses and profit were determined in accordance with Article 2(6)(b) as Kuiburi had representative sales, in the ordinary course of trade, of the same general category of products.
(11) The costs of manufacturing and SG&A expenses reported were found to be understated and were corrected before being used in constructing normal value.
(12) Following the disclosure of the essential facts and considerations forming the basis of the findings in this proceeding, Kuiburi claimed that in constructing normal value, the amounts for SG&A expenses and profit should be established pursuant to Article 2(6)(c) of the basic Regulation. The company argued that Article 2(6)(b) could not be used as the domestic sales of other products (i) included non-canned products and (ii) were in any case not representative. As concerns the first argument, the definition of the product concerned does not include any specific receptacle type and therefore is not limited to products packed in cans. By analogy, the same applies to the same general category of products. Concerning the second argument, it is to be noted that the 5 % threshold referred to in Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation serves to determine the representativity of domestic sales of the like product (as compared to sales of the product concerned to the Community). It is not required, for the application of Article 2(6)(b), that sales of the same general category of products represent more than that 5 % threshold. In any event, the company’s sales of the same general category of products as compared to the sales of the product concerned to the Community, are very significant and, therefore, representative. In view of the above, the company’s arguments cannot be accepted and it is confirmed that SG&A expenses and profit are established pursuant to Article 2(6)(b) of the basic Regulation.
(13) Kuiburi further submitted that if SG&A and profit were established pursuant to Article 2(6)(b) of the basic Regulation, a level of trade adjustment on the profit used for the construction of normal value would have to be made as it sells retailer branded products to the EC and a mix of own branded and retailer branded products domestically. In this respect it is important to note that Kuiburi had allocated the cost of sales on the basis of turnover. Consequently, the profit and SG&A amounted to the same combined level in the case of sales of all product types to all markets and the profit figures reported only reflected some slight variation in SG&A. It could therefore not be established that the reported figures reflected differences in the level of trade. As a consequence, no level of trade adjustment on the profit is warranted and Kuiburi’s argument is dismissed.
(14) All sales of the company were made directly to unrelated customers in the Community. For those sales, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of prices actually paid or payable by these independent customers in the Community.
(15) The comparison between normal value and export price was made on an ex-works basis. In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which affect price comparability. Allowances for differences in transport costs, handling costs, commissions, and credit costs were granted where applicable and justified.
(16) The SG&A used to construct normal value pursuant to the methodology set out above, included costs for commissions. Therefore, albeit that no claim had been made in this regard, an ex officio adjustment to the normal value pursuant to Article 2(10)(e) was made to reduce the SG&A by the amount of the costs incurred in respect of commissions.
(17) Kuiburi’s dumping margin was established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal value with a weighted average export price, in accordance with Article 2(11) and (12) of the basic Regulation.
(18) The comparison showed the existence of dumping. The weighted average dumping margin established for the company, expressed as a percentage of the cif Community-frontier price, amounts to 14,3 %.
2.   Injury elimination level
(19) In accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, the level of the anti-dumping measure should be sufficient to eliminate the injury to the Community industry caused by the dumped imports, without exceeding the dumping margin found. The calculation of the non-injurious price has been described in recitals 120 to 122 of the provisional Regulation.
(20) The necessary price increase was then determined on the basis of a comparison, per product type, of the weighted average import price, as established for the price undercutting calculations, with the non-injurious price of the like product sold by the Community industry on the Community market. Any difference resulting from this comparison was then expressed as a percentage of the total cif Community-frontier price.
(21) The above price comparison showed an injury margin of 17,5 %.
D.   MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES
(22) In the light of the results of the investigation, it is considered that a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed on exports of the product concerned by the company at the level of the dumping margin found, but, in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, should not be higher than the injury margin established for Kuiburi and presented in recital 21.
(23) Accordingly, the anti-dumping duty applicable to the cif Community-frontier price shall be 14,3 %. Since, pursuant to recital 57 of Regulation (EC) No 682/2007, the duty for the companies not cooperating in the investigation should be set at the level of the highest duty to be imposed on the companies cooperating in the investigation, that duty is now set at 14,3 %. However, since the reopening of the investigation did not have as its aim to include Kuiburi in the sample, but to perform an individual examination of Kuiburi on the basis of Article 17(3) of the basic Regulation, it would not be appropriate to recalculate the duty for the manufacturers listed in Annex I.
(24) Kuiburi and the Community Industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments,","{'header': '30.9.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 260/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 954/2008\nof 25 September 2008\namending Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain prepared or preserved sweetcorn in kernels originating in Thailand', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nNormal value\n\nExport price\n\nComparison\n\nDumping margin\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 682/2007 shall be replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, of the products described in paragraph 1 and produced by the companies below shall be as follows:\nCompany\nAnti-dumping duty (%)\nTARIC additional code\nKarn Corn Co., Ltd, 68 Moo 7 Tambol Saentor,\nThamaka, Kanchanaburi 71130, Thailand\n3,1\nA789\nKuiburi Fruit Canning Co., Ltd, 236 Krung Thon Muang Kaew Building, Sirindhorn Rd., Bangplad, Bangkok 10700, Thailand\n14,3\nA890\nMalee Sampran Public Co., Ltd, Abico Bldg. 401/1 Phaholyothin Rd., Lumlookka, Pathumthani 12130, Thailand\n12,8\nA790\nRiver Kwai International Food Industry Co., Ltd, 52 Thaniya Plaza, 21st.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For eugenol the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Implementing Decision 2011/266/EU (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 7 March 2008 an application from Eden Research PLC for the inclusion of the active substance eugenol in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Implementing Decision 2011/266/EU confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 30 June 2011.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance eugenol (4) on 15 October 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft assessment report was finalised on 17 May 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for eugenol.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing eugenol may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the use which was examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve eugenol.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing eugenol. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 149(4) and 150(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Decision No 1720/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 (3) established the action programme in the field of lifelong learning for the period 2007 to 2013.
(2) Article 9(2) of Decision No 1720/2006/EC stipulates that measures necessary for the implementation of the programme other than those listed in paragraph 1 are to be adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 10(3) of that Decision, namely in accordance with the advisory procedure established by Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 27 January 1986
approving aids from the French Republic to the coalmining industry during 1985
(Only the French text is authentic)
(86/25/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to Commission Decision 528/76/ECSC of 25 February 1976 regarding the Community system of measures taken by the Member States to assist the coalmining industry (1),
Having consulted the Council,
I
Whereas the Government of the French Republic has informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 2 of the above Decision, of the financial measures which it intends to implement directly or indirectly for the benefit of the coal industry during 1985; whereas of these measures the following may be approved pursuant to that Decision;
Whereas the Government of the French Republic intends to grant to Charbonnages de France for 1985 aid amounting to FF 3 283 900 000 to permit the economic restructuring of the coalfields to proceed in an appropriate manner;
Whereas the Government of the French Republic also proposes to grant to the central administration of Charbonnages de France in 1985 aid amounting to FF 467 600 000, to cover the charges incurred in borrowing, and transferred from the pits to the central administration of Charbonnages de France under the French Government's financial improvement scheme. Whereas this aid is paid not to the coalfields but only to the central administration of Charbonnages de France;
Whereas the abovementioned aids meet the criteria laid down in the Decision for the admissibility of such State assistance;
Whereas the aid of FF 3 751 500 000 proposed by the Government of the French Republic for 1985 to cover losses (of which FF 3 283 900 000, is to cover the coalfields' losses on mining and FF 467 600 000 to cover the losses sustained by the central administration of Charbonnages de France) will not be higher than the likely operating losses of Charbonnages de France;
Whereas the following points are relevant in connection with aid to the individual coalfields:
1. In 1985, aid to the Nord/Pas-de-Calais and Centre-Midi coalfields will be calculated in such a way that, as a result of the closure of further pits, there will be a reduction in production, which will mean that 428 fewer persons will be employed in the coal industry. The aids will prevent severe economic and social disruption in areas where there are not yet adequate opportunities for re-employment. The aids to these coalfields therefore comply with the provisions of the first subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (2) of the Decision.
2. The output planning of the Charbonnages de France in the Lorraine coalfields aims at long-term stabilization, since the coking coal produced in this coalfield is important for supplying the steel industry. The aid granted for this purpose complies with the second subparagraph of Article 12 (1) and Article 12 (3) of the Decision.
II
Whereas, under Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in 1985;
Whereas the sum of all these aids to support current production by the French coal industry is 567 800 000 ECU, or 36,87 ECU per tonne, for 1985; whereas this is higher than corresponding German and Belgian aids;
Whereas the following points must be made about the compatibility of the proposed aid with the proper functioning of the common market:
- there were no supply difficulties on the French coal market in 1985,
- French coal exports to the other Community countries fell in 1985 compared with 1984,
- hardly any price alignment agreements were entered into for French coal in 1985;
- industrial consumers of coal did not directly receive aid in 1985 through the prices of French coking coal and steam coal;
- the closure of one marginal pit in each of the Nord/Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine coalfields and two in the Centre-Midi resulted in rationalization and concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest;
Whereas it may accordingly be concluded that the aids proposed in 1985 for current production by the French coal industry are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;
Whereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to coal mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC (1);
III
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must satisfy itself that the approved aids are used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 of that Decision; whereas consequently the Commission is to be notified in particular of the amount of the aid and the manner in which it is apportioned,","{'title': '86/25/ECSC: Commission Decision of 27 January 1986 approving aids from the French Republic to the coalmining industry during 1985 (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe French Republic is hereby authorized to grant to the coal industry the following aids for 1985:\n\n(a) an amount not exceeding FF 3 283 900 000 to cover losses on mining;\n\n(b) an amount not exceeding FF 467 600 000 to cover the financial losses sustained by the central administration of Charbonnages de France.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Government of the French Republic shall notify the Commission by 31 March 1986 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 January 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nNicolas MOSAR\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 63, 11. 3. 1976, p. 1.\n\n(1) OJ No 259, 15. 9. 1973, p. 36.'}]}"

Whereas the conservation of the forest ecosystems is important for its economic, ecological and social functions and contributes, in particular, towards safeguarding the social function for those people working in agriculture and rural areas;
Whereas the Community and the Member States have committed themselves at international level at the pan-European Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe, held in Strasbourg in 1990 and in Helsinki in 1993, for a continuing forest damage survey; whereas the scheme provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 contributes to the fulfilment of this commitment;
Whereas results from the systematic survey network show obvious trends in spatial and temporary distribution of forest damage over the entire area of the Community;
Whereas plots for the intensive and continuous monitoring of forest ecosystems have been set up by the Member States; whereas a continuation of this monitoring activity over a longer period will improve the understanding of the causal relationship between changes in forest ecosystems and the factors influencing it;
Whereas forest damage due to various factors, notably atmospheric pollution and certain unfavourable meteorological events, are problematic for the development of a sustainable agriculture and the management of rural areas;
Whereas consequently the protection of forests against atmospheric pollution and certain unfavourable meteorological factors contributes directly to the achievement of the objectives laid down in Article 39 (1) (b) of the Treaty;
Whereas consequently the scheme provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 3528/86 should be continued and its duration extended for five years, its period of application thereby being extended to fifteen years as from 1 January 1987;
Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995, is included in this Regulation for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty;

Whereas the period fixed in Article 90 of the Act of Accession was extended to 31 December 1988 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4007/87 (1);
Whereas the liberalization of trade as a result of accession has enabled the operators in other Member States which, unlike those in third countries, may dispose without any restriction of the products in question on the Spain market, to market substantial quantitites of pigmeat in Spain; whereas that situation has created economic difficulties for pig producers in Spain by aggravating the problems observed on the market following the sharp increase in national production recorded in recent years; whereas those difficulties are sufficiently serious to justify the introduction of transitional measures to alleviate the situation of those producers;
Whereas, to that end, a mechanism for the surveillance of the release for consumption in Spain of products coming from other Member States may turn out to be suitable for as long as prices on the market in that country are depressed; whereas provision should therefore be made for transitional measures to take that form; whereas such a mechanism may be managed suitably on the basis of certificates issued by the Spanish authorities under a procedure enabling the Commission to assess the risks of disturbance of the Spanish market connected with the quantities which it is contemplated releasing for consumption and to take, as the case may be, suitable special measures;

(2) The Stockholm Programme — An open and secure Europe serving and protecting citizens highlighted trafficking in firearms among the threats to the EU’s internal security (2).
(3) In order to ensure that the Commission is able to call upon the expertise of specialists on matters concerning trafficking in firearms, developments in related security threats and the evolving requirements of competent authorities, it is necessary to set up a group of experts in this field, and to define its tasks and its structure.
(4) The group should help to develop and disseminate guidance on best practice in the area of the fight against the illicit trafficking in firearms at an operational level, and to review the effectiveness of that guidance.
(5) The group should be composed of experts from the internal security field, including producers of firearms and researchers and any other individuals who in the Commission’s view offer valuable expertise which may assist the Commission with possible drafting legislative proposals and policy initiatives to improve measures against this illicit trafficking in firearms to safeguard the EU's internal security.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 9 October 2007
abrogating Decision 2006/125/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in the United Kingdom
(2007/738/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In its Decision 2006/125/EC (1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in the United Kingdom. The Council noted that in financial year 2004/2005 (2) the general government deficit was 3,2 % of GDP, above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value, while general government gross debt stood at 40,8 % of GDP, well below the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value.
(2) On 24 January 2006, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (3), the Council made, based on a recommendation from the Commission, a recommendation addressed to the United Kingdom that the excessive deficit situation should be brought to an end by 2006/2007 at the latest. The recommendation was made public.
(3) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(4) In accordance with the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4). In view of the fact that the data notified in March 2007 for budgetary year 2006/2007 were government projections, the United Kingdom submitted in the context of its excessive deficit procedure a supplementary notification. This, received on 16 July 2007, reports actual outturns for 2006/2007, which has enabled the Commission to assess budgetary developments in the United Kingdom relative to the Council recommendation on bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2006/2007 at the latest.
(5) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 8g(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 following the notification by the United Kingdom on 16 July 2007 and on the Commission services' spring 2007 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:
— the general government deficit was reduced from 3,2 % of GDP in 2005/2006 to 2,7 % in 2006/2007, below the 3 % of GDP deficit reference value. This is slightly below the projection of 2,8 % of GDP set in the December 2005 update of the United Kingdom's convergence programme,
— fiscal consolidation in 2006/2007 resulted from an increase in the revenue ratio of 0,4 percentage points of GDP, especially through higher corporate tax revenues. Total government expenditure between 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 grew in line with nominal GDP, although capital spending was lower than projected in the December 2006 convergence programme and current expenditure higher. Compared with 2005/2006, during which year the imputation of a one-off transaction reduced the deficit by 0,3 % of GDP, the improvement in the structural balance (i.e. the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) in 2006/2007 is estimated at 0,7 % of GDP,
— for 2007/2008, in line with the deficit projection published in the Budget of March 2007, the Commission services' spring 2007 forecast projects the deficit to be reduced further, to 2,6 % of GDP, driven by a rise in the revenue ratio, specifically the tax burden, which is however almost completely offset by a rise in the expenditure ratio. This deficit ratio is higher than the official deficit projection of 2,3 % of GDP set in the December 2006 update of the convergence programme, on account of a downward revision in corporate taxation revenue. For 2008/2009, the spring forecast projects, on a no-policy change basis, a further decline in the deficit to 2,4 % of GDP. This profile indicates that the deficit has been brought below the 3 % of GDP ceiling in a credible and sustainable manner. In structural terms, the general government deficit is projected to fall by 0,2 percentage points of GDP in 2007/2008 and, on a no-policy change basis, by 0,3 percentage points in 2008/2009. This indicates a rather modest path of future consolidation relative to the favourable economic environment forecast,
— government debt increased from 39,6 % of GDP in 2004/2005 to 42,5 % in 2006/07. According to the Commission services' spring 2007 forecast, the debt ratio is projected to increase to around 43,9 % by end-March 2009, but remaining well below the 60 % of GDP reference value. A further strengthening of the fiscal position beyond that forecast for 2008/2009 will be required to halt the increase in the debt ratio.
(6) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in the United Kingdom has been corrected and Decision 2006/125/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '17.11.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 300/49', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 9 October 2007\nabrogating Decision 2006/125/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in the United Kingdom\n(2007/738/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In its Decision 2006/125/EC(1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, the Council decided that an excessive deficit existed in the United Kingdom. The Council noted that in financial year 2004/2005(2)the general government deficit was 3,2\xa0% of GDP, above the 3\xa0% of GDP Treaty reference value, while general government gross debt stood at 40,8\xa0% of GDP, well below the 60\xa0% of GDP Treaty reference value.\n\n((2)) On 24 January 2006, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(3), the Council made, based on a recommendation from the Commission, a recommendation addressed to the United Kingdom that the excessive deficit situation should be brought to an end by 2006/2007 at the latest. The recommendation was made public.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.\n\n((4)) In accordance with the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(4). In view of the fact that the data notified in March 2007 for budgetary year 2006/2007 were government projections, the United Kingdom submitted in the context of its excessive deficit procedure a supplementary notification. This, received on 16 July 2007, reports actual outturns for 2006/2007, which has enabled the Commission to assess budgetary developments in the United Kingdom relative to the Council recommendation on bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2006/2007 at the latest.\n\n((5)) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 8g(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 following the notification by the United Kingdom on 16 July 2007 and on the Commission services' spring 2007 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:—the general government deficit was reduced from 3,2\xa0% of GDP in 2005/2006 to 2,7\xa0% in 2006/2007, below the 3\xa0% of GDP deficit reference value. This is slightly below the projection of 2,8\xa0% of GDP set in the December 2005 update of the United Kingdom's convergence programme,—fiscal consolidation in 2006/2007 resulted from an increase in the revenue ratio of 0,4 percentage points of GDP, especially through higher corporate tax revenues. Total government expenditure between 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 grew in line with nominal GDP, although capital spending was lower than projected in the December 2006 convergence programme and current expenditure higher. Compared with 2005/2006, during which year the imputation of a one-off transaction reduced the deficit by 0,3\xa0% of GDP, the improvement in the structural balance (i.e. the cyclically-adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) in 2006/2007 is estimated at 0,7\xa0% of GDP,—for 2007/2008, in line with the deficit projection published in the Budget of March 2007, the Commission services' spring 2007 forecast projects the deficit to be reduced further, to 2,6\xa0% of GDP, driven by a rise in the revenue ratio, specifically the tax burden, which is however almost completely offset by a rise in the expenditure ratio.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products in the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 602/2001(4).
(3) As far as wheat and rye flour, groats and meal are concerned, when the refund on these products is being calculated, account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture. These quantities were fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1134/2002 of 27 June 2002 fixing the export refunds on cereals and on wheat or rye flour, groats and meal', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, excluding malt, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 July 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 June 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 7.\n\n(4) OJ L 89, 29.3.2001, p. 16.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 27 June 2002 fixing the export refunds on cereals and on wheat or rye flour, groats and meal\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2000 (OJ L 243, 28.9.2000, p. 14) as amended.\n\nThe other destinations are as follows:\n\nC01 All destinations except for Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Hungary.\n\nC06 All destinations except for Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Hungary.\n\nC07 All destinations except for Estonia, Latvia and Hungary.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000 (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 provides for unlimited duty-free access to the Community market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.
(2) A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part was signed in Luxemburg on 15 October 2007. Pending the completion of the procedures necessary for its entry into force, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part was signed and concluded and entered into force on 1 January 2008 (2).
(3) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement establish a contractual trade regime between the Community and Montenegro. The bilateral trade concessions on the Community side are equivalent to the concessions applicable within the unilateral autonomous trade measures under Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 to take into account these developments. In particular it is appropriate to remove Montenegro from the list of beneficiaries of the tariff concessions granted for the same products under the contractual regime. In addition, it is necessary to adjust the global tariff quota volumes for specific products for which tariff quotas have been granted under the contractual regimes.
(5) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1398/2007 (3), Montenegro and Kosovo (4) have been removed from the scope of application of the Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (5); Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 has therefore become obsolete and should be deleted.
(6) Montenegro will remain beneficiary of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 insofar as that Regulation provides for concessions which are more favourable than the concessions existing under the contractual regime.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, referred to in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000,","{'header': '8.5.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 122/7', 'title': ""COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 407/2008\nof 7 May 2008\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 provides for unlimited duty-free access to the Community market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.\n\n((2)) A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part was signed in Luxemburg on 15 October 2007.

Whereas, however, the positive role played by this system in improving access for the developing countries to the markets of the preference-giving countries was recognized at the ninth session of the UNCTAD Special Committee on Preferences; whereas it  was there agreed that the objectives of the system of generalized preferences would not be fully achieved by the end of 1980, and that consequently it should be prolonged beyond the initial period, an overall review of the system having started in 1990;
Whereas the review of the system has continued into 1991 and the progress of the work makes it unlikely that a scheme based on new guidelines would be established by 1 January 1992; whereas, however, this review is envisaged during 1992;
Whereas pending the results of such review the 1991 generalized preferences scheme should be extended by way of derogation on a provisional basis into 1992;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 48 (3) (d) thereof, and Article 2 of the Protocol on the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 (2) of 15 October 1968 and Council Directive No 68/360/EEC of 15 October 1968 (3) enabled freedom of movement for workers to be secured at the end of a series of measures to be achieved progressively ; whereas the right of residence acquired by workers in active employment has as a corollary the right, granted by the Treaty to such workers, to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State ; whereas it is important to lay down the conditions for the exercise of such right;
Whereas the said Council Regulation and Council Directive contain the appropriate provisions concerning the right of workers to reside in the territory of a Member State for the purposes of employment ; whereas the right to remain, referred to in Article 48 (3) (d) of the Treaty ; is interpreted therefore as the right of the worker to maintain his residence in the territory of a Member State when he ceases to be employed there;
Whereas the mobility of labour in the Community requires that workers may be employed successively in several Member States without thereby being placed at a disadvantage;
Whereas it is important, in the first place, to guarantee to the worker residing in the territory of a Member State the right to remain in that territory when he ceases to be employed in that State because he has reached retirement age or by reason of permanent incapacity to work ; whereas, however, it is equally important to ensure that right for the worker who, after a period of employment and residence in the territory of a Member State, works as an employed person in the territory of another Member State, while still retaining his residence in the territory of the first State;
Whereas, to determine the conditions under which the right to remain arises, account should be taken of the reasons which have led to the termination of employment in the territory of the Member State concerned and, in particular, of the difference between retirement, the normal and foreseeable end of working life, and incapacity to work which leads to a premature and unforeseeable termination of activity ; whereas special conditions must be laid down where termination of activity is the result of an accident at work or occupational disease, or where the worker's spouse is or was a national of the Member State concerned;
Whereas the worker who has reached the end of his working life should have sufficient time in which to decide where he wishes to establish his final residence;
Whereas the exercise by the worker of the right to remain entails that such right shall be extended to members of his family ; whereas in the case of the death of the worker during his working life, maintenance of the right of residence of the members of his family must also be recognised and be the subject of special conditions;
Whereas persons to whom the right to remain applies must enjoy equality of treatment with national workers who have ceased their working lives;  (1)OJ No C 65, 5.6.1970, p. 16.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (1), and in particular Article 164(2), and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XV of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Union market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be set in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167, 168 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).

Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species (1), as last amended by Directive 86/155/EEC (2), and in particular Article 15 (2), (3) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to the application lodged by the United Kingdom,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Directive 70/457/EEC, seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1985 in at least one of the Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in Directive 70/457/EEC is, with effect from 31 December 1987, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to the variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of Directive 70/457/EEC provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the United Kingdom has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species;
Whereas the varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official trials in the United Kingdom;
Whereas, in respect of the variety Alban (white clover) the results of the trials show that in the United Kingdom, when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there, which apply within the framework of current Community provisions, it is not distinct from varieties accepted there (Article 15 (3) (a), first case of Directive 70/457/EEC);
Whereas, therefore the application for the United Kingdom in respect of this variety should be granted in full;
Whereas the application for other varieties is now being carefully examined by the Commission; whereas it is impossible to complete examination of the variety Minaret (Italian rye-grass) and Entrar (perennial rye-grass) before the time limit specified in Article 15 (1) of Directive 70/457/EEC;
Whereas the time limit in question should therefore, where the United Kingdom is concerned, be extended for an appropriate period in order to allow complete examination of the application in respect of these varieties (Article 15 (7) of Directive 70/457/EEC);

","Directive 2000/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 18 September 2000
on energy efficiency requirements for ballasts for fluorescent lighting
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) It is important to promote measures aimed at ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market which, at the same time, promote energy-saving, environmental protection and consumer protection.
(2) Fluorescent lighting accounts for a significant share of electricity consumption in the Community and thus of total energy consumption. The various models of ballasts for fluorescent lighting available on the Community market have very different levels of consumption for a given type of lamp, i.e. extremely variable energy efficiency.
(3) This Directive aims at reducing energy consumption for ballasts for fluorescent lighting by moving gradually away from the less efficient ballasts, and towards the more efficient ballasts which may also offer extensive energy-saving features.
(4) Some Member States are on the point of adopting provisions relating to the efficiency of ballasts for fluorescent lighting, which might create barriers to trade in these products in the Community.
(5) It is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection. This Directive ensures a high level of protection for both the environment and the consumer, in aiming at a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of ballasts.
(6) In accordance with the subsidiarity and proportionality principles laid down by Article 5 of the Treaty, as the objectives of this action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, they can, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(7) An effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that this Directive is implemented properly, guarantees fair conditions of competition for producers and protects consumer rights.
(8) Council Decision 93/465/EEC of 22 July 1993 concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures and the rules for the affixing and use of the CE conformity marking, which are intended to be used in the technical harmonisation directives(4), applies, except as regards marking and withdrawal from the market, where departure to a limited extent from the Decision is justified by the type of product and the specific market situation.
(9) In the interest of international trade, international standards should be used wherever appropriate. The electricity consumption of a ballast is defined by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation Standard EN 50294 of December 1998, which is based on international standards.
(10) Ballasts for fluorescent lighting complying with the energy efficiency requirements of this Directive must bear the ""CE"" marking and associated information, in order to enable them to move freely.

Having regard to the request submitted by France,
Whereas:
(1) In the Community, in particular in France, the production of certain vine propagating materials satisfying the requirements of Directive 68/193/EEC has been insufficient in 1998 and is therefore not adequate to meet that country's needs.
(2) It is not possible to cover this demand satisfactorily with material satisfying all the requirements laid down in the said Directive.
(3) France should therefore be authorised to permit the marketing for a period expiring on 15 March 2001 of material of a category to which less stringent requirements apply.
(4) Other Member States likely to supply France with such material should furthermore be authorised to permit its marketing to this end.
(5) In France the propagating material will be imported from Switzerland in the form of dormand buds to be used for grafting. According to the request, the rooted grafts produced in the Community from such propagating material are then intended for re-export to Switzerland.
(6) This authorisation may only be used in accordance with the plant health conditions and requirements laid down by Council Directive 2000/29/EC(3), and in any implementing measures made thereof.

of 17 December 2013
amending Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), and in particular Article 247 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Non-preferential rules of origin are to be applied to all non-preferential trade policy measures, including anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
(2) In Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92, the basic principle is laid down that goods whose production involved more than one country are to be deemed to originate in the country where they underwent their last, substantial, economically justified processing or working in an undertaking equipped for that purpose and resulting in the manufacture of a new product or representing an important stage of manufacture.
(3) The declaration for free circulation of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels and their key components has been made subject to provisional anti-dumping duties by Commission Regulation (EU) No 513/2013 (2).
(4) In order to ensure the correct and uniform implementation of the provisional anti-dumping duties, a detailed rule for the interpretation of the principle of Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 for the determination of the origin of the products covered by those measures needs to be laid down with regard to crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels and one of their key components, crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells.
(5) The production process of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels can be divided into the following major steps: production of silicon wafers; processing of silicon wafers into crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells; assembly of several crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells into a crystalline silicon photovoltaic module or panel.
(6) The most important stage in the manufacture of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels or modules is the processing of silicon wafers into crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. That is the decisive production stage during which the use to which the component parts of the panel or module are to be put becomes definite and where they are given their specific qualities.
(7) That transformation therefore should be considered as constituting the last substantial transformation in the production process of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92. The country of manufacture of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells should thus be the country of non-preferential origin of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels.
(8) By Decision 94/800/EC (3) the Council approved, inter alia, the Agreement on Rules of Origin (WTO-GATT 1994), annexed to the final act signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994. According to the principles laid down in that Agreement for the Harmonisation Work Program, the determination of the country where goods underwent their last substantial transformation should first of all be based on the country where the production process has led to a change in tariff classification. Only where that criterion does not allow to determine the country of last substantial transformation can other criteria be used, such as a value added criterion or the determination of a specific processing operation. It is appropriate to use the same principles in the EU customs legislation.
(9) Crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells are classified in heading 8541 of the Harmonised System (HS). Crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels are classified in the same heading. The input material, silicon wafers, is classified in HS heading 3818. The rule based on a change of tariff heading thus adequately expresses the last substantial transformation of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells. At the same time it excludes the assembly of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels or modules from cells to confer origin to the final product, as both panels and cells are classified in the same heading.
(10) An origin rule based on added value, which is usually combined with the change of tariff heading rule for the determination of products for which the last transformation is an assembly operation, is not appropriate in the case of crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels, as the necessary predictability and legal certainty would be better attained for those particular products by identifying the most significant production step.
(11) A so-called ‘residual’ rule is necessary in order to determine the origin of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels or modules where the primary rule of change in tariff heading is not fulfilled. In that case, the origin of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells or of the major portion in value of the crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells should constitute the origin of the panel or module.
(12) Crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules or panels may also be classified under certain conditions in HS heading 8501. A similar rule as for HS heading 8541 should also be laid down for those crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels or modules.
(13) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (4) should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the German Government has submitted to the Commission on 22 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the areas of  the Land Schleswig-Holstein concerned by Objective 2; whereas this document contains the elements  referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation  (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant  to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a  single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole  programmation period;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been  complied with,","{'title': '94/1052/EC: Commission Decision of 16 December 1994 on the approval of the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the areas of the Land Schleswig-Holstein concerned by Objective 2 in Germany (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance  in the areas of the Land Schleswig-Holstein concerned by Objective 2 in Germany, covering the  period 1 January 1994 to 31 December 1996, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Single Programming Document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an  appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional  policies in Germany;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. investments in infrastructures to reclaim industrial sites and facilities for employment and  qualification schemes;\n\n2. promotion of growth and stability in employment and strengthening of labour potential in  research, science and technology;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the Single Programming Document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the financial implementation provisions,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality and an initial evaluation of the latter;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the  Single Programming Document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or  adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nFor the purpose of indexation, the annual breakdown of the global maximal allocation  foreseen for the assistance from the Structural Funds is as follows:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the Single  Programming Document amounts to a maximum of ECU 15,393 million.\n\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the  Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed  implementing provisions which form an integral part of the Single Programming Document.\n\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 16,5 million for the  public sector and ECU 0,1 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans, in  particular from the ECSC and EIB.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas, on 28 April 1987, the German Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet, hereinafter referred to as 'the programme'; whereas it forwarded at a later date additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the programme fulfills the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources was introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 (2);
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 is aimed at facilitating the structural development of the fisheries sector within the framework of the guidelines of the common fisheries policy; whereas such structural development may be encouraged by appropriate measures supported with Community financial aid;
Whereas such measures should help to create a fishing fleet that is adapted to likely medium-term catch opportunities in both Community and non-Community waters; whereas these measures should, in particular, be based on an attempt to ensure balanced exploitation of internal resources in Community waters;
Whereas the measures implemented under the Community rules adopted for the decade from 1987 to 1997 are a continuation of the efforts made since 1983 to improve the structural situation up to 31 December 1986 through common measures to restructure, modernize and develop the fisheries sector; whereas, therefore, the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decisions 85/277/EEC (3) and 87/37/EEC (4) constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the effort still needed to ensure that the Community objectives are achieved;
Whereas the objectives of the guidance programme for 1986 have not been fully achieved; whereas the current or likely situation as regards availabilities in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned do not allow for any adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved; whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1987 to 1991;
Whereas these forecasts could be reviewed were there to be any significant change in availabilities, backed up by scientific evidence, and in the light of the development of international fishery relations between the Community and coastal third States;
Whereas, in addition, the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme period between fishing capacities and availabilities;
Whereas the desired structural adjustments should be implemented on a gradual and continuing basis to reduce the economic and social impact they may have to a minimum;
Whereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken under this programme may not warrant public financial assistance; whereas, in this context, approval of the programme should only be effective where the limitations and conditions upon which such approval was made conditional are complied with;

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
(3) The application of the above criteria gives the world market price for unginned cotton determined hereinafter,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1606/2003 of 12 September 2003 determining the world market price for unginned cotton', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe world price for unginned cotton as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 is hereby determined as equalling EUR 29,541/100 kg.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 13 September 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 12 September 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992, laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (2), and in particular Article 17(3)(a) thereof,

(2) In accordance with Article 13(1)(c) of Directive 90/426/EEC and point 2 of Part A of Chapter II of Annex D to Directive 92/65/EEC, equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species must come from third countries or parts of their territory, which have been free of glanders for at least 6 months.
(3) On 5 September 2008, Brazil notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the confirmation of a case of glanders in a horse in the suburbs of São Paulo in the State of São Paulo. In order to allow the importation of equidae, their semen, ova and embryos to continue from the disease free parts of the territory of Brazil, the Commission adopted Decision 2008/804/EC (4) excluding the State of São Paulo from the list of territories of Brazil set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.
(4) In the light of the information and guarantees provided by Brazil, and taking into account that at least 6 months have elapsed since the case of glanders was detected and the infected animal destroyed, the State of São Paulo should be reinstated in the list of territories of Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC in order to allow the importation of equidae and imports of semen, ova and embryos of equine species to resume from this part of the territory of Brazil. The entry for Brazil in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Those conditions require amongst others a complete residence period of 3 months and a pre-export isolation in an approved isolation centre protected from vector insects to avoid the introduction of disease into the Community.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 144(1) and Article 148 thereof, in conjunction with Article 4,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 (2) opens on a multiannual basis an autonomous import tariff quota for import of 20 000 tonnes of high-quality beef. Article 2 of that Regulation provides that the tariff quota is to be managed by the Commission in accordance with Article 144 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Detailed rules should therefore be adopted for the administration of that quota.
(2) That quota should be managed using import licences. Therefore, rules should be laid down concerning the submission of applications and the information to be provided in the applications and licences. Where necessary, that can be done by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (4).
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (5) lays down detailed rules concerning the applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued for the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in this Regulation.
(4) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, it is appropriate to sub-divide each import tariff quota period into several sub-periods.
(5) The release into free circulation of the products imported under the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 should be subject to a presentation of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authority of the exporting third country. The issue of such certificates of authenticity should guarantee that the imported products qualify as high-quality beef as defined in this Regulation. The form and layout of the certificates of authenticity and the procedures for using those certificates should be specified. Certificates should be issued by authorities in third countries affording all the necessary guarantees to ensure that the arrangements concerned are properly applied.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 provides that the import tariff quota is opened from 1 August 2009. Therefore, this Regulation should also apply from the same day.

Where necessary, that can be done by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(3), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 382/2008 of 21 April 2008 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector(4).\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences(5)lays down detailed rules concerning the applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. That Regulation limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued for the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in this Regulation.\n\n((4)) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, it is appropriate to sub-divide each import tariff quota period into several sub-periods.\n\n((5)) The release into free circulation of the products imported under the quota covered by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 should be subject to a presentation of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authority of the exporting third country. The issue of such certificates of authenticity should guarantee that the imported products qualify as high-quality beef as defined in this Regulation. The form and layout of the certificates of authenticity and the procedures for using those certificates should be specified. Certificates should be issued by authorities in third countries affording all the necessary guarantees to ensure that the arrangements concerned are properly applied.\n\n((6)) Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 provides that the import tariff quota is opened from 1 August 2009. Therefore, this Regulation should also apply from the same day.\n\n((7)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter and scope', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Regulation lays down rules for the administration of import tariff quota of high-quality beef as provided for in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, hereinafter referred to as ‘the tariff quota’.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Regulation shall apply to high-quality fresh, chilled or frozen beef that fulfils the requirements laid down in Annex I.\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, ‘frozen meat’ means meat with an internal temperature of –\xa012\xa0°C or lower when it enters the customs territory of the Community.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Regulations (EC) No 1301/2006, (EC) No 376/2008, and (EC) No 382/2008 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Administration of the tariff quota', 'text': 'Article 2\nAdministration of the tariff quota\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The tariff quota shall be administered by applying the simultaneous examination method in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The rate of the import duty, referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009, shall be mentioned in section 24 of the import licence application and the import licence as provided for in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The quota year provided for in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 shall be divided into 12 monthly sub-periods.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), and in particular Articles 2 and 3 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) All pharmacologically active substances used in the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for food-producing animals should be evaluated in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(2) The substance cyfluthrin is currently included in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for bovine species for muscle, fat, liver and kidney and for bovine species for milk provided that, for milk, the further provisions in Council Directive 94/29/EC of 23 June 1994 amending the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 86/363/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals and foodstuffs of animal origin respectively (2) are observed. Following a request to extend the existing entry for cyfluthrin for bovine species in Annex I to all ruminants, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (hereinafter CVMP), having reviewed the maximum residue limits (hereinafter MRLs) already established for the substance cyfluthrin, concluded that the existing MRLs for bovine species could not be extrapolated to all ruminants, as residue data from ovine species was not available. The CVMP concluded that the extrapolation was possible for caprine species only. As a consequence, it is considered appropriate to extend the current entry in Annex I of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for cyfluthrin to include caprine species, with the same MRLs values as for bovine species, for muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk, provided that, for milk, the further provisions in Directive 94/29/EC are observed.
(3) Lectin extracted from red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) is currently not included in the Annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90. Following an examination of an application for the establishment of MRLs for lectin extracted from red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) in porcine species, the CVMP concluded that there is no need to establish MRLs for lectin extracted from red kidney beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and recommended the inclusion of that substance in Annex II for porcine species, for oral use only. As a consequence, it is found appropriate to insert this substance in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for porcine species, for oral use only.
(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (3) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

As a consequence, it is found appropriate to insert this substance in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for porcine species, for oral use only.\n\n((4)) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((5)) An adequate period should be allowed before the applicability of this Regulation in order to enable Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary in the light of this Regulation to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products(3)to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnexes I and II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 16 August 2008.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nA.\nIn point 2.2.3 of Annex I (List of pharmacologically active substances for which maximum residue limits have been fixed), the entry for ‘Cyfluthrin’ is replaced by the following:\n2.2.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Pyrethroids\nPharmacologically active substance(s)\nMarker residue\nAnimal species\nMRLs\nTarget tissues\nOther provisions\n‘Cyfluthrin\nCyfluthrin (sum of isomers)\nBovine, caprine\n10  μg/kg\nMuscle\n50  μg/kg\nFat\n10  μg/kg\nLiver\n10  μg/kg\nKidney\n20  μg/kg\nMilk\nFurther provisions in Directive 94/29/EC are to be observed’\nB.\nIn point 6 of Annex II (List of substances not subject to maximum residue limits), the following substance is inserted:\n6.\xa0\xa0\xa0Substances of vegetable origin\nPharmacologically active substance(s)\nAnimal species\nOther provisions\n‘Lectin extracted from red kidney beans\n(Phaseolus vulgaris)\nPorcine\nFor oral use only’'}]}"

amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include 1-methylcyclopropene as active substance
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 28 February 2002 an application from Rohm and Haas France S.A. for the inclusion of the active substance 1-methylcyclopropene in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2003/35/EC (2) confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member States submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on 22 March 2003.
(3) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group Evaluation and presented to the Commission on 14 January 2005 in the format of the EFSA Scientific Report for 1-methylcyclopropene (3). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 23 September 2005 in the format of the Commission review report for 1-methylcyclopropene.
(4) The review of 1-methylcyclopropene did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants or of the European Food Safety Authority which has taken over the role of that Committee.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include 1-methylcyclopropene in Annex I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(6) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing provisional authorisations of plant protection products containing 1-methylcyclopropene to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should transform existing provisional authorisations into full authorisations, amend them or withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '15.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 44/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/19/EC\nof 14 February 2006\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include 1-methylcyclopropene as active substance\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 28 February 2002 an application from Rohm and Haas France S.A. for the inclusion of the active substance 1-methylcyclopropene in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COUNCIL OF THE  EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 75/268/EEC of 28 April 1975 on mountain and hill farming and farming in  certain less-favoured areas  (1), and in particular Article 2 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament  (2),
Whereas a significant proportion of the territory of Sweden suffers from permanent natural  handicaps; whereas Declaration No 37 of the 1994 Act of Accession recognizes that the boundaries of  the mountain and other less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Article 3 of Directive  75/268/EEC should be delimited without delay;
Whereas the permanent natural handicaps in these areas result in higher production costs and  prevent farmers from obtaining a reasonable income from their production at a level similar to that  available to comparable farmers in other regions;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 2 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC, the Swedish Government has sent  the Commission a list of communes (kommuner) and, where necessary, parts of communes (foersamlingar)  likely to appear on the Community list of less-favoured farming areas, together with the  information relating to the characteristics of those areas;
Whereas the information available leads to the conclusion that all the areas situated north of the  62nd parallel are affected by very difficult climatic conditions the effect of which is to  substantially shorten the growing season and that they satisfy the conditions set out in Article 3  (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC;
Whereas the abovementioned Declaration No 37 allows Sweden to include, pursuant to Article 3 (3) of  Directive 75/268/EEC, four of the five agricultural support areas existing in the north of Sweden  at the time of accession of that State to the European Union;
Whereas certain adjacent communes may be classified within the meaning of Article 3 (3) in that  they are affected by very difficult climatic conditions the result of which is a substantially  shortened growing season of a maximum of 170 days with an average temperature not lower than 5   °C;
Whereas the steep slopes referred to in the second indent of Article 3 (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC  are defined as greater than 20  %;
Whereas, where there is a combination of the two factors altitude and steep slopes, as referred to  in the third indent of Article 3 (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC, a minimum altitude of 500 metres and  an average slope of at least 15  % are the characteristics selected;
Whereas, in cases involving the presence of infertile land and where the economic results of  farming are appreciably lower than the average, as referred to in Article 3 (4) (a) and (b) of  Directive 75/268/EEC, the areas have been defined using a standard index of yields of the main  annual crops and the gross value added of holdings per annual work unit (GVA/AWU);
Whereas the maximum value of the two average indices referred to above for each area has been fixed  at 80  % of the national average index; whereas, in specific cases, the average index of standard  yields is not taken into account in respect of the less-favoured farming areas where fodder land  within the meaning of Article 4 (g) (3), second indent of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27  June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal  (1), as amended by Regulation  (EEC) No 2066/92  (2), covers more than 70  % of the utilized agricultural area;
Whereas the following indices have been chosen in respect of low and dwindling population as  referred to in Article 3 (4) (c) of Directive 75/268/EEC: density not exceeding 50 inhabitants per  km2 without reference to the national average which is only 21 inhabitants per km2, or an annual  depopulation rate exceeding 0,5  %, with the working population engaged in farming forming a  significant proportion of the total working population of the commune;
Whereas, for the definition of the areas affected by specific handicaps which may be included among  the less-favoured areas referred to in Article 3 (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC the criterion selected  is the existence of unfavourable natural conditions (the two indices below the national average)  and of specific permanent handicaps characteristic of:
-  a hilly area with fragmented agricultural holdings,
-  a humid and marshy area,
-  an area regularly subject to flooding or affected by a poor surface and ground water balance,
-  coastal or lake island areas;
Whereas the total surface area of the areas referred to in Article 3 (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC  does not exceed 4  % of the total surface area of the Member State;
Whereas the nature and level of the above indices selected by the Swedish Government for  identifying the types of area notified to the Commission are in conformity with the characteristics  of mountain areas, less-favoured areas and areas affected by specific handicaps respectively, as  referred to in Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) respectively of Directive 75/268/EEC;
Whereas Sweden has a large number of islands; whereas the list of smaller islands classified in  accordance with Article 3 (5) may be supplemented at a future date and may be the subject of a  Commission decision pursuant to Article 2 (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC,","{'title': 'Council Directive 95/498/EC of 23 November 1995 concerning the Community list of less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Directive 75/268/EEC (Sweden)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe less-favoured areas of Sweden shall be those listed in Annexes I,  II and III to this Directive and shall be included in the Community list of less-favoured farming  areas within the meaning of Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Directive is addressed to the Kingdom of Sweden.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 November 1995.\n\nFor the Council The President C.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 113 and 100a in conjunction with Article 228(2), first sentence and Article 228(3) first subparagraph thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the Council's Decision of June 1996 laying down negotiating directives and authorising the Commission to negotiate an agreement on humane trapping standards with Canada, the Russian Federation, the United States and any other interested country,
Having regard to the Council's Decision of 22 July 1997 approving the Agreement on international humane trapping standards between the European Community, Canada and the Russian Federation and calling upon the Commission to intensify its efforts to reach an agreement with the United States of America that is equivalent to the Agreement with Canada and the Russian Federation,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 (3), and in particular the second indent of Article 3(1) thereof, refers to internationally agreed humane trapping standards with which trapping methods used by third countries that have not prohibited leghold traps must conform in order for those countries to be able to export pelts and products manufactured from certain species to the Community;
Whereas the Agreement's main purpose is to lay down harmonised technical standards offering a sufficient level of protection to the welfare of trapped animals and governing both the production and use of traps, and to facilitate trade between the Parties in traps, pelts and products manufactured from species covered by the Agreement;
Whereas implementation of the Agreement requires the establishment of a timetable of testing and certifying the conformity of traps with the standards laid down and for the replacement of uncertified traps;
Whereas the Agreement in the form of an Agreed Minute attached to this Decision is consistent with the negotiating directives referred to above; whereas it therefore satisfies the concept of internationally agreed humane trapping standards referred to in the second indent of Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
I. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 21,9 % on imports of VHS video tape in cassettes (hereinafter 'video cassettes') falling within CN code ex 8523 13 00 originating in Hong Kong, with the  exception of imports from several exporters specifically mentioned which were subject to a lesser rate of duty or exempt from duty.
(2) In recital 43 of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89, concerning companies which started, or will start, exporting own-produced video cassettes to the Community after the end of the investigation period (newcomers), the Council noted that the Commission was  ready to initiate without delay a review proceeding if the exporting company could show the Commission, and supply sufficient evidence, that it did not export the products concerned to the Community during the period of investigation. The company also  has to demonstrate that it started or will start, those exports after the said period and that it is not related to, or associated with, any of the companies subject to the investigation.
II. REVIEW
(3) By a notice published on 8 April 1992 (3), the Commission, after consultation with the Advisory Committee and in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, initiated a review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 as it concerned a Hong Kong  company, Inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd. This company had submitted that it did not export the products subject to the anti-dumping duty during the previous period of investigation (1 January - 30 November 1987) but that it started such exports after  the said period. In addition, it submitted that it was not related with any of the companies subject to the previous investigation for which dumping was found. Accordingly, the Commission commenced an investigation in order to verify where  Inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd could be considered as a newcomer and to establish a dumping margin, if any, for this company.
III. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. Newcomer
(4) The investigation showed that Inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd began to export own-produced video cassettes to the Community after the previous investigation period mentioned in recital 3. In addition, it was found that this company had no link of any  sort with the exporters involved in the previous procedure and for which dumping was found. The Council confirms that it should accordingly be considered as a newcomer and that a partial review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 as it concerned  Inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd was warranted.
2. Normal value
(5) As Inter-Casstte (Hong Kong) Ltd did sell video cassettes on the domestic market in sufficient quantities during the investigation period for this review, and at prices which permitted recovery of all costs, normal value was determined on the basis  of the weighted average domestic prices for the models exported to the Community.
3. Export price
(6) Export prices were determined by the Commission on the basis of the prices, net of all rebates, actually paid or payable for the video cassettes sold for export by Inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd to the Community. Indeed, since exports were made  directly to independent importers in the Community, these export prices were found to be reliable.
The Council confirms this finding.
4. Comparison
(7) For the purpose of a fair comparison between normal value and export price, the Commission took account of differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2 (9) and (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. All comparisons were made  at ex-works level, at the same level of trade and, for the export price, on a transaction by transaction basis.
The examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which normal value exceeds the price for export to the Community and, as expressed as a percentage of total cif value, was 1,4 %.
The Council confirms the above findings.
5. Measures
(8) A dumping margin of 1,4 % was considered as being de minimis in the original Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 for imports of video tape on reels originating in the Republic of Korea. The Commission sees no reason to depart from this appreciation  in the present proceeding and the Council confirms this appreciation. Therefore, the adoption of protective measures against imports of video tape in cassettes manufactured by inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd and originating in Hong Kong is not justified.
IV. AMENDMENT OF THE REVIEWED MEASURES
(9) Accordingly, the Commission considers that Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 should be amended and that inter-Cassette (Hong Kong) Ltd be exempted from the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on VHS videotapes in cassettes originating in Hong Kong.
(10) The complainants were informed of the considerations and main facts on the basis of which the Council intended to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 and had no suibstantial comments to make.
(11) Since this review is limited to one Hong Kong producer, it does not affect the date on which Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 in regard to Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 will expire,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3498/92 of 30 November 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 in respect of definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of video cassettes originating in Hong Kong', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe following subparagraph shall be added to Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89:\n\n'The duty specified in paragraph 2 (b) shall not apply to models of video tape in cassettes manufactured by inter-Cassette (Hong-Kong) Ltd and originating in Hong Kong (additional taric Code: 8292).'""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 1528/2004
of 26 August 2004
fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '27.8.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 278/49', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 1528/2004\nof 26 August 2004\nfixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other.

Whereas:
(1) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3533/93(4), lays down the rules applying to the time limit for producing supporting evidence for the payment of aid, but does not make provision for cases where no supporting evidence is presented. The appropriate provisions should therefore be adopted.
(2) Article 9(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3444/90 provides for the possibility of curtailing the storage period in the case of exports of products under contract, regardless of whether they qualify for an export refund or not. Where the products qualify for a refund, proof of export is offered using the documents laid down in Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(6). With a view to simplifying the monitoring operations, a similar procedure should be introduced for the proof to be offered when products are exported without a refund.
(3) In order to ensure the proper operation of the private storage aid introduced pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2179/2002 of 6 December 2002 on special conditions for the granting of private storage aid for pigmeat(7), the proposed amendments should apply immediately to the contracts concluded under that Regulation.

It does not contain any imprints, ornaments, symbols or inscriptions and accordingly is not to be used for a specific festivity (see also the CN Explanatory Notes to heading 9505 ). Moreover, the ‘lei’ serves to decorate a person and not a room, table etc. It is neither a part of a fancy dress that is used for carnival (see also the HS Explanatory Notes to heading 9505 , (A) (1) and (3)).\nClassification under heading 6307  as other made-up textile article is also excluded, because heading 6702  (articles made of artificial flowers) is the heading providing the more specific description within the meaning of General Rule 3(a) for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature.\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 6702\xa090\xa000  as ‘article made of artificial flowers, of other materials than plastics’.\n662\n(\n*1\n)\nThe photograph is purely for information.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes powdered corn cob.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, powdered corn cob has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 14, rodenticides, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) Greece was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 22 October 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission with the involvement of the applicant. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 21 September 2012, in an assessment report.
(5) The assessment report concludes that biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing powdered corn cob may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC, and therefore recommends the inclusion of powdered corn cob for use in product type 14 in Annex I to that Directive. It is appropriate to follow that recommendation.
(6) The assessment report also concludes that biocidal products used as rodenticides and containing powdered corn cob may be expected to present only low risk to humans, non-target animals and the environment, in particular with regard to the use which was examined and detailed in the assessment report, that is, when used in the form of pellets in dry locations. The report therefore recommends the inclusion of powdered corn cob for that use in Annex IA to Directive 98/8/EC. It is appropriate to follow that recommendation.
(7) In accordance with current practice, and in compliance with Article 10(1) of Directive 98/8/EC, it is appropriate to limit the duration of the inclusion to 10 years.
(8) Not all potential uses and exposure scenarios have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate to require that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to human populations and to environmental compartments that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(9) The provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive should be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment on the Union market of biocidal products of product-type 14 containing the active substance powdered corn cob and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I and Annex IA to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of 28 September 2011 of Member States and the Commission on explanatory documents (3), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.
(14) The Committee established by Article 28(1) of Directive 98/8/EC has not delivered an opinion on the measures provided for in this Directive, and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to the measures and forwarded it to the European Parliament. The Council did not act within the two-month period provided for by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4), and the Commission therefore submitted the proposal to the European Parliament without delay.

By virtue of rule 3(b) it is to be classified as if it consisted of the component which gives the equipment its essential character.\nGiven the equipment’s objective characteristics, namely the preponderance of components with the heartbeat measuring and monitoring function, the essential character of the equipment is given by the measuring components. The clock function of the equipment is ancillary to its function as a measuring apparatus since an apparatus for performing measurements based on time (heartbeats per minute) relies on a clock for establishing the time comparison when processing the measurement. Consequently, classification under heading 9102  as a watch is excluded.\nClassification under heading 9018  as a medical instrument or appliance is also excluded as the apparatus is generally not used in medical professional practice (see also the first paragraph of the Harmonised System Explanatory Notes (HSEN) to heading 9018 ).\nPerforming a measurement in relation to a time factor (determination of the heart rhythm or heartbeats per minute) is not counting a total number of units of any kind (see also the HSEN to heading 9029 , point (A)). Consequently, classification under subheading 9029\xa010\xa000  as revolution counters, production counters, taximeters, milometers, pedometers and the like is excluded.\nThe determination of the heart rhythm (heartbeats per minute) is not the determination of the speed of revolution or the linear speed (see also the HSEN to heading 9029 , point (B)). Consequently, classification under subheading 9029\xa020  as speed indicators and tachometers is also excluded.\nThe equipment is therefore to be classified under CN code 9031\xa080\xa038  as other electronic measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines not specified or included elsewhere in Chapter 90.\n2.\nA heartbeat sensor and a wireless transmitter, incorporated in a chest strap intended to be worn round the chest for sensing heartbeats.\nThe product senses heartbeats and transmits the correspondent data wirelessly to a heart rhythm monitoring device which is not included upon presentation.\n(\n*1\n)\nSee image 2\n9031\xa090\xa085\nClassification is determined by general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, note 2(b) to Chapter 90 and by the wording of CN codes 9031 , 9031\xa090  and 9031\xa090\xa085 .\nThe product is suitable for use solely or principally with a heartbeat measuring equipment of heading 9031 . It is an essential component for the functioning of heartbeat measuring equipment as the latter cannot work without it.\nThe product is therefore to be classified under CN code 9031\xa090\xa085  as other parts of measuring or checking instruments, appliances and machines not specified or included elsewhere in Chapter 90.\n(\n*1\n)\nThe images are purely for information.'}]}"

Whereas, pursuant to Article 24 of Directive 80/836/Euratom, all Member States must ensure that exposed workers received adequate information on radiation protection;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 45 (4) of the said Directive, each Member State must, in the event of an accident, stipulate the intervention levels and measures to be taken by the competent authorities and the necessary resources both in personnel and equipment to enable action to be taken to safeguard and maintain the health of the general public;
Whereas, at Community level, further elements should be added to the information made available to the public over and above the areas already covered by Article 6 (2) of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (6) and by Article 8 (1) of Council Directive 82/501 /EEC of 24 June 1982 on the major accident hazards of certain industrial activities (7), as amended by Directive 88/610/EEC (8);
Whereas all Member States have signed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident;
Whereas Council Decision 87/600/Euratom of 14 December 1987 on Community arranements for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency (9) requires all Member States which decide to take mergency measures to protect the general public, either as a result of abnormally high levels of radioactivity in the environment, or following an accident from which a significant release of radioactive material occurs or is likely to occur, to notify the Commission and the Member States which are, or are likely to be, affected, of the protective measures which they have taken or planned and also of any measures which they have taken or planned and also of any measures which they have taken or planned to inform the general public;
Whereas some Member States have already concluded bilateral agreements on information, coordination and mutual assistance in the event a nuclear accident;
Whereas, in the event of an accident in a nuclear installation in a Member State, the population affected should be encouraged to take appropriate action likely to increase the effectiveness of the emergency measures taken or planned;
Whereas the sections of the population likely to be affected by the radiological emergency should therefore be given in advance appropriate and continuing information on the planned health protection measures relating to them and the action they should take in the event of a radiological emergency; whereas certain joint principles and specific provisions for informing such sections of the population should be drawn up for this purpose at Community level;
Whereas joint principles and specific provisions for informing the population actually affected by a real radiological emergency should also be drawn up;
Whereas account must also be taken, in the information supplied, of those sections of the population living in frontier areas;

(2) The definition of eggs set out in point 5.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (5) does not include cooked eggs while the definition of egg products set out in point 7.3 of Annex I to that Regulation covers cooked eggs. Therefore, the appropriate Harmonised System (HS) code of the World Customs Organisation for cooked eggs, namely 04.07, should also be referred to in the model veterinary certificate for egg products set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.
(3) Where egg products covered by HS code 04.07 originating from an area under animal health restrictions are imported into the Union, it is necessary that those products have been subjected to an appropriate treatment for the inactivation of disease agents. For that purpose, certain treatments for egg products recommended in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as standards for international trade should be taken into account and be included in the Animal health attestation in Part II of the model veterinary certificate for egg products.
(4) The model veterinary certificate for egg products set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 lays down rules for the control of Salmonella in different poultry populations in the Union. It provides that admission to or retention on the lists of third countries provided for in Union legislation, for the relevant species or category, from which Member States are authorised to import those animals or hatching eggs covered by that Regulation is subject to the submission to the Commission by the third country concerned of a control programme for Salmonella with equivalent guarantees to those contained in the national control programmes for Salmonella in the Member States.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2008 of 18 December 2008 concerning the approval of control programmes for Salmonella in certain third countries in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and listing of avian influenza surveillance programmes in certain third countries and amending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 (6) approves the control programmes submitted by Croatia on 11 March 2008 as regards Salmonella in breeding poultry of Gallus gallus, hatching eggs thereof, laying hens of Gallus gallus, table eggs thereof and day-old chicks of Gallus gallus intended for breeding or laying.
(7) The control programmes submitted by Croatia on 11 March 2008 also provides the guarantees required by Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 for Salmonella control in all other flocks of Gallus gallus. These programmes should therefore also be approved. Regulation (EC) No 1291/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The entry for Croatia in the list in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should be amended to take account of the approval of the control programmes for Salmonella for all flocks of Gallus gallus.
(9) Commission Decision 2007/843/EC of 11 December 2007 concerning approval of Salmonella control programmes in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus in certain third countries in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Decision 2006/696/EC, as regards certain public health requirements at import of poultry and hatching eggs (7) approves the control programme submitted by Tunisia for Salmonella in flocks of breeding hens, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003. In that Decision, as amended by Commission Decision 2011/238/EU (8), the programme submitted by Tunisia has been deleted since that third country has stopped the programme. The entry for Tunisia in the list in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should be amended to take account of that deletion.
(10) Regulations (EC) No 798/2008 and (EC) No 1291/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) Commission Regulation (EU) No 925/2010 of 15 October 2010 amending Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as regards transit through the Union of poultry meat and poultry meat products from Russia (9) contains an obvious error in the entry for Israel (IL-2), in column 7 of the table set out in Annex II to that Regulation, which should be corrected. The corrected Regulation should be applicable as of the date of entry into force of that Regulation.
(12) Commission Regulation (EU) No 955/2010 of 22 October 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as regards the use of vaccines against Newcastle disease (10) contains an error in the veterinary model certificate for meat of poultry (POU) set out in the Annex to that Regulation. The error concerns the entry ‘Treatment type’, which was erroneously, introduced in Part I (Details of dispatched consignment) in box I.28 of that certificate. The entry ‘Treatment type’ is not applicable for meat of poultry and should therefore be deleted from the model certificate. That error should be corrected.
(13) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit Member States and the industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification requirements following the correction to Regulation (EU) No 955/2010.
(14) Regulations (EU) No 925/2010 and (EU) No 955/2010 should therefore be corrected accordingly.

Assembly of a multidisciplinary team\n\nThis team, which involves all parts of the enterprise concerned with the product, needs to include the whole range of specific knowledge and expertise appropriate to the product under consideration, its production (manufacture, storage, and  distribution), its consumption and the associated potential hazards.\n\nWhere necessary, the team will be assisted by specialists who will help it to solve its difficulties as regards assessment and control of critical points.\n\nThe team may consist of:\n\n- a quality control specialist who understands the biological, chemical or physical hazards connected with a particular product group,\n\n- a production specialist who has responsibility for, or is closely involved with, the technical process of manufacturing the product under study,\n\n- a technician who has a working knowledge of the hygiene and operation of the process plant and equipment,\n\n- any other person with specialist knowledge of microbiology, hygiene and food technology.\n\nOne person may fulfil several of these roles, provided all relevant information is available to the team and is used to ensure that the own-checks system developed is reliable. Where expertise is not available in the establishment, advice should be  obtained from other sources (consultancy, guides of good manufacturing practices, etc.).\n\n2. Description of the product\n\nThe end product should be described in terms of:\n\n- composition (e.g. raw materials, ingredients, additives, etc.),\n\n- structure and physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. solid, liquid, gel, emulsion, Aw, Ph, etc.),\n\n- processing (e.g. heating, freezing, drying, salting, smoking, etc. and to what extent),\n\n- packaging (e.g. hermetic, vacuum, modified atmosphere),\n\n- storage and distribution conditions,\n\n- required shelf life (e.g. sell by date and best before date),\n\n- instructions for use,\n\n- any microbiological or chemical criteria applicable.\n\n3. Identification of intended use\n\nThe multidisciplinary team should also define the normal or expected use of the product by the customer and the consumer target groups for which the product is intended. In specific cases, the suitability of the product for particular groups of  consumers, such as institutional caterers, travellers, etc. and for vulnerable groups of the population may have to be considered.\n\n4. Construction of a flow diagram (Description of manufacturing process)\n\nWhatever the format chosen all steps involved in the process, including delays during or between steps, from receiving the raw materials to placing the end product on the market, through preparation, processing, packaging, storage and distribution,  should be studied in sequence and presented in a detailed flow diagram with sufficient technical data.\n\nTypes of data may include but are not limited to:\n\n- plan of working premises and ancillary premises,\n\n- equipment layout and characteristics,\n\n- sequence of all process steps (including the incorporation of raw materials, ingredients or additives and delays during or between steps),\n\n- technical parameters of operations (in particular time and temperature, including delays),\n\n- flow of products (including potential cross-contamination),\n\n- segregation of clean and dirty areas (or high/low risk areas),\n\n- cleaning and disinfectrion procedures,\n\n- hygienic environment of the establishment,\n\n- personnel routes and hygiene practices,\n\n- product storage and distribution conditions.\n\n5. On-site confirmation of flow diagram\n\nAfter the flow diagram has been drawn up, the multidisciplinary team should confirm it on site during operating hours. Any observed deviation must result in an amendment of the original flow diagram to make it accurate.\n\n6. Listing of hazards and control measures\n\nUsing the confirmed flow diagram as a guide, the team should:\n\n(a) list all potential biological, chemical or physical hazards that may be reasonably expected to occur at each process step (including acquisition and storage of raw materials and ingredients and delays during manufacture).\n\nA hazard is a potential to cause harm to health and is anything covered by the hygiene objectives of Directive 91/493/EEC. Specifically, it can be any of the following:\n\n- unacceptable contamination (or recontamination) of a biological (micro-organisms, parasites), chemical or physical nature of raw materials, intermediate products or final products,\n\n- unacceptable survival or multiplication of pathogenic micro-organisms and unacceptable generation of chemicals in intermediate products, final products, production line or line environment,\n\n- unacceptable production or persistence of toxins or other undesirable products of microbial metabolism.\n\nFor inclusion in the list, hazards must be of a nature such that their elimination or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the to the production of safe food.\n\n(b) consider and describe what control measures, if any, exist which can be applied for each hazard.\n\nControl measures are those actions and activities that can be used to prevent hazards, eliminate them or reduce their impact or occurrence to acceptable levels.\n\nMore than one control measure may be required to control an identified hazard and more than one hazard may be controlled by one control measure. For instance, pasteurization or controlled heat treatment may provide sufficient assurance of reduction of  the level of both salmonella and listeria.\n\nControl measures need to be supported by detailed procedures and specifications to ensure their effective implementation. For instance, detailed cleaning schedules, precise heat treatment specifications, maximum concentrations of preservatives used in  compliance with the applicable Community rules on additives and in particular Directive 89/107/EEC (1).\n\n7. Methods for identification of criticla points\n\nThe identification of a critical point for the control of a hazard requires a logical approach. Such an approach can be facilitated by the use of the following decision tree (other methods can be used by the team, according to their knowledge and  experience).\n\nDecision tree for the identification of critical points\n\nAnswer each question in sequence, at each step and for each identified hazard.\n\nFor the application of the decision tree, each process step identified in the flow diagram should be considered in sequence. At each step, the decision tree must be applied to each hazard that may be reasonably expected to occur or be introduced and  each control measure identified.\n\nApplication of the decision tree should be flexible and requires common sense, having consideration for the whole manufacturing process in order to avoid, whenever possible, unnecessary critical points.\n\n8. Action to be taken following identification of a critical point\n\nThe identification of critical points has two consequences for the multidisciplinary team which should then:\n\n- ensure that appropriate control measures are effectively designed and implemented. In particular, if a hazard has been identified at a step where control is necessary for product safety and no control measure exists at that step,or at any other, then  the product or process should be modified at that step, or at any other, then the product or process should be modified at that step, or at an earlier or later stage, to include a control measure,\n\n- establish and implement a monitoring and checking system at each critical point.\n\nCHAPTER II:   ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF MONITORING AND CHECKING CRITICAL POINTS  An appropriate monitoring and checking system is essential to ensure the effective control of each critical point.\n\nTo develop such a system, it is recommended to proceed to the following activities:\n\n1. Establishment of critical limits for each control measure associated with each critical point\n\nEach control measure associated with a critical point should give rise to the specification of critical limits.\n\nThose critical limits correspond to the extreme values acceptable with regard to product safety. They separate acceptability from unacceptability. They are set for observable or measurable parameters which can readily demonstrate that the critical point  is under control; they should be based on substantiated evidence that chosen values will result in process control.\n\nExamples of such parameters include temperature, time, pH, moisture level, additive, preservative or salt level, sensory parameters such as visual appearance or texture, ect.\n\nIn some cases, to reduce the risk of exceeding a critical limit due to process variations, it may be necessary to specify more stringent levels (i.e. target levels) to assure that critical limits are observed.\n\nCritical limits may be derived from a variety of sources. When not taken from regulatory standards (e.g. frozen storage temperature) or from existing and validated guides of good manufactoring practices, the team should ascertain their validity relative  to the control of identified hazard and critical points.\n\n2. Establishment of a monitoring and checking system for each critical point\n\nAn essential part of own-checks is a programme of observations or measurements performed at each critical point to ensure compliance with specified critical limits. The programme should describe the methods, the frequency of observations or measurements  and the recording procedure.\n\nObservations or measurements must be able to detect loss of control at critical points and provide information in time for corrective action to be taken.\n\nObservations or measurements can be made continuously or discontinuously. When observations or measurements are not continuous, it is necessary to establish a frequency of observations or measurements which provides reliable information.\n\nThe programme of observations or measurements should properly identify for each critical point:\n\n- who is to perform monitoring and checking,\n\n- when monitoring and checking is performed,\n\n- how monitoring and checking is performed.\n\n3. Establishment of a corrective action plan\n\nObservations or measurements may indicate:\n\n- that the parameter monitored tends to deviate from its specified critical limits, indicating a trend toward loss of control. Appropriate corrective action to maintain control must be taken before the occurence of hazard,\n\n- that the parameter monitored has deviated from its specified critical limits, indicating a loss of control. It is necessary to take appropriate corrective action to regain control.\n\nCorrective action has to be planned in advance by the multidisciplinary team, for each critical point, so that it can be taken without hesitation when a deviation is observed.\n\nSuch corrective action should include:\n\n- proper identification of the person(s) responsible for the implementation of the corrective action,\n\n- description of means and action required to correct the observed deviation,\n\n- action to be taken with regard to products that have been manufactured during the period when the process was out of control,\n\n- written record of measures taken.\n\nCHAPTER III:   VERIFICATION OF OWN-CHECKS SYSTEMS  Own-checks system verification is necessary to ensure that they are working effectively. The multidisciplinary team should specify the methods and procedures to be used.\n\nUsable methods may include in particular random sampling and analysis, reinforced analysis or tests at selected critical points, intensified analysis of intermediate or final products, surveys on actual condition during storage, distribution and sale  and on actual use of the product.\n\nVerification procedures may include: inspection of operations, validation of critical limits, review of deviations, corrective action and measures taken with regard to the product, audits of the own-check system and its records.\n\nVerification should provide for confirmation of the suitability of the own-checks system established and ensure, afterwards, with an appropriate frequency, that the provisions laid down are still being properly applied.\n\nIn addition, it is necessary to review the system, to ensure that it is (or will be) still valid in case of change.\n\nExamples of change include:\n\n- change in raw material or in product, processing conditions (factory layout and environment, process equipment, cleaning and disinfection programme),\n\n- change in packaging, storage or distribution conditions,\n\n- change in consumer use,\n\n- receipt of any information on a new hazard associated with the product.\n\nWhere necessary, such a review must result in the amendment of the provisions laid down.\n\nAny change to the own-checks system arising should be fully incorporated into the documentation and record-keeping system in order to ensure that accurate up-to-date information is available.\n\nWhere criteria are specified in regulations, such criteria are to be used as reference values for the verification process.\n\n(1) OJ No L 40, 11. 2. 1989, p. 27.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic  Community,Having regard to Council Regulation N° 17 of 6 February 1962, first Regulation  implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of  Greece, and in particular Article 2 thereof,Having regard to the notification and application for  negative clearance submitted on 29 June 1973 and on
20 May 1985 by the Coffee Terminal Market  Association
of London concerning the Rules and Regulations of
the Association,Having regard to the  summary of the notification published (2) pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation
N° 17,After  consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,I. FACTSThe  Coffee Terminal Market Association of London (CTMAL) is one of many commodity markets established  in London. The commodity markets are self-regulatory organizations run by Committees of Management  selected by members from amongst themselves, aided by secretariats, and using powers given to them  by their members in market rule books. Although the markets are self-regulating, there is an  element of supervision by the Bank of England.The object of the CTMAL is to set up and to  administer a terminal market in London for coffee. A terminal market or a futures market provides  organized facilities for concluding contracts for the purchase and sale of a commodity to be  delivered at named future dates. Futures markets have been developed primarily to enable persons  involved in commodity trading to protect themselves from the risks of adverse price movements.The  CTMAL provides a market floor for trading and price-making, determines various technical questions  such as allowable delivery months and the standard contract terms
and procures the provision of  clearing and settlement facilities. Trading is done on the floor of the market where dealers face  each other with bids and offers being made by the system known as 'open outcry'.The contract  currently traded on the Coffee Market is for
5 tonnes, or a multiple of 5 tonnes, of Sound Robusta  CTMAL Standard (i.e. a quality defined in detail in Section 5 of the Rules of the CTMAL) and stored  in a warehouse nominated by the CTMAL.All contracts traded on the London Coffee Terminal Market  must be registered with International Commodities Clearing House Limited ('ICCH'), an independent  service company which provides clearing and settlement facilities for the CTMAL. ICCH has  substantial capital and reserves and is wholly owned by six clearing banks. The principal functions  of ICCH are to maintain and organize a 'daily clearing' of all trades and provide a guarantee for  due fulfilment of contracts, in accordance with the rules of the CTMAL, to clearing members in  whose names such contracts are registered.The number of Floor Members of the CTMAL, the only  category of members permitted to trade on the floor of the market, is limited to 35, although this  number may be increased by the Association in General Meeting. There are two other classes of  membership: Home Associate Members and Overseas Associate Members. Their number is unlimited.  Associate Members do not have the right to attend or vote at general meetings of the  CTMAL.Applicants for membership may be of any nationality but must satisfy certain minimum capital  requirements laid down from time to time by the Committee of Management. They must furthermore be  carrying on business in the coffee trade and must have done so prior to membership for a period of  time also to be laid down from time to time by the Committee. Applicants for floor membership must  trade from an office in London established for that purpose. A detailed statement of the criteria  for membership in force at any time may be obtained from the Association upon application.  Membership may be transferred to another firm or company provided that other also meets the  criteria for membership.All Floor Members must be members ('clearing members') of the ICCH and must  register their contracts with the ICCH which in return for its fee guarantees the performance of  the contracts.
An appeal procedure applies if the Committee of Management refuses an application for membership,  refuses to grant permission for a transfer of a member's membership or refuses a change in the  control or nature of the member's firm or company. The procedure also applies if a member is  expelled or suspended and the member is dissatisfied with the Committee's decision. The candidate  or member can ask the Committee to reconsider its decision, making such representations and  supplying such information as it considers relevant.Business concluded on the floor of the market  between Floor Members may be transacted free of commission. Commission must be charged on all other  transactions between members or between members and non-members but rates of commission are freely  negotiable. The exemption from the obligation for Floor Members to charge 'a' commission is  explained by their ownership of the Markets. This causes a variety of extra costs that the other  categories of members do not bear because they have no ownership in the Market. Provision is made  for an additional commission (equal to the original commission charged on the sale) where coffee is  tendered in fulfilment of a contract by a deliverer who is not a clearing member of ICCH in whose  name the contract is registered). This extra commission is paid to the clearing member in whose  name the contract is registered with ICCH. In the case of contracts open and closed on the same  day, no commission is charged on the closing transaction.For administrative purposes and on behalf  of its members, ICCH may collect a sum on account of any commission payable on any contract  registrable with it. For this purpose, ICCH may, from time to time, notify its members of the rates  of commission to be applied by ICCH to contracts which are registrable with it.The international  futures markets in London are the principal markets used in international commodity merchandising  and they contribute to the stability and smooth operation of world trade and to world pricing  mechanisms. They are also very large. As for coffee, the figures below show the relative size of  the CTMAL, compared with its two most important competitors, i.e. the futures markets for coffee in  Paris and New York.Annual volumes of trade (lots traded)

II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT1.The notified Rules and Regulations of the CTMAL are to be  considered as agreements within the meaning of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty.2.The Rules and  Regulations as originally notified specified the minimum net rates of commission which could be  charged by a member. The Committee had powers to suspend or expel offending members. The minimum  commission rates varied according to who was paying and who was receiving the commission and  whether or not the contract was registered in the client's own name (as opposed to non-clearing  clients). The rates were cheaper if the contract was registered in the client's own name with ICCH,  and where a Home Associate Member or Overseas Associate was the payer rather than a non-member. The  rates were still lower if a Floor Member was the payer.
Floor Members have the right to deal free of commission but when dealing for House Associate or  Overseas Associate Members or for non-members, they had in the past to charge the minimum rates of  commission specified. A Floor Member unable at any time to operate on the floor himself, had to  place any business he wished to transact through another Floor Member and pay the appropriate  minimum rate of Commission laid down in the Regulations. Home Associate and Overseas Associate  Members could only deal with each other at or above the stipulated minimum rate of commission. The  Commission considered the above described system of specified minimum commission rates as a form of  price-fixing that violates Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty. The CTMAL was requested to abandon the  system of fixed minimum rates. The system has now been abolished as such. References to the system  in the Rules and Regulations have been deleted. The rules now provide that business concluded on  the floor of the market between Floor Members may be transacted free of commission. Commission must  be charged on all other transactions between members or between members and non-members. The  Commission believes that this obligation is not appreciably restrictive of competition because it  only entails the obligation to charge 'a' commission without any reference to the rate. It follows  that complete freedom exists to negotiate the actual commission rates.3.Furthermore, as a result of  the representations by the Commission, other amendments were also made to the rules concerning  membership so that it is now made clear on the face of the Articles that membership is open and the  criteria by which applications for membership are judged are objective (see Facts, seventh  paragraph, above). The Committee of Management is now required to give reasons when it takes  decisions affecting the members' rights of membership. To protect the rights of actual or
potential  members an appeal procedure has been introduced. As an ultimate resort an appellant would have  recourse to the ordinary courts under English law.
4.The publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities pursuant to Article 19 (3) of  Regulation N° 17 did not bring in any representations.5.The notified Articles of Association and  Rules and Regulations, in their amended form, no longer contain any clauses which constitute  appreciable restrictions on competition within the common market. Therefore, the Commission, on the  basis of the facts in its possession, has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1), Consequently,  the Commission is able to issue a negative clearance pursuant to
Article 2 of Regulation 17.","{'title': '85/565/EEC: Commission Decision of 13 December 1985 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/27.592 - Coffee Terminal Market Association of London Limited) (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 of Regulation 17.', 'text': 'Article 2 of Regulation 17.\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nOn the basis of the facts in its possession the  Commission has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the Rules  and Regulations of the Coffee Terminal Association of London as last notified on 20 May  1985.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to The Coffee Terminal Market Association of London  Limited whose registered office is at Cereal House, 58 Mark Lane, London EC3, United  Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 December 1985.For the Commission\n\nPeter  SUTHERLAND\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ N° 13, 21. 2. 1962, p. 204/62.\n\n(2) OJ N° C 204, 13. 8. 1985, p. 8.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic anti-dumping Regulation), and in particular Articles 11(4) and 13(4) thereof, and to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (2) (the basic anti-subsidy Regulation) and in particular Articles 20, 23(5) and (6) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) The Council, by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 (3) and (EC) No 2597/1999 (4) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing measures respectively on PET film originating in India (the original measures). By Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 (5) and (EC) No 1976/2004 (6), the Council extended these measures to PET film consigned from Israel (the extended measures) with the exception of imports produced by one company specifically mentioned.
(2) By Regulation (EC) No 101/2006 (7) the Council amended Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 in order to exempt one other company from the extended measures.
(3) Following an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 (8) imposed an antidumping duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and extended the duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not, with the exception of certain producers specified in Articles 2(4) of that Regulation.
(4) Following an expiry review of the countervailing measures, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (9) imposed a countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and extended the duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not, with the exception of certain producers specified in Article 1(3) of that Regulation.
(5) Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 were last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 15/2009 (10).
B.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(6) The Commission has received a request for an exemption pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20, 23(5) and (6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation from the anti-dumping and countervailing measures extended to imports of PET film consigned from Israel. The application was lodged by S.Z.P. Plastic Packaging Products Ltd (the applicant) a producer in Israel (the country concerned).
C.   PRODUCT
(7) The product under examination is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Israel (the product concerned) currently falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90.
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(8) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the European Union under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 or ex 3920 62 90 during the investigation period used in the investigation that led to the extended measures, i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003.
(9) Furthermore, the applicant alleges that it is not related to exporting producers subject to measures and that it has not circumvented the measures applicable to PET film of Indian origin.
E.   PROCEDURE
(10) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.
(11) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20, 23(5) and (6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting the applicant an exemption from the extended measures.
(a)   Questionnaires
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
F.   REPEAL OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(12) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the European Union by the applicant.
(13) At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the examination result in a finding of circumvention in respect of the applicant, the anti-dumping duty can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this examination. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(14) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
(a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 11(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation; and
(b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(15) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(16) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 28 of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(17) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (11).
J.   HEARING OFFICER
(18) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission’s services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 19 November 2004
accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of silicon carbide originating, inter alia, in Ukraine
(2004/782/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8, 21 and 22 (c) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1100/2000 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon carbide originating, inter alia, in Ukraine (‘the existing measures’).
(2) In March 2004, the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3) the initiation of a partial interim review of the existing measures on imports of the product concerned originating, inter alia, in Ukraine to examine whether they should be amended to take account of certain consequences of the enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States (‘enlargement’).
(3) The Council concluded that it was in the interest of the Community to provide for the temporary adaptation of the existing measures so as to avoid a sudden and excessively negative impact on importers and users in the 10 new Member States acceding to the European Union (‘the EU-10’) immediately following enlargement. It was considered that the best means of achieving this was through the acceptance of an undertaking offered by the co-operating party with an element for a quantitative ceiling.
(4) Accordingly, by Decision 2004/498/EC (4), the Commission accepted as a special measure a short-term undertaking from an exporting producer in Ukraine (Open Joint Stock Company Zaporozhsky Abrasivny Combinat).
(5) In order to provide for an exemption from the anti-dumping duties afforded by the acceptance of the undertaking, Regulation (EC) No 1100/2000 was amended by Regulation (EC) No 991/2004.
(6) It was stipulated in Decision 2004/498/EC that the acceptance of the undertaking would be limited to an initial period of six months (‘the original period’) without prejudice to the normal duration of the existing measures and that it would lapse after this period unless the Commission considered it appropriate to extend its period of application.
(7) Accordingly, the Commission has examined whether the exceptional and negative conditions for interested parties in the EU-10 which led to acceptance of the undertaking still exist. As part of the overall appraisal, an evaluation of the compliance of the company concerned with its undertaking was also made.
B.   APPRAISAL
1.   Content of the current undertaking
(8) The existing undertaking offered by the company concerned obliges it, inter alia, to export in accordance with its traditional pattern of trade to customers in the EU-10 within the framework of a quantitative ceiling established on the basis of previous, traditional export flows to the EU-10.
(9) The terms of the undertaking also oblige the signatory company to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a monthly report of its sales to the EU-10 (or re-sales by any related parties in the Community) and to accept verification visits by the Commission. In order, also, to be able to fully monitor the effectiveness of the undertakings, written agreement was received from the exporter’s traditional customers in the EU-10 that they too would allow on-spot verification visits at their premises.
2.   Compliance with the current undertaking
(10) Verification visits to the exporting producer and certain of its traditional customers in the EU-10 confirmed that the company concerned had not exceeded the level of the quantitative ceiling stipulated in the undertaking. In addition, it was found that the company was broadly respecting its traditional pattern of trade with individual customers in the EU-10. Moreover, according to the information available, there have been no apparent ‘spill-overs’ from the EU-10 into the EU-15 of imports of the product concerned which had benefited from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties afforded by the undertaking.
3.   Analysis of conditions for continued acceptance of undertakings
(11) Analysis of the monthly reports submitted to the Commission by the company concerned backed up by available official statistical data showed that a marked difference still existed between the prices for the product concerned in the EU-10 and the EU-15. In addition, it was noted that import volumes from Ukraine into the EU-10 had declined since enlargement, however, as indicated in recital (30) of Regulation (EC) No 991/2004, abnormal increases were found in import volumes prior to enlargement in 2003 and the first months of 2004. It is considered that this might have also contributed to the decrease in quantities imported into the EU-10 following enlargement.
C.   CONCLUSION
1.   Acceptance of an undertaking
(12) Given that the exceptional and negative conditions which prevailed prior to enlargement and which necessitated the undertaking still exist, and that the terms of the undertaking have been observed during the initial period of its application by the company concerned, it is considered that the acceptance of an undertaking offered by the company concerned for a further period is justified.
(13) As concerns the length of this further period, it is considered that a period of application of more than six months would negate the notion of the undertaking being of a transitional nature, therefore, acceptance will only be from 21 November 2004 to 20 May 2005 (‘the final period’).
(14) With regard to the level of the quantitative ceiling to be applied for the final period, this has been calculated following the same methodology as was used to establish the quantitative ceiling for the original period.
(15) In conformity with Regulation (EC) No 991/2004, the undertaking obliges the exporting producer to respect the import ceilings and in order that the undertakings can be monitored, the exporting producer concerned has also agreed to broadly respect its traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU-10. The exporting producer is also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly, or that the undertaking become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor, the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place, or it may adjust the level of the ceiling, or it may take other remedial action.
(16) It is also a condition of the undertaking that if it is breached in any way, the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place.
(17) The company will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, meaning that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission.
(18) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the company’s compliance with the undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 991/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
2.   Disclosure to interested parties
(19) All interested parties which had previously made themselves known were advised of the intention to accept an undertaking. The Community Industry raised certain concerns that a possible ‘spill-over’ of Ukrainian silicon carbide into the EU-15 had occurred, however, during a verification visit by the Commission, it was established that the silicon carbide in question was not of Ukrainian origin. The Community Industry nevertheless expressed the view that an undertaking should not be accepted.
(20) Whilst the position of the Community Industry regarding the acceptance of an undertaking is noted, the circumstances and needs of importers and users in the EU-10 must also be taken into account. On balance, in view of the importance of continued supply for customers in the EU-10, it is considered that this outweighs the concerns of the Community Industry.
(21) No other comments or submissions were made which caused the Commission to alter its views on the matter,","{'header': '20.11.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/37', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 19 November 2004\naccepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of silicon carbide originating,inter alia, in Ukraine\n(2004/782/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertaking offered by the exporting producer mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of silicon carbide originating in Ukraine is hereby accepted:\nCountry\nCompany\nTaric Additional Code\nUkraine\nProduced and exported by Open Joint Stock Company ‘Zaporozhsky Abrasivny Combinat’, Zaporozhye, Ukraine, to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA523'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nand remain in force until 20 May 2005.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents (1), and in particular Article 15 and 12(2) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 29 October 2010, the German Federal Environment Agency notified the Commission and the other Member States of their temporary prohibition for the placing on the German market of the cleaning product POR-ÇÖZ with a nitric acid content of 20 % or more, based on risks of corrosion and dangerous fumes resulting from the ingredient nitric acid (3).
(2) The German authorities additionally notified the temporary prohibition of POR-ÇÖZ to the Commission via RAPEX (4) under Article 12 of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (5). As an additional risk it was mentioned that the POR-ÇÖZ containers did not have sufficiently child-proof caps.
(3) POR-ÇÖZ is manufactured in Turkey by the registered company Levent Kimya and imported into Germany by the company Karakus Handels GmbH with its registered seat in D-58638 Iserlohn.
(4) POR-ÇÖZ contains 20-30 % nitric acid in aqueous solution. Nitric acid is classified as corrosive to the skin, category 1, under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) concerning classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures.
(5) POR-ÇÖZ is marketed as a limescale and rust remover to the general public. It is a mixture intended for cleaning purposes and is therefore a detergent according to Article 2 of the Regulation.
(6) Based on the presentation of facts in the German RAPEX notification, the product POR-ÇÖZ is not fitted with appropriate child-resistant fastenings. Consequently, it does not comply with Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 in combination with Article 9, paragraph 1.3 and Annex IV, Part A of Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations and does not fall under Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 which is applicable only to products that are ‘complying with the requirement of this Regulation’.
(7) A clarification of the facts was made orally by Germany at the meeting of the Detergents Working Group on 14 December 2010. Germany explained that there had been two products under the brand name POR-ÇÖZ on the German market. The product referred to in the notification to the Commission of 29 October 2010, which was imported by Karakus Handels GmbH, was correctly labelled and fitted with appropriate child-resistant fastening. The second POR-ÇÖZ product by the same manufacturer was imported illegally via unknown channels. It was labelled in Turkish language and was not fitted with sufficiently child-proof fastenings.
(8) By letter of 22 December 2010, Germany confirmed that the product to which Germany had referred in its notification of 29 October 2010 (manufactured by Levent Kimya and imported into Germany by the company Karakus Handels GmbH) was complying with the Detergents Regulation, notably with its labelling and packaging requirements by having a German-language label and by being fitted with child-proof fastening. The RAPEX Notification No 1760/10 has been modified with a revised notification submitted to the Commission on 16 December 2010, which stated that the grounds for prohibition were not non-compliance with legal requirements but the product’s high risks for human health.
(9) Based on these facts, Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 is applicable, as the product POR-ÇÖZ referred to in the German notification is a detergent complying with the requirements of that Regulation.
(10) Germany has provided justifiable grounds for believing that the product POR-ÇÖZ constitutes a risk to safety or health of humans. Germany reported that one case of child injury is attributed to the use of POR-ÇÖZ in Germany. Furthermore, between 1999 and 2010, German poison centres registered 134 cases of severe injuries to health related to the use in households of lime and rust removers containing nitric acid. In Belgium (the only other Member State where a Turkish-labelled version of POR-ÇÖZ had been found on the market) anti-poison centres have recorded three cases of severe respiratory problems resulting from the professional use of limescale removers containing 30 % nitric acid. Based on an assessment of the risks to health from the use of cleaning products with a nitric acid content of 20-30 %, on 28 September 2010, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment recommended that cleaning products containing more than 20 % nitric acid should not be placed on the market for supply to the general public (8).
(11) The Commission has consulted the Member States both via questionnaires sent out on 15 November 2010 and in a meeting of the Detergents Working Group Meeting on 14 December 2010. The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with their opinion as expressed in the Committee opinion of 14 March 2011,","{'header': '8.4.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 94/29', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 6 April 2011\non the temporary prohibition of the placing on the market in Germany of the detergent POR-ÇÖZ\n(notified under document C(2011) 2290)\n(2011/225/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 29 October 2010, the German Federal Environment Agency notified the Commission and the other Member States of their temporary prohibition for the placing on the German market of the cleaning product POR-ÇÖZ with a nitric acid content of 20\xa0% or more, based on risks of corrosion and dangerous fumes resulting from the ingredient nitric acid(3).\n\n((2)) The German authorities additionally notified the temporary prohibition of POR-ÇÖZ to the Commission via RAPEX(4)under Article 12 of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety(5).

","COMMISSION  DECISION of 4 April 1995 on German aid to the coal industry for 1995 (Only the German text is  authentic) (Text with EEA relevance) (95/464/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community  rules for State aid to the coal industry  (1), and in particular Articles 2 (1) and 9 thereof,
Whereas:
I
By letter of 25 January 1995, Germany notified the Commission, in accordance with Article 9 (1)  of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of the aid it intended to grant to the coal industry in 1995.
In accordance with that Decision, the Commission establishes the following measures for 1995:
-  aid totalling DM 95 million for maintaining the underground labour force ('Bergmannspraemie`),
-  aid totalling DM 5  900 million under the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law of 13 December 1974   (2) ('drittes Verstromungsgesetz`) in the form of revenue from the compensation fund  ('Ausgleichsfonds`) for 1995. This corresponds to a levy rate ('Kohlepfennig`) of 8,5  %,
-  aid totalling DM 200 million to cover exceptional costs for the undertakings Ruhrkohle AG,  Saarbergwerke AG, Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria, Sophia Jacoba GmbH and Preussag.
The financial measures proposed by the Federal Government for the coal industry comply with the  provisions of Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and are to be approved by the Commission in  accordance with Article 9. The Commission is to take its decision above all with regard to the  general objectives and criteria defined in Article 2 and the specific criteria defined in Articles  3 and 4 of the Decision. In accordance with Article 9 (6) of the Decision, the Commission is  required to check whether the measures are in conformity with the modernization, rationalization  and restructuring plans on which it expressed a favourable opinion on 13 December 1994 in  accordance with Article 8 (2) and (3).
II
The aid of DM 92,8 million for compensation between coalfields and the aid of DM 50,8 million  for compensation for coal with a low volatile-matter content are intended to provide partial  compensation for the fact that some coal producers receive revenue which is lower than production  costs because of sales to electricity producers. According to the information provided by the  Federal Government, the compensation between coalfields relates to 7,4 million tonnes and the  compensation for coal with a low volatile-matter content to 2,3 million tonnes. Since 1990 this  amount has been reduced by 10  % per annum.
The inclusion of this aid in the modernization, restructuring and rationalization plan and its  gradual reduction will contribute to greater financial discipline in the undertakings concerned.  This aid therefore achieves the objectives set out in the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the  Decision i.e. to make, in the light of coal prices on international markets, further progress  towards economic viability and consequently to reduce aid.
In assessing this aid, the Commission has, in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1),  also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring.
In accordance with Article 3 of the Decision, the aid helps to improve the economic viability of  the undertakings concerned by reducing production costs.
The slight reduction in costs expected in 1995 at constant prices compared with 1994 should  generate a trend towards a reduction in production costs within the meaning of the second indent of  Article 3 (2).
In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government,  the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  smooth functioning of the internal market.

Aid totalling DM 95 million to finance the 'Bergmannspraemie` is planned to enable mining  undertakings to maintain their underground labour force in deep mines. This aid corresponds to DM  10 per underground shift. According to the information provided by Germany, this aid is an extra  payment to miners and also reduces production costs. It is therefore aid which has to be assessed  by reference to Article 3 of the Decision.
The aid contributes to increasing productivity and therefore helps in the restructuring and  rationalization of the coal industry. It therefore also helps to achieve the objectives referred to  in the first indent of Article 2 (1), i.e. to make, in the light of coal prices on international  markets, further progress towards economic viability and consequently to reduce aid.
In assessing this aid, the Commission has, in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1),  also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring.
The slight reduction in costs at constant prices expected in 1995 compared with 1994 should  generate a trend towards a reduction in production costs within the meaning of the second indent of  Article 3 (2).
This aid will improve the economic viability of the undertakings concerned in accordance with the  provisions of Article 3 of the Decision by reducing production costs.
In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government,  the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  smooth functioning of the internal market.
IV
The aid of DM 5  900 million to the coal industry planned by the Federal Government is covered  by the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law which provides for the creation of a compensation fund  financed from a levy, the 'Kohlepfennig`. The purpose of this fund is to provide partial  compensation for price differences between Community coal and imported coal in respect of 11,5  million tce and between Community coal and fuel oil in respect of 23 million tce. The compensation  fund therefore covers 34,5 million tce per annum and benefits electricity producers who purchase  German coal at a price which more or less reflects production costs.
This measure constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 1 (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC,  according to which the term 'aid` also covers the allocation, for the direct or indirect benefit of  the coal industry, of the charges rendered compulsory as a result of State intervention, without  any distinction being drawn between aid granted by the State and aid granted by public or private  bodies appointed by the State to administer such aid. The Commission must therefore take a decision  on this measure in accordance with Article 9 of the Decision.
A decision has been taken each year pursuant to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC  (1) on aid  granted in accordance with the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law. In accordance with Article 9 (7) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the existing rules must be brought into line with the provisions of this  Decision no later than 31 December 1996. If this has not been done, an assessment must be made as  to whether the aid corresponds to the principles set out in Article 2 (1) of the Decision. In this  context it should be pointed out that, by decision of 11 October 1994 (ref. 2 BvR 633/86), the  Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the provisions of the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law  concerning the imposition of the 'Kohlepfennig` levy for the benefit of the German coal industry  are incompatible with the basic law 'Grundgesetz`) and that they must cease to be applied with  effect from 1 January 1996.
The slight increase of 1,7  % in the aid in 1995 compared with 1994 is due to the slight nominal  increase in production costs at current prices (which, however, corresponds to a decrease at  constant prices) and the estimated downward trend in energy prices in German marks of 10  %, which  is itself a result of trends on the world market for coal and heavy fuel oil and changes in the  exchange rate of the German mark to the United States Dollar. The Federal Government has therefore  decided to place an upper limit at current prices on this aid as from 1 January 1996 and gradually  to further reduce it as from 1 January 1997.
In view of the proposed increase in the aid for 1995 of 1,7  % compared with 1994, the Commission  welcomes the Federal Government's decision to introduce a ceiling in 1996 and gradually to further  reduce it within the meaning of the first indent of Article 2 (1).
In assessing this aid, the Commission has, in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1),  also taken account of the urgent need to ease the social and regional impact of restructuring.
In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the Federal Government,  the aid planned for 1995 is compatible with the objectives set out in Article 2 of Decision No  3632/93/ECSC and with the smooth functioning of the internal market.
V
The aid amounting to DM 200 million to cover exceptional costs in favour of the undertakings  Ruhrkohle AG, Saarbergwerke AG, Gewerkschaft Auguste Victoria, Sophia Jacoba GmbH and Preussag is  intended to cover additional costs arising in conjunction with the removal of waste water from pits  which were closed down as part of the restructuring measures and are near working pits. Since  little or no water is drained from the closed pits, some of the water which is not in any way used  in connection with production flows into nearby working pits, thereby creating additional costs.
This aid is expressly referred to in point II (b) of the Annex to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC as a  measure intended to cover expenditure, resulting from restructuring, on the supply of water and the  removal of waste water. In order to comply with the provisions of Article 5 of that Decision, it  may not exceed those costs.
The Commission has examined the information provided by Germany and the agreements between the  State and the undertakings concerned and has come to the conclusions that this condition has been  met.
This assistance will reduce the financial imbalance within the companies concerned and enable them  to continue to operate. The aid therefore complies with the objectives set out in Article 2 (1) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
VI
This Decision does not prejudge the question of whether the new German system of aid which  must be introduced for coal intended for the steel industry is compatible with the Treaties and  with Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. This also applies to the changes which have to be made, in  accordance with Article 9 (7), to the rules on aid which are linked to agreements between coal and  electricity producers.
The Federal Government must ensure that the aid granted pursuant to this Decision does not exceed,  for each undertaking or production unit, the difference between production costs and foreseeable  revenue.
The Commission is required, pursuant to the second indent of Article 3 (1) and Article 9 (2) and  (3) of Decision No 3623/93/ECSC, to verify whether the aid granted for current production achieves  the objectives set out in Articles 3 and 4 of that Decision. It must therefore be informed as to  the level of payments and their allocation,","{'title': '95/464/ECSC: Commission Decision of 4 April 1995 on German aid to the coal industry for 1995 (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nGermany is hereby authorized to take the following measures in 1995  to support the coal industry:\n\n-  aid totalling DM 92,8 million for compensation between coalfields and DM 50,8 million for  compensation for coal with a low volatile-matter content,\n\n-  aid totalling DM 95 million for maintaining the underground labour force ('Bergmannspraemie`),\n\n-  aid totalling DM 5  900 million ion the context of the Third Electricity-from-Coal Law of 13  December 1974 in the form of revenue from the compensation fund ('Ausgleichsfonds`) for 1995,  corresponding to a levy rate ('Kohlepfennig`) of 8,5  %,\n\n-  aid totalling DM 200 million to cover exceptional costs for the undertakings Ruhrkohle AG,  Saarbergwerke AG, Gerwerkschaft Auguste Victoria, Sophia Jacoba GmbH and Preussag.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nGermany shall provide information no later than 30 September 1996 about the amounts  actually paid during the 1995 production year.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Brussels, 4 April 1995.\n\nFor the Commission Christos PAPOUTSIS Member of the Commission'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Italian Government submitted to the Commission on 27 November 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the region of Liguria fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5b pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The plan includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other Financial Instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the single programming document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(8) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing Financial Instruments.
(9) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(10) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this single programming document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/721/EC: Commission Decision of 7 September 2001 approving the single programming document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Liguria in Italy (notified under document number C(2001) 2044)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Liguria in Italy eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5b for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) A preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74252) was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1259/2004 (3), on turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1206/2005 (4), and on laying hens and weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1876/2006 (5). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of that preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) (formerly ATCC 74252), as a feed additive for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens and piglets and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use for all poultry species for fattening and laying, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 17 October 2012 (6) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that it has a potential to favourably affect animal performance in target species. However, based on the incomplete information provided by the applicant, the Authority was not in a position to specify the minimum enzyme activities. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC 74444) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) As a new authorisation is granted in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulations (EC) No 1259/2004, (EC) No 1206/2005 and (EC) No 1876/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '3.5.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 121/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 403/2013\nof 2 May 2013\nconcerning the authorisation of a preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced byTrichoderma reesei(ATCC 74444) as a feed additive for poultry for fattening and for laying and for weaned piglets and amending Regulations (EC) No 1259/2004, (EC) No 1206/2005 and (EC) No 1876/2006 (holder of authorisation DSM Nutritional Products)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes dichlorvos.
(3) For dichlorvos the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For dichlorvos the rapporteur Member State was Italy and all relevant information was submitted on 20 October 2003.
(4) The assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 12 May 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance dichlorvos (4). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 29 September 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for dichlorvos.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns were identified. In particular, based on the available toxicological data and taking into account the uncertainties of the genotoxic and carcinogenic properties of the substance also considering the overall poor quality of the dossier, it has not been demonstrated that the estimated operator, worker and bystander exposure, is acceptable.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments advanced, the above concerns remained unsolved, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing dichlorvos satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Dichlorvos should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing dichlorvos are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing dichlorvos, should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.
(10) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for dichlorvos according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '7.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 145/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 6 June 2007\nconcerning the non-inclusion of dichlorvos in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document number C(2007) 2338)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/387/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 703/2001(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 14 July 2010
terminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia
(2010/393/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) On 30 June 2009, the European Commission (Commission) received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious subsidisation of imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia (the countries concerned).
(2) The complaint was lodged by the European Industrial Fasteners Institute (EIFI) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, in this case more than 25 %, of the total Union production of certain stainless steel fasteners pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 10(6) of the basic Regulation.
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of subsidisation and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding.
(4) Prior to the initiation of the proceeding and in accordance with Article 10(7) of the basic Regulation, the Commission notified the governments of the countries concerned that it had received a properly documented complaint alleging that subsidised imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries were causing material injury to the Union industry. The governments of the countries concerned were separately invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as regards the content of the complaint and arriving at a mutually agreed solution. During the consultations no mutually agreed solution was found.
(5) The Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2), accordingly initiated an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned, currently falling within CN codes 7318 12 10, 7318 14 10, 7318 15 30, 7318 15 51, 7318 15 61 and 7318 15 70.
(6) On the same day, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned (3).
(7) The Commission sent questionnaires to the Union industry and to any known association of producers in the Union, to the exporters/producers in the countries concerned, to any association of exporters/producers, to the importers, to any known association of importers, and to the authorities of the countries concerned. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(8) By its letter of 1 April 2010 to the Commission, EIFI formally withdrew its complaint.
(9) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(10) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Union of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the countries concerned should be terminated,","{'header': '15.7.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 180/28', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 July 2010\nterminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia\n(2010/393/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of certain stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in India and Malaysia, currently falling within CN codes 7318\xa012\xa010, 7318\xa014\xa010, 7318\xa015\xa030, 7318\xa015\xa051, 7318\xa015\xa061 and 7318\xa015\xa070, is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1332/84 (2), and in particular Article 27 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed before the beginning of each marketing year;
Whereas pears are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas pears harvested during a given crop year are marketed from June of one year to May of the following year; whereas the quantities marketed in June and May of the following year are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices; whereas the reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period 1 July up to and including 30 April of the following year;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas to take variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying the specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 122(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the report from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the report from the European Central Bank (2),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (3),
Having regard to the discussion of the Council, meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government,
Whereas:
(1) The third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) started on 1 January 1999. The Council, meeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or Government, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 1999 (4).
(2) The Council decided on 19 June 2000 that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2001 (5). The Council decided on 11 July 2006 that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2007 (6).
(3) In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty, the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.
(4) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC, Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession (7), the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession (8), Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.
(5) The European Central Bank (ECB) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council of 16 June 1997 on the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union (9). The procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 1 September 1998 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (10).
(6) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article, at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. On 13 February 2007, Cyprus submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment.
(7) National legislation in the Member States, including the statutes of national central banks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Statute of the ESCB’). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Cyprus with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
(8) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 (11). In order to assess the price stability criterion, a Member State's inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one-year period ending in March 2007, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability were Finland, Poland and Sweden, with inflation rates of, respectively 1,3 %, 1,5 % and 1,6 %. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2007 was 3,0 %.
(9) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.
(10) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate against any other Member State's currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II has provided the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending 26 April 2007.
(11) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest rate criterion, a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one year period ending in March 2007 was 6,4 %.
(12) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the statistical data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria are to be provided by the Commission. The Commission has provided the necessary data for the preparation of this Decision. The Commission has provided it on the basis of reports submitted by the Member States before 1 April 2007 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (12).
(13) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfilment by Cyprus of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, the Commission concludes that:
— the average inflation rate in Cyprus in the year ending March 2007 stood at 2,0 %, which is below the reference value, and is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead,
— Cyprus is not the subject of a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive government deficit,
— Cyprus has been a member of ERM II since 2 May 2005; in the two-year period ending 26 April 2007, the Cypriot pound (CYP) has not been subject to severe tensions and Cyprus has not devalued, on its own initiative, the CYP bilateral central rate against the euro,
— in the year ending March 2007, the long-term interest rate in Cyprus was on average 4,2 %, which is below the reference value.
(14) According to Article 122(2) of the Treaty the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, is to decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,","{'header': '18.7.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 186/29', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 10 July 2007\nin accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Cyprus of the single currency on 1 January 2008\n(2007/503/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) started on 1 January 1999. The Council, meeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or Government, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 1999(4).\n\n((2)) The Council decided on 19 June 2000 that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2001(5). The Council decided on 11 July 2006 that Slovenia fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2007(6).\n\n((3)) In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland annexed to the Treaty, the United Kingdom notified the Council that it did not intend to move to the third stage of EMU on 1 January 1999. This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.\n\n((4)) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC, Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession(7), the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession(8), Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.\n\n((5)) The European Central Bank (ECB) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council of 16 June 1997 on the establishment of an exchange rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union(9). The procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 1 September 1998 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union(10).\n\n((6)) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article, at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. On 13 February 2007, Cyprus submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment.\n\n((7)) National legislation in the Member States, including the statutes of national central banks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Statute of the ESCB’). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Cyprus with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.\n\n((8)) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95(11). In order to assess the price stability criterion, a Member State's inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one-year period ending in March 2007, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability were Finland, Poland and Sweden, with inflation rates of, respectively 1,3\xa0%, 1,5\xa0% and 1,6\xa0%. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2007 was 3,0\xa0%.\n\n((9)) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.\n\n((10)) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate against any other Member State's currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II has provided the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending 26 April 2007.\n\n((11)) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest rate criterion, a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one year period ending in March 2007 was 6,4\xa0%.\n\n((12)) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the statistical data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria are to be provided by the Commission. The Commission has provided the necessary data for the preparation of this Decision. The Commission has provided it on the basis of reports submitted by the Member States before 1 April 2007 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(12).\n\n((13)) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfilment by Cyprus of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, the Commission concludes that:In Cyprus, national legislation, including the Statute of the national central bank, is compatible with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.Regarding the fulfilment by Cyprus of the convergence criteria mentioned in the four indents of Article 121(1) of the Treaty:—the average inflation rate in Cyprus in the year ending March 2007 stood at 2,0\xa0%, which is below the reference value, and is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead,—Cyprus is not the subject of a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive government deficit,—Cyprus has been a member of ERM II since 2 May 2005; in the two-year period ending 26 April 2007, the Cypriot pound (CYP) has not been subject to severe tensions and Cyprus has not devalued, on its own initiative, the CYP bilateral central rate against the euro,—in the year ending March 2007, the long-term interest rate in Cyprus was on average 4,2\xa0%, which is below the reference value.Cyprus has achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence by reference to these criteria.Consequently, Cyprus fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.\n\n(—) the average inflation rate in Cyprus in the year ending March 2007 stood at 2,0\xa0%, which is below the reference value, and is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead,\n\n(—) Cyprus is not the subject of a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive government deficit,\n\n(—) Cyprus has been a member of ERM II since 2 May 2005; in the two-year period ending 26 April 2007, the Cypriot pound (CYP) has not been subject to severe tensions and Cyprus has not devalued, on its own initiative, the CYP bilateral central rate against the euro,\n\n(—) in the year ending March 2007, the long-term interest rate in Cyprus was on average 4,2\xa0%, which is below the reference value.\n\n((14)) According to Article 122(2) of the Treaty the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, is to decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nCyprus fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for the farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1), and in particular points (a) and (b) of Article 8(2) and the second subparagraph of Article 40(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 10b of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 provides for the possibility for Member States having applied the voluntary modulation in respect of calendar year 2012 to continue reducing direct payments in respect of calendar year 2013. The United Kingdom notified the Commission of its decision to use this possibility, which resulted in Commission Implementing Decision 2013/146/EU of 20 March 2013 fixing the amount resulting from the application of voluntary adjustment in the United Kingdom for the calendar year 2013 (2). It is therefore appropriate to review the corresponding ceiling as referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(2) Greece, Spain, Luxembourg, Malta and the United Kingdom notified the Commission of their intention to provide support to vine-growers for 2014 by allocating payment entitlements in accordance with Articles 103(o) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (3). The respective national ceilings as referred to in Article 40(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 should therefore be adapted accordingly.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 6 March 1984
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of caustic-burned natural magnesite originating in the People's Republic of China
(84/129/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 20 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In June 1982 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Grecian Magnesite Mining Industrial Shipping and Commercial Co. SA on its own behalf and on behalf of all producers of caustic-burned magnesite in the Community, whose collective output constitutes all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of natural magnesite, caustic-burned, falling within NIMEXE code ex 25.19-59, originating in the People's Republic of China, and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 3541/82 (4), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of natural magnesite, caustic-burned, with an MgO content varying between 70 and 91 %, originating in the People's Republic of China. The Commission notified the exporters known to be concerned of its intention to prolong the provisional duty for a further period of two months. These exporters, who represented a significant percentage of the trade concerned, did not object. The duty was consequently extended for a maximum period of two months by Regulation (EEC) No 992/83 (5).
(3) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty the exporters' representatives, certain importers and the Community producers concerned requested, and were granted, an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. Exporters, importers, the Community producers and consumers of the product concerned made written submissions making known their views on the duty.
(4) The exporters and main importers were informed of the essential facts and grounds on the basis of which the Commission intended to recommend definitive action.
(5) In June 1983 the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council for the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on the imports of the product concerned. The Council did not, however, adopt such proposal.
(6) Thereafter, the Commission continued the investigation which covered the comparability of the products involved, the choice of a market-economy non-member country, the normal value and the injury.
(7) The original investigation period (the last six months of 1981 and the first six months of 1982) was extended to include the last six months of 1982 and the first six months of 1983.
B. Like products
(8) The parties involved in this proceeding expressed strongly conflicting opinions concerning the comparability of the products originating in the exporting country, the market-economy non-member country and the Community. The experts appointed by the Commission after the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty to make a study on this matter did not reach sufficiently convincing joint conclusions. The parties concerned were invited for the second
time to suggest names of experts who could make a new study, but were not able to reach agreement concerning the nomination of a person as an objective expert. The Commission itself, therefore, continued the investigation, in particular by contacting all the users who had been made known either by the Community producers or by the importers or any other party.
(9) From the information now available to the Commission, the following conclusions may be drawn with regard to the comparability of the products concerned:
(a) the different microstructure of the raw material (cryptocristalline or macrocristalline) from which the products under investigation are derived has almost no relevance to the vast majority of applications of these products;
(b) the use of rotary kilns for the burning of the raw material does not generally determine the characteristics of the product under investigation. Furthermore, all producers concerned (in the exporting country, in the market-economy non-member country and in the EEC) have both shaft and rotary kilns;
(c) the products concerned all fall within the same Common Customs Tariff subheading;
(d) all the products under investigation have the same main chemical component, MgO, the content varying between 70 and 91 %, and additional chemical components: Fe2O3, SiO2, CaO and Al2O3. The content of these impurities varies by country of origin, the area of extraction and even according to the kiln in which they were burned;
(e) with regard to the applications:
(aa) agricultural uses, constituting by far the most important single application:
- only the MgO component is relevant,
- the exporters and most of the importers have recognized the interchangeability of the products irrespective of the country of origin;
(bb) other uses:
- although some users give preference to a product originating in a particular country, it has not been proven that the products are not generally interchangeable; furthermore, in some cases the users may mix the products from different origins,
- with regard to some uses the products do not seem to be generally interchangeable, mainly because of the different SiO2 content. However, the exporters do not guarantee that the level of impurities will be below a certain limit.
Furthermore, the quantity of the Chinese product, with regard to which the SiO2 content may eventually determine the use, does not represent more than 10 % of the market of caustic-burned natural magnesite in the EEC,
- the Chinese exporters recognized interchangeability with regard to all but one application,
- in their commercial leaftlets the exporters advertise a wide range of uses which are comparable to those of the Community producers.
(10) On the basis of the data under paragraph 9, it is concluded that the products concerned originating in China and Greece are not identical within the meaning of Article 2 (12) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79, but have characteristics closely resembling one another.
C. Normal value
(11) During the proceeding it was repeatedly argued by the exporters and most of the importers that the manufacturers of caustic-burned natural magnesite in China benefit from an exceptional natural competitive advantage over any other producer whose prices could be used by the Commission for establishing normal value. Such advantage was claimed to be due to the exceptionally high purity of the raw material resulting in a much cheaper production process than in other countries.
(12) With regard to the exceptional natural competitive advantages claimed by the Chinese exporters, adjustments of the normal value cannot be made since it is uncertain how these advantages, if they really existed and were not counterbalanced by competitive disadvantages, would be reflected in the normal value if the same conditions existed in the market-economy non-member country, as prices are not only a function of costs, but also of demand. Furthermore, if normal value were to be based on constructed value in a market-economy country, any adjustment of costs established in a market-economy non-member country to take account of alleged natural advantages would involve relying on costs and resource allocations in a non-market-economy country, which Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 was specifically designed to exclude.
(13) In order to determine the normal value in an appropriate and not unreasonable manner, the parties concerned were invited to make proposals regarding the choice of a market-economy non-member country where the raw material and production process might permit the best comparison. Finally Austria was selected by the Commission for the following reasons:
- despite the disagreement amongst exporters and importers, Austria had been suggested by one of the main importers,
- the Community producers, who had proposed Spain in their complaint, did not object to this choice,
- in Austria the extraction of the raw material is relatively simple and there is almost no waste related to the raw material extracted for the manufacturing of the product concerned,
- the Austrian producer manufactures different qualities of the product concerned for a wider range of applications, whereas in Spain the vast majority was sold on the agricultural market only. The wider range of Austrian sales was in exports, and their export prices to the Community were therefore considered as constituting an appropriate and reasonable choice for normal value.
D. Export prices
(14) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
E. Comparison
(15) On the basis of these facts the dumping margin, being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community, amounts to 48 %.
F. Injury
(16) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from China of caustic-burned magnesite increased from 41 380 tonnes in 1979 to 59 951 tonnes in 1982, with a consequent increase in market share from 12 to 16 % in the same period; the resale prices of these imports were lower than those required to cover the costs of Community producers.
The consequent impact on this Community industry has been characterized by a 33 % decrease in production between 1979 and 1982, a significant reduction in utilization of production capacity, a decrease in sales by 33 % between 1979 and 1982, loss of market share, and decreasing weighted average prices since 1981 resulting in losses for the product concerned.
(17) The information available for 1983 shows that the EEC producers were able to increase their production resulting in a higher utilization of production capacity. Their sales within the EEC increased but weighted average selling prices were still not increasing. They were also able to maintain their 1982 market share. Official statistics show a considerable decrease in imports of magnesite from China falling within NIMEXE code 25.19-59 for the first half of 1983.
Community producers thus benefited from the provisional duty in force during the first half of 1983.
(18) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as the volume and prices of undumped imports or the stagnation of demand. However, the substantial increase in dumped imports and the prices at which they are offered for sale in the Community led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of caustic-burned magnesite originating in China, taken in isolation, have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interest
(19) In view of the particularly serious losses which the Community producers are incurring in the production and sale of the product concerned and in order to avoid the Community becoming totally dependent upon external supplies of the products concerned if the Community manufacturers had to cease production of these products, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken. H. Termination of the procedure
(20) The exporters concerned were informed of the main findings of the investigation and commented fully on them. A memorandum was subsequently offered on behalf of all Chinese exporters of caustic-burned natural magnesite in which, among other things, they undertook not to export the product concerned to the Community below certain prices. These prices are set at such a level that injury suffered by the Community producers will be eliminated.
(21) In these circumstances, the memorandum is considered acceptable and the proceeding may, therefore, be terminated without the imposition of an anti-dumping duty.
(22) However, during consultations within the Advisory Committee concerning the acceptability of this memorandum, some delegations objected to this course of action.
The Commission has consequently submitted a proposal to the Council to terminate the proceeding on the basis of the acceptance of the memorandum.
(23) Since the Council did not decide otherwise within one month, the memorandum is considered accepted in accordance with Article 10 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 and the proceeding stands terminated in accordance with Article 9 (1) of the same Regulation,","{'title': ""84/129/EEC: Commission Decision of 6 March 1984 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of caustic-burned natural magnesite originating in the People' s Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe Commission hereby accepts the memorandum submitted on behalf of all exporters of caustic-burned natural magnesite in China in connection with exports originating in the People's Republic of China of caustic-burned natural magnesite falling within subheading 25.19 ex B of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 25.19-59.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of caustic-burned natural magnesite originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 6 March 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nÉtienne DAVIGNON\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 339, 31. 12. 1979, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 178, 22. 6. 1982, p. 9.\n\n(3) OJ No C 162, 29. 6. 1982, p. 2 and OJ No C 192, 27. 7. 1982, p. 7.\n\n(4) OJ No L 371, 30. 12. 1982, p. 21.\n\n(5) OJ No L 110, 27. 4. 1983, p. 28.""}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 15 December 1992  relating to new transitional measures which are necessary to facilitate the move to the system of veterinary checks provided for in Council Directive 90/675/EEC  (92/571/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (1), as last amended by Decision 92/438/EEC (2), and in  particular Article 30 thereof,
Whereas Directive 90/675/EEC makes arrangements for a new system of veterinary checks for products entering the Community from third countries;
Whereas the Commission, in Decision 92/399/EEC (3), adopted certain transitional measures to facilitate the move to the new system of veterinary checks provided for in Council Directive 90/675/EEC;
Whereas it is necessary to lay down new transitional measures which facilitate the gradual implementation of the system established by Directive 90/675/EEC; whereas Commission Decision 92/399/EEC must therefore be revoked;
Whereas, although at this stage controls on harmonized products can be carried out at the external border of the Community, it is nevertheless appropriate that in certain cases, for non-harmonized products, some controls should still be carried out in  the Member State of destination;

1. PROCEDURE
(1) Definitive countervailing duties were imposed on the above product on 14 November 1998 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2450/98(2). Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for an interim review, pursuant to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, from an Indian exporting producer, Chandan Steel Ltd, which participated in the original investigation and is currently subject to a countervailing duty rate of 19,0 %. The company concerned provided sufficient evidence that the continued imposition of the measure was no longer necessary to offset the countervailable subsidy.
(2) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation with the Advisory Committee, announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of an interim review of Regulation (EC) No 2450/98 with regard to Chandan Steel Ltd.
2. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST FOR REVIEW
(3) On 10 May 2000, the company concerned withdrew its request for a review.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 100 and 235 thereof,
Having regard to Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (4),
Whereas, in order to protect the aquatic environment of the Community against pollution by certain dangerous substances, Article 3 of Directive 76/464/EEC provides for a system of prior authorization laying down emission standards for discharges of the substances in List I in the Annex thereto; whereas Article 6 of the same Directive provides that limit values shall be laid down for such emission standards and also quality objectives for the aquatic environment affected by these substances;
Whereas mercury and its compounds are included in List I;
Whereas the Member States are required to apply the limit values except in the cases where they may employ quality objectives;
Whereas, since the pollution caused by discharges of mercury into water is caused, to a large extent, by the electrolysis of alkali chlorides, in the first instance limit values should be established for this industry and quality objectives should be laid down for the aquatic environment into which mercury is discharged by this industry; whereas such discharges should therefore require prior authorization;
Whereas the purpose of such quality objectives must be to eliminate mercury pollution of the various parts of the aquatic environment which might be affected by mercury-bearing discharges from the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry;
Whereas such quality objectives must be laid down expressly for this purpose and not with the intention of establishing rules pertaining to consumer protection or to the marketing of products from the aquatic environment;
Whereas a specific monitoring procedure should be instituted to enable the Member States to demonstrate that the quality objectives are complied with;
Whereas provision should be made for the monitoring by the Member States of the aquatic environment affected by the said mercury discharges with a view to efficient application of this Directive; whereas Article 6 of Directive 76/464/EEC does not provide for the powers to introduce such monitoring; whereas, since the necessary powers of action have not been provided for in the Treaty, Article 235 thereof should be invoked;
Whereas it is important that the Commission forward to the Council, every five years, a comparative assessment of the implementation of this Directive by the Member States;
Whereas, since groundwater is the subject of a specific Directive, it is excluded from the scope of this Directive,","{'title': 'Council Directive 82/176/EEC of 22 March 1982 on limit values and quality objectives for mercury discharges by the chlor-alkali electrolysis industry', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

The competent authority shall determine the area affected in each case and shall select from among the quality objectives listed in paragraph 1 the objective or objectives that it deems appropriate having regard to the intended use of the area affected, taking account of the fact that the purpose of this Directive is to eliminate all pollution.\n\n1. In order to eliminate pollution as defined in Directive 76/464/EEC, and pursuant to Article 2 of that Directive, the following quality objectives are set:\n\n1.1. The concentration of mercury in a representative sample of fish flesh chosen as an indicator must not exceed 0;3 mg/kg wet flesh.\n\n1.2. The total concentration of mercury in inland surface waters affected by discharges must not exceed 1 g/l as the arithmetic mean of the results obtained over a year.\n\n1.3. The concentration of mercury in solution in estuary waters affected by discharges must not exceed 0;5 g/l as the arithmetic mean of the results obtained over a year.\n\n1.4. The concentration of mercury in solution in territorial sea waters and internal coastal waters other than estuary waters affected by discharges must not exceed 0;3 mg/l as the arithmetic mean of the resu.lts obtained over a year.\n\n1.5. The quality of the waters must be sufficient to comply with the requirements of any other Council Directive applicable to such waters as regards the presence of mercury.\n\n2. The concentration of mercury in sediments or in shellfish must not increase significantly with time.\n\n3. Where several quality objectives are applied to waters in an area, the quality of the waters must be sufficient to meet each of them.\n\n4. The numerical values of the quality objectives specified in 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 may, as an exception and where this is necessary for technical reasons, be multiplied by 1;5 until 30 June 1986, provided that the Commission has been notified beforehand.'}, {'id': 'anx_III', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX III', 'text': 'ANNEX III\n\nReference method of measurement\n\n1.

Samples must be properly representative of the quality of the aquatic environment in the area affected by the discharges, and the frequency of sampling must be sufficient to show any changes in the aquatic environment, taking into account in particular natural variations in the hydrological regime. The salt-water fish analysis must be carried out on a sufficiently representative number of samples and species.\n\n4. With regard to the quality objective in 1.1 of Annex II, the competent authority shall choose the species of fish to be adopted as indicators for analysis. For salt waters the species chosen from among those inhabiting coastal waters and caught locally may include cod, whiting, plaice, mackerel, haddock and flounder.\n\nStatement on Article 3 (3)\n\nThe Council and the Commission state that the application of the best technical means available makes it possible to limit discharges of mercury from the site of a new industrial plant using the recycled-brine process to less than 0;5 g/tonne of installed chlorine production capacity.\n\n(1) The definitions of these terms are as given in Council Directive 79/869/EEC of 9 October 1979 concerning the methods of measurement and frequencies of sampling and analysis of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States (OJ No L 271, 29. 10. 1979, p. 44).'}]}"

Through these training courses and seminars, government officials, national authorities and laboratory experts, shall be informed about and trained on Community feed and food legislation and the control requirements for feed and food to be allowed on the Community markets.\nThe Commission contributes to the training of officials in the Member States in that it supplements the training received at national level with training in aspects that are relevant from a Community point of view.\nFor 2008, training actions will concern the following subjects:\n—\nfood and feed control procedures based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point) principles; audit techniques to verify implementation of HACCP systems,\n—\nveterinary and food safety control checks in Border Inspection Posts (airports, seaports and roads/rail),\n—\nfood Hygiene and Control: fish, meat and dairy products,\n—\nprevention, control and eradication of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies,\n—\nplant Health Controls (EC plant quarantine regime for potatoes, EC internal plant quarantine regime, EC plant quarantine regime for imports),\n—\nplant Protection Products (food and feed safety aspects): evaluation and registration,\n—\nzoonoses and microbiological criteria in foodstuffs,\n—\nanimal Welfare: stunning and killing of animals at slaughterhouses and in disease control situation and animal welfare during transport,\n—\nfood law, feed law, animal health and animal welfare and plant health rules (EUR 8\xa0800\xa0000).\nFinancing: through public procurement.\nThe global budgetary envelope reserved for the procurements during the year amounts to EUR 8\xa0800\xa0000.\nFor each of the technical issues mentioned above one or more specific service contracts will be signed. It is estimated to sign around 14 service contracts.

The production of a report on the 2007 activities is part of this.\nFeedback on trainings will be gathered also through an ex-post evaluation. Forms/questionnaires for this purpose will be distributed to a cross section of participants after their attendance at a training event in order to gauge the impact of the training on their professional lives.\nFinally, to better arrange the training programmes, IT equipment and tools, as well as promotional material, information and communication supports need to be financed (EUR 308\xa0000).\nFinancing: existing framework contracts\nIt is estimated to sign around four service contracts.\nIndicative timeframe for signing the contracts: between March and July.\nSummary\nNo\nName\nBudget line\nLegal base\nAmount in EUR\n1\nTraining: external contracts for the execution of the training programme\n17 04 07 01\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004\n8\xa0350\xa0000\n17 04 04 01\nDirective 2000/29/EC\n450\xa0000\n2\nTraining: annual report, ex-post evaluation, IT equipment and tools, promotional material, information and communication support\n17 01 04 05\nRegulation (EC) No 882/2004\n308\xa0000\nTotal\n9\xa0108\xa0000'}]}"

On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the Community is calculated at USD 33,38 million.

(4) The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 33,38 million.
(5) To make sure that there are no delays in the customs clearance of goods removed from the scope of the 15 % ad valorem additional import duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.

Whereas, in Decision 85/355/EEC, the Council determined that field inspections carried out in certain third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species satisfy the conditions laid down in the Community Directives;
Whereas for beet seed that determination includes Turkey;
Whereas examination of the rules of Turkey and of the manner in which they are applied has shown that the prescribed field inspections in Turkey satisfy the conditions laid down in Annex I to Directive 66/402/EEC for sorghum, Sudan grass, hybrids resulting from the crossing of sorghum and Sudan grass and maize and the conditions laid down in Annex I to Directive 69/208/EEC for soya bean and sunflower;
