of 31 May 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 2160/96 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating, inter alia, in Thailand
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 2160/96(2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating, inter alia, in Thailand. The rate of the duty applicable to the net, free at Community-frontier price, before duty, is 13,5 % for Sunflag (Thailand) Ltd, 6,7 % for Tuntex (Thailand) PLC and 20,2 % for all other Thai exporting producers.
B. INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THE MEASURES IN FORCE
(2) The Thai exporting producer Sunflag (Thailand) Ltd (""the applicant"") lodged a request for an interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to it, limited to the aspects of dumping pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the ""basic Regulation""). The request alleged that changed circumstances of a lasting nature, such as increased capacity utilisation and efficiency, had led to a considerably reduced normal value, while at the same time export prices had remained constant so that dumping had ceased and the continued imposition of the measures was no longer necessary to counteract dumping. Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of an interim review, the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) and commenced an investigation.
1. Procedure
(3) The Commission officially advised the authorities of the exporting country of the initiation of an interim review and gave all the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(4) The Commission sent a questionnaire and received detailed information from the applicant.
(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant.
(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 June 1999 until 31 May 2000 (the ""IP"").
2. Product concerned and like product
(7) The product concerned is the same as in the previous investigation, i.e. polyester textured filament yarn (""PTY""). PTY is derived directly from partially oriented polyester yarn and is used in both the weaving and the knitting sectors to make polyester or polyester/cotton fabrics. The product is currently classifiable within CN codes 5402 33 10 and 5402 33 90.
(8) There are different types of PTY, depending on the weight (""denier""), the number of filaments and the lustre. There are also different qualities, depending on the efficiency of the production process. However, no significant differences exist in the basic characteristics and uses of the different types and qualities of PTY. All types of PTY have been and are considered as one product for the purposes of this investigation.
(9) As in the previous investigation, this investigation has shown that the PTY produced in Thailand by the applicant and sold on the Thai market or exported to the Community has the same physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses and therefore is to be considered a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
3. Findings
(a) Normal value
(10) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, it was first established whether the applicant's total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation this was found to be the case since the domestic sales volume of the applicant was at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community.
(11) For each of the types sold by the applicant on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable with the types exported to the Community, it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. This was considered to be the case when, during the IP, the total domestic sales volume of a type represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the same type exported to the Community.
(12) On this basis, it was found that domestic sales were representative of each type exported to the Community.
(13) An examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each of these types could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of profitable sales to independent customers of the type in question. In cases where profitable sales of a type represented 80 % or more of the total domestic sales volume of that type and where the weighted average costs of production of that type were equal to or lower than the weighted average sales price, normal value was based on the weighted average price of all domestic sales made during the IP, irrespective of whether these sales were profitable or not. All relevant types of PTY fulfilled the aforementioned criteria. Consequently, the normal value for each type exported to the Community was established on the basis of all sales, including those made at a loss.
(b) Export price
(14) Since all export sales of the product under consideration were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable.
(c) Comparison
(15) For the purposes of a fair comparison by type on an ex-factory basis and the same level of trade, due allowance was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability. These adjustments were made in respect of transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit and commissions and partially duty drawback, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
(16) During the on-spot verification the applicant made a claim for duty drawback on the grounds that import charges were borne by the like product when intended for consumption in the exporting country but were not paid when the product was sold for export to the Community. With regard to PTA (purified terepthalic acid), one of the main raw materials for which a duty drawback was requested, the applicant did not submit any evidence that the imported raw material in question was physically incorporated in the product concerned sold on the domestic market. This is especially relevant in this case since PTA was both purchased locally and imported and the applicant is a multi-product company. Therefore that claim could not be granted. As regards MEG (mono ethylene glycol), another main raw material of PTY, which was found to be all imported, the adjustment could be granted.
(d) Dumping margin
(17) In order to calculate the dumping margin, the Commission compared the weighted average normal value with the prices of every individual export transaction to the Community, in accordance with the second sentence of Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation. This methodology was followed since it was found that there was a pattern of export prices which differed significantly among different time periods and that a comparison of the normal value and export prices on a weighted average basis did not reflect the full extent of dumping being practised.
(18) The comparison, as described above, showed the existence of dumping for the applicant. The dumping margin established, expressed as a percentage of the total cif value at Community frontier level, duty unpaid, is 4.8 %.
(e) Lasting nature of changed circumstances and likelihood of recurrence of dumping
(19) In accordance with consistent practice it was examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be considered to be of a lasting nature. On the one hand, it should be noted that the applicant's production capacity of PTY had increased compared to that of the last financial year ending in 1999 and the original IP. On the other hand, the investigation showed that the applicant's capacity utilisation rate for PTY had substantially increased between the original and the present IP.
(20) It was also found that the applicant's exports of PTY to non-EC countries during both the last two financial years and the IP had been consistently high. In this context, it should be mentioned that exports to non-EC countries increased considerably between the original IP and the present IP. In addition it was found that, on the basis of the information available, exports to third countries were made on average at prices equal to those in the EC. Moreover, domestic sales of PTY increased significantly over the last two financial years and the IP.
(21) The above findings concerning capacity utilisation, export quantities and prices to third countries, as well as the surge in domestic sales, are viewed as evidence that the 4,8 % margin of dumping is of a lasting nature and it is unlikely that there will be a recurrence of dumped imports at levels similar to those established in the previous investigation.
(22) In view of the finding of a lower dumping margin for the applicant and as this situation is not considered to be of a short-term nature, measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2160/96 on exports of the applicant should be reduced to the level of the dumping margin established for it in the present review, namely, 4,8 %.
(23) Since the amendment of the measures concerns only the applicant and not Thailand as a whole, the applicant remains subject to the proceeding and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent review carried out for Thailand pursuant to Article 11 of the basic Regulation.
(24) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend that the interim review be terminated and that the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2160/96 be amended and were given an opportunity to comment. Their comments were taken into account and, where appropriate, the findings were modified accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1078/2001 of 31 May 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 2160/96 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating, inter alia, in Thailand', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/96 shall be replaced by the following: ""2.

Whereas Article 6(2) of Decision 97/413/EC provides that capacity reductions shall be ensured by the establishment in each Member State of a permanent regime to control the renewal of the fleet, which will determine, segment by segment, the ratio of entries/exits of vessels; whereas the programmes submitted by Member States either contain no information on this issue whatsoever or are unsatisfactory; whereas Member States should therefore communicate the necessary information to the Commission at a later stage;
Whereas Article 7(1) of Decision 97/413/EC provides that the starting point for the objectives fixed for the fishing fleets for 31 December 2001 shall be the fleet objectives fixed by the previous programme for 31 December 1996;
Whereas the objectives fixed by the previous programme should be adjusted in cases where this is justified by new information supplied by the Member State concerned;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 7(2) of Decision 97/413/EC, the particular situation of the fleet of each Member State concerned must be taken into account in fixing the objectives applicable to that fleet;
Whereas Decision 97/413/EC, and in particular Article 9(1) thereof, requires the fixing of annual intermediate targets; whereas since a large part of the first year of the period covered by the programmes will have elapsed at the time of the adoption of the present Decision it is not appropriate to set an intermediate objective for 1997;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 9(1) of Decision 97/413/EC, the Commission shall adopt the detailed rules for the implementation of that Decision; whereas it is useful to clarify certain concepts;
Whereas the starting point for calculating the intermediate and final fleet objectives under MAGP IV are the fleet objectives fixed by the previous programmes for 31 December 1996 (MAGP III); whereas the tonnage objectives set by MAGP III were expressed in gross registered tonnes (GRT), but the MAGP IV objectives must be expressed in units of gross tonnes (GT); whereas not all Member States have submitted GT values for all fishing vessels of the fleet concerned notwithstanding their obligation to measure or estimate the GT of all vessels in their fleet, and to transmit this information to the Commission;
Whereas, in those circumstances, the Commission must, using a practical approach, estimate the missing GT values in order to provisionally determine that Member State's MAGP IV intermediate and final objectives on the basis of those estimates;
Whereas however the Commission cannot accept any claims by Member States that fishing effort and/or capacity has been reduced in as far as they relate to vessels for which the Member State concerned has not fulfilled its obligation to transmit at GT value or estimate to the Commission, since the exact amount of that reduction is not verifiable;
Whereas, in the absence of the required GT tonnage values measured or estimated in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining the characteristics of fishing vessels (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3259/94 (6) and implemented by Commission Decision 95/84/EC (7), the Commission will be unable to verify the percentage changes in the fleet capacity or fishing effort represented by changes in the capacity or activity of individual vessels, or by vessel entries or exits to and from the fleet; whereas the Commission will therefore have to assess whether the fishing effort reductions applied to vessels for which the required GT values are available have been sufficient to be almost certain that a Member State has reached its MAGP IV objectives;
Whereas, since the starting point for the MAGP IV objectives are the final MAGP III objectives, a Member State cannot be deemed to have reached either intermediate or final MAGP IV objectives until it has fulfilled its obligations under MAGP III, and in particular the obligation to reach at least 55 % of the MAGP III obligations by reductions in capacity,
Whereas the segmentation of the fleet must take into account the segmentation adopted by the previous programme;
Whereas in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/94 of 19 January 1994 concerning the Community register of fishing vessels (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 493/96 (9), each Member State must communicate all changes to the situation of the fishing fleet and the evolution of fishing effort by fishery;
Whereas the calculation of the objectives of the programme is based on information supplied by the Member State; whereas it may be necessary to revise the objectives if this information is later found to have been inaccurate;

TABLES OF OBJECTIVES\n\nThe tables specifying the applicable reduction objectives can be found at the end of this Annex.\n\nII. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n1. Identification of segments and fisheries\n\nSegments of the fleet are defined in accordance with Article 1(4) and 4 of Decision 97/413/EC. One or more fisheries may be identified within segments using active gears.\n\nObjectives fixed in terms of fishing effort by fishery are valid provided that the measures to limit fishing effort described in the programme submitted pursuant to Article 6 of Decision 97/413/EC, as approved by the Commission, are respected.\n\nThe objectives fixed must be attained for each of the segments and where applicable for each of the fisheries by the end of the programme.\n\nEach segment of the fleet is allocated a code number by which the segment to which any vessel belongs is recorded in the fishing vessel register of the Community. All changes to the allocation of vessels to segments must be communicated according to the procedures of Regulation (EC) No 109/94.\n\n2. Conversion of tonnage objectives from units of GRT to units of GT\n\nThe objectives of the MAGP III fixed for 31 December 1996 serve as the starting point for the calculation of the objectives of MAGP IV. The tonnage objectives for the MAGP III are converted from units of gross registered tonnes (GRT) to units of GT by the application of the following formula to each of the fleet segments or applicable subdivisions of the fleet segments of MAGP III:\n\nObjective for 31 December 1996 (GT) = objective for 31 December 1996 (GRT) × >NUM>Situation at 31 December 1996 (GT)\n\n>DEN>Situation at 31 December 1996 (GRT)\n\nwhere the situation at 31 December 1996 in GRT incorporates, where necessary, calculations made in accordance with Commission Decision 97/259/EC (1).\n\n3. Calculation of the objectives\n\nThe objectives are expressed in terms of tonnage in GT and power as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 in kW.\n\n3.1. Objectives by segment\n\nWhere a segment comprising small coastal vessels has been identified in accordance with Article 3 of Decision 97/413/EC, the objectives fixed by the MAGP IV are to stabilise capacity at its level at 1 January 1997 or, at the choice of the Member State, to limit capacity to a level corresponding to the objectives of the MAGP III for this segment.\n\nThe capacity objectives for 31 December 2001 for all other segments are calculated by applying the appropriate reduction rate to the capacity objectives by segment for 31 December 1996 fixed by the MAGP III. If the vessels in one or more segments of the MAGP III are redistributed into one or more segments of the MAGP IV, the sum of the objectives for 31 December 1996 of the MAGP III segments concerned gives the sum of the objectives for 31 December 1996 of the new MAGP IV segments so created. The objectives of the MAGP IV segments for 31 December 1996 are calculated by partitioning this sum among the MAGP IV segments according to the size of those segments at 31 December 1996.\n\nThe reduction rate applied to each segment is calculated according to the method described in Annex II to Decision 97/413/EC, in which the pilot reduction rate for the segment is multiplied by the proportion of the catch in weight of the segment that is made up of critical stocks.\n\n3.2. Objectives by fishery\n\nWhere distinct fisheries have been identified in one or more segments, and where the programme for the limitation of fishing effort in each of these fisheries submitted in accordance with Article 6 of Decision 97/413/EC has been approved by the Commission, distinct effort reduction rates are calculated for each of the fisheries. The method of calculation of the reduction rate in each fishery is identical to that for capacity reductions by segment.\n\nThe effort objectives by fishery are calculated by applying the appropriate reduction rate to the baseline level of effort for that fishery. The baseline levels of effort for the fisheries in a segment are calculated by partitioning the effort objective for the segment for 31 December 1996 among the fisheries. The effort objective for the segment is given by the product of the capacity objective of the segment for 31 December 1996 and mean activity of vessels in the segment over the reference period agreed with the Commission. The proportion of the effort objective for the segment allocated to each fishery is decided by the Member State subject to approval by the Commission, and is fixed for the duration of the programme.\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the present Decision, the intermediate objectives expressed in terms of fishing effort will be deemed to have been met if the cumulative fishing effort from the start of the programme to the date of the intermediate objective is equal to or less than the cumulative fishing effort that would have been exerted if all the annual intermediate objectives had been met exactly.\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the present Decision, the final objectives expressed in terms of fishing effort will be deemed to have been met if the cumulative fishing effort over the period of the programme is equal to or less than the cumulative fishing effort that would have been exerted if all the annual objectives had been met exactly.\n\n3.3. Authorised adjustments to the objectives\n\nMember States may at any time submit to the Commission a programme of safety improvements. In accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Decision 97/413/EC the Commission will decide whether any capacity increase foreseen by such a programme justifies a corresponding increase in the objectives of the MAGP IV.\n\nWhere a Member State implements technical measures that result in a reduction in the by-catch of critical stocks, the Commission will, at the request of that Member State, determine whether these measures justify a revision of the weighted reduction rates applicable to the segments or fisheries concerned.\n\nThe Decisions of the Commission concerning the provisions of this paragraph will be taken according to the procedures of Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92.\n\n3.4. Backlog from the previous programme\n\nWhere the objectives for 31 December 1996 have not been achieved, the backlog in a given segment can be made up by a mixture of capacity and activity reductions, provided that a programme for the reduction of effort is submitted to the Commission for approval in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 109/94 and provided that at least 55 % of the backlog for all segments combined is made up by capacity reductions. The reductions in activity resulting from such a programme have been taken into account in order to establish the baseline activity levels for MAGP IV.\n\n4. Implementation and monitoring\n\nThe implementation of the measures to reduce fishing effort for certain segments of fleet require that evidence is given to the Commission by the Member State that the following are available for each of the segments concerned:\n\n- data concerning activity levels before the entry into force of the measures,\n\n- effective tools to manage time at sea, and an ability to manage fishing licence schemes,\n\n- data making it possible to follow the effect of the measures implemented. These effects have to be controllable by the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 (2) relating to control.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n(1) OJ L 104, 22.4.1997, p. 28.\n\n(2) OJ L 261, 20.10.1993, p. 1.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/84/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the authorities of France received on 15 December 2000 an application from Aventis Cropscience France (now Bayer CropScience) for the inclusion of the active substance mesosulfuron (in the form of mesosulfuron methyl) in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2001/287/EC(3) confirmed that the dossier was ""complete"" in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) Germany received an application under Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC on 25 January 2000, an application from Bayer AG (now Bayer CropScience) concerning propoxycarbazone (in the form of propoxycarbazone sodium; former name: MKH 65 61). This application was declared complete by Commission Decision 2000/463/EC(4).
(3) The United Kingdom received an application under Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC on 2 June 1999 from Rohm and Haas France SA (now: Dow AgroSciences) concerning zoxamide (former name: RH-7281). This application was declared complete by Commission Decision 2000/540/EC(5).
(4) For those active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicants. The nominated rapporteur Member States submitted draft assessment reports concerning the substances to the Commission on 12 December 2001 (mesosulfuron), 26 March 2001 (propoxycarbazone) and 10 August 2001 (zoxamide).
(5) The draft assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 3 October 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for mesosulfuron, propoxycarbazone and zoxamide.
(6) The review of mesosulfuron, propoxycarbazone and zoxamide did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made, that plant protection products containing the active substances concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include mesosulfuron, propoxycarbazone and zoxamide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing mesosulfuron, propoxycarbazone and zoxamide and in particular to review existing provisional authorisations and, by the end of this period at the latest, to transform those authorisations into full authorisations, to amend them or to withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Whereas the production of spiced and salted herrings is currently insufficient in the Community to meet the requirements of the user industries in the Community; whereas, consequently, Community supplies of products of this type currently depend to a considerable extent on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to suspend partially the Common Customs Tariff duty for the products in question, within the Community tariff quota, of an appropriate volume for a relatively limited period; whereas, in order not to call into question the development prospects of this production in the Community while ensuring an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to limit the benefits of the tariff quota to products presented in immediate packings of a net capacity of 10 kilograms or more, with an average weight for four whole herrings or six headless herrings exceeding 1 kilogram, to open the quota for a period from 1 January to 31 March 1985, and to fix the volume of this quota at 1 000 tonnes, corresponding to the needs for imports from third countries during that period, and to fix the quota duty at 10 %;
Whereas, in particular, equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of duty for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, arrangements for the utilization of the tariff quota based on an allocation among Member States would seem to be consistent with the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to correspond as closely as possible to the actual trend in the market in the product in question, allocation of the quota should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States as calculated by reference to statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, however, since the quota is an autonomous Community tariff quota intended to cover import needs arising in the Community, for experimental purposes, the quota volume may be allocated on the basis of the temporary import needs from third countries expressed by each of the Member States; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, to take account of possible import trends for the products concerned, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated between certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to meet subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States;
Whereas, to give importers of the Member States some degree of certainty, the first instalment of the tariff quota should be fixed at a relatively high level, which in this case could be 950 tonnes;
Whereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas, each time its additional share is almost used up, a Member State should draw a further share, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, which latter must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3566/84 of 18 December 1984 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain spiced and salted herring falling within subheading ex 16.04 C II of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 234 (2)  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 286 (2) of the Act of Accession provides that the supplementary trade mechanism  (STM) may be applied from 1 January 1991 until 31 December 1995 to products subject to transition  by stages; whereas Article 286 (2) also stipulates that the list of products subject to the STM  must be drawn up before the end of the first stage;
Whereas the STM should be applied to exports of certain products to Portugal; whereas to that end the aforementioned list should include live  bovines, production of which in the Azores makes it advisable to monitor imports, and products of  the pigmeat sector for the period needed to eradicate African swine fever, in view of the market  consequences of the presence of the disease in Portugal; whereas imports of a number of products in  the poultry sector and in the beef and veal sector should also be subject to monitoring under the  STM, until Portuguese production has reached the same level of profitability as in other Member  States;
Whereas the difficulties in the fruit and vegetables sector caused by the over-rapid increase in  exports to the Portuguese market from other Member States make it advisable to apply the STM to  these products as well; whereas the sensitivity of the Portuguese market to certain milk products  also justifies their inclusion in the said list;
Whereas, bearing in mind the structural situation and the localization of the production and  processing of common wheat, barley, maize and rice in Portugal, application of the STM to these  products, limited to the periods which are sensitive as regards the marketing of Portuguese  production, is likely to make it easier, when Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3653/90 introducing  transitional provisions for the common organization of the market in cereals and rice in Portugal(1) is applied,  to dispose of national production,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3659/90 of 11 December 1990 on products subject to the supplementary trade mechanism during the second stage of Portuguese accession', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe supplementary trade mechanism provided for in Article 249 of the Act of Accession shall apply from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1995 to the  products listed in the Annex hereto and imported into Portugal, on the terms set out in Articles  250, 251 and 252 of the Act.\n\nHowever, with regard to common wheat, barley, maize and rice, the supplementary trade mechanism  shall apply only during those periods which are sensitive as regards the marketing of Portuguese  production, as determined according to the procedure provided for in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC)  2727/75(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 1340/90(3), or in Article 27 of Regulation (EEC)  N° 1418/76(4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 1806/89(5).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nAs part of the annual report on the operation of the supplementary trade mechanism,  the Commission will examine any amendments which, as a result of developments in trade, may be made  to the list of the products listed in the Annex and will present, should this prove appropriate,  the necessary proposals to the Council.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that its its  publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 December 1990  For the CouncilThe PresidentV.

Whereas investments for modernizing and creating facilities for the reception of grapes, for fermentation rooms and for wine-making and other equipment for the manufacture of table wine are nonetheless ineligible for financial assistance under Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 where they relate to wines of a type and quality which do not have reasonable marketing prospects and which would lead to an increase in capacity;
Whereas, notwithstanding the criteria laid down by the Commission for the choice of projects to be financed under Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, and in particular under B 3, point 16 of Communication 85/C 78/06 (3), the programme shows that assitance under this Regulation is justified for investments related to the manufacture of quality wines produced in specified regions with an average price not exceeding three times the guidance price, and related to modernizing and creating facilities for the reception of grapes, for fermentation rooms and for wine-making and other relevant equipment, where these investments are being made in regions with structural deficiencies which do not produce top quality wines;
Whereas, notwithstanding the criteria laid down by the Commission for the choice of projects to be financed under Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, and particularly under the second indent of B 3, point 15 (a) of Communication 85/C 78/06, it is justified, considering the peculiarity of the Spanish situation, which is similar to that of Greece, to extend approval of this programme to investments relating to concentrated must and rectified concentrated must where these products are covered by Annex II of the Treaty, if the investments relate to wine processing and marketing facilities, and do not relate to distillation;
Whereas this programme contains sufficient details as specified in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, showing that the objectives laid down in Article 1 of the Regulation can be achieved in respect of the wine sector in Spain; whereas the schedule for implementation of the programme does not exceed the time limit laid down in Article 3 (1) (g) of the Regulation;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 3 of the Additional Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Tunisia (1) stipulates that certain wines having a registered designation of origin falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 25, ex 2204 21 29, ex 2204 21 35 and ex 2204 21 39 and originating in Tunisia, as specified in the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters and produced from the 1977 and subsequent harvests, shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties within the limits of an annual Community tariff quota of 50 000 hectolitres;
Whereas by virtue of the provisions of a common declaration of the Contracting Parties forming an integral part of the said Protocol the accounting of the quantities of the products in question must begin on 1 January each year; whereas to keep this arrangement it is fitting to open the quota in question for the period 1 November 1989 to 31 December 1990 with the consequence that the quota, by applying the pro rata clause, must be fixed at 58 333 hectolitres;
Whereas these wines must be put up in containers holding two litres or less; whereas they must be accompanied either by a certificate of designation of origin in accordance with the model given in Annex D to the abovementioned Agreement or, by way of derogation, by a document VI 1 or an extract VI 2 annotated in compliance with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3590/85 (2);
Whereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas in order for these wines to benefit from the tariff quota, Article 54 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 (3) must be complied with;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey on the other (4) provides that the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall apply, from the date on which the Regulation enters into force, a duty reducing the gap between the rate of the basic duty and that of the preferential duty; whereas the Portuguese Republic is to defer application of the preferential arrangements for the products in question until the start of the second stage; whereas this present Regulation therefore applies to the Community with the exception of Portugal;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the product in question into all the Member States until the quota is exhausted; whereas it is appropriate not to provide for allocation among Member States, without prejudice to the drawing, on the tariff quota, of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to a procedure to be determined; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the tariff quota is used and inform the Member States accordingly;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. This application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of a new use of the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital), as a feed additive for sows, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 was authorised provisionally for piglets and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 666/2003 (2), provisionally for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2154/2003 (3), provisionally for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 (4) and for ten years (Bonvital) for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 538/2007 (5).
(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for sows. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2007 that the preparation Enterococcus faecium DSM 7134 (Bonvital) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (6). It further concluded that this preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation for this additional animal category. According to this opinion, the use of this preparation is efficacious in improving the performance parameters of sows. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for the specific requirements of post market monitoring. This opinion also verified the report on the method of analysis of feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of this preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '20.12.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 335/24', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1521/2007\nof 19 December 2007\nconcerning the authorisation of a new use ofEnterococcus faeciumDSM 7134 (Bonvital) as a feed additive\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (1), and in particular Article 164(2), and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XV of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Union market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be set in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167, 168 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) The third subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1359/2007 of 21 November 2007 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals (5) provides for a reduction of the special refund if the quantity of cuts of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(6) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 614/2011 (6). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas the markets and prices policy, based on modern farms, is the main instrument of the incomes policy in agriculture; whereas full advantage cannot be drawn from such a policy unless it is integrated into the common agricultural policy as a whole,  including a dynamic social and structural policy and the application of the rules on competition contained in the Treaty;
Whereas, in many cases, surpluses can no longer be disposed of on normal terms either inside or outside the Community; whereas, in order to reduce the cost to the budget of disposing of surpluses on markets of third countries and to encourage greater  consumption within the Community, the restrictive price policy should continue to be applied; whereas this objective can be attained, taking into account the new intervention arrangements, by maintaining, for the 1988/89 marketing year, the intervention  price for common wheat, barley, rye, maize and sorghum applied during the previous marketing year;
Whereas, as part of a quality policy, production of common wheat of higher breadmaking quality and production of rye of breadmaking quality should be supported; whereas, accordingly, the special premium for common wheat and of rye, both of breadmaking quality should be left unaltered;
Whereas in 1986/87 the Council began a process of aligning the intervention price of durum wheat on that of common wheat; whereas in view of, on the one hand, the present ratio between the prices of those cereals and, on the other, the imbalance  recorded on the durum wheat market, it is advisable to pursue that process; whereas, accordingly, the intervention price of durum wheat should be further reduced;
Whereas application of Article 68 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal has meant that prices in Spain differ from the common prices; whereas, pursuant to Article 70 (1) of the Act of Accession, Spanish prices should be aligned with common  prices each year at the start of the marketing year; whereas, as a result of applying the criteria for this alignment, Spanish prices are fixed at the level set out below for other cereals than common wheat and maize; whereas, taking into account the  amendments that have been made since accession to the intervention mechanism, the Spanish intervention price for common wheat and maize shall be brought into line, from the beginning of the 1988/89 marketing year, with that applicable in the rest of the  Community,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2222/88 of 19 July 1988 fixing the prices applicable to cereals for the 1988/89 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 For the 1988/89 marketing year, the prices applicable in the cereals sector shall be as indicated in the Annex.', 'text': 'Article 1 For the 1988/89 marketing year, the prices applicable in the cereals sector shall be as indicated in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.', 'text': 'Article 2 This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply with effect from 1 July 1988.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 July 1988.\n\nFor the Council The President Y.

(1) The additional guarantees relating to the implementation of eradication programmes for Aujeszky's disease applicable to intra-Community trade of pigs, and the lists of territories in the Member States where approved disease control programmes are in place, are laid down in Commission Decision 93/244/EEC(3), as last amended by Decision 2001/746/EC(4), which as from 1 July 2002 will be repealed and replaced by the provisions of Decision 2001/618/EC(5), as amended by Decision 2001/746/EC.
(2) By letters dated 14 September 2001 and 18 October 2001, respectively Belgium and the Netherlands have submitted to the Commission information on their control and eradication programme for Aujeszky's disease.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 20 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 14 thereof.
Having regard to the proposal made by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee established by the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Definitive duty
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2075/82 (3), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of standardized multi-phase electric motors having an output of more than 0,75 kW but not more than 75 kW, falling within subheading ex 85.01 B I b) of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE codes 85.01-ex 33, ex 34 and ex 36, originating in the Soviet Union. The Regulation also contained an acceptance of undertakings to raise prices given by exporters from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland and Romania, and terminated the anti-dumping proceedings in respect of imports of these products originating in those countries.
B. Review
(2) The Soviet exporter of the products in question, Energomachexport, Moscow, asked the Commission to review the definitive anti-dumping duty.
C. Undertaking
(3) When requesting the review, the Soviet exporter offered an undertaking to comply voluntarily with minimum export prices. This undertaking should eliminate the injury caused to the Community industry by the exports in question.
(4) The Commission, after consultations, accordingly adopted Decision 84/189/EEC (4) accepting the undertaking given by the Soviet exporter.
D. Repeal of definitive anti-dumping duty
(5) The Council therefore considers that the definitive anti-dumping duty is no longer required to protect the Community interest. Therefore Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/82 should be repealed.
(6) Definitive anti-dumping duties collected from 15 February 1984, the date on which the undertaking took effect, should be reimbursed,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1275/84 of 7 May 1984 repealing the definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of standardized multi-phase electric motors having an output of more than 0,75 kW but not more than 75 kW, originating in the Soviet Union, and terminating the anti-dumping proceedings in respect of the said imports', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/82 is hereby repealed.', 'text': 'Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/82 is hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nDefinitive anti-dumping duties collected as from 15 February 1984 pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 2075/82 shall be reimbursed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe anti-dumping proceedings in respect of imports of standardized multi-phase electric motors having an output of more than 0,75 kW but not more than 75 kW, originating in the Soviet Union, are hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 May 1984.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nM.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to decide in 2004 on the obligations to transmit electronically the information on fishing activities in order to improve the efficiency on management of fishing opportunities and to set up a means of remote sensing in order to detect fishing vessels at sea.
(2) Pilot projects relating respectively to the electronic transmission of information on fishing activities and to the remote sensing, can be carried out, in cooperation with the Commission, in order to assess the technology to be used, before 1 June 2004.
(3) It is therefore necessary, in order to ensure that Member States carry out these pilot projects, to lay down the conditions of application. In particular those conditions should cover, as regards the electronic transmission of information, the information to be recorded and reported by electronic means, and the functions of the systems on board the fishing vessels which record and transmit electronically the information concerned. As regards remote sensing, the conditions should also cover the functions of this system and the areas to be monitored during the pilot projects.
(4) The Commission needs to be informed by the Member States of the progress and the results of the pilot projects, in particular in order to assess the cost-effectiveness of the technologies to be used for improving the effectiveness of fisheries control.
(5) A financial contribution by the Community may be granted in respect of the pilot projects carried out by the Member States, under the conditions set out in Council Decision 2001/431/EC of 28 May 2001 on a financial contribution by the Community to certain expenditure incurred by the Member States in implementing the control, inspection and surveillance systems applicable to the common fisheries policy(2).

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/15/EEC of 5 April 1993 on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil uses (1), and in particular the second sentence of the second paragraph of Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Fuses, including safety fuses as well as cap-type primers, are subject to Directive 93/15/EEC, but they are used for pyrotechnic rather than for explosive purposes. The potential effects of their misuse are likely to be similar to the effects of misuse of pyrotechnic articles which present a low level of hazard and therefore those effects are much less severe in comparison with the other types of explosives. For reasons of proportionality, fuses, including safety fuses as well as cap-type primers, should be exempted from the system for the identification and traceability of explosives for civil use.
(2) The development of the computerised systems needed to implement the system for the identification and traceability of explosives has taken longer than initially expected. A postponement of the application of Commission Directive 2008/43/EC (2) is necessary to provide the explosives industry with extra time to fully develop, test, validate and, thereby, to increase the security of the electronic systems required to implement Directive 2008/43/EC. In order to allow this, the obligation on manufacturers and importers to mark explosives should be postponed by 1 year to 5 April 2013. Additional time is necessary to have the requisite electronic tracking systems implemented by all actors along the supply chain. Furthermore, stocks of explosives with longer shelf-lives which were produced earlier and were not to be marked in accordance with Directive 2008/43/EC will still be in the supply chain and it is impractical to oblige companies to maintain different types of records. The obligations on data collection and record keeping should therefore be postponed by 3 years to 5 April 2015.
(3) Certain articles are too small to affix the code of the manufacturing site and the electronically readable information. On certain other articles, affixing a unique identification is technically impossible due to their shape or design. In those cases, the required identification should be affixed on each smallest packaging unit. Future technical progress may make it possible to affix the code of the manufacturing site and the electronically readable information on those articles. The Commission should therefore carry out a review by the end of 2020 to assess whether the required information can be affixed on the articles themselves.
(4) Directive 2008/43/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(3) In order to preserve the financial interests of the Community and to avoid the subsequent obligation on producers to repay advances, the application of rules on the submission of applications for advances and on the payment of such advances laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 should be suspended.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular Article 8(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the storage costs for sugar and syrups shall be reimbursed at a flat rate by the Member States.
(2) Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3042/78(3), provides that the levy for Community sugar shall be calculated by dividing the total estimated reimbursement by the estimated quantity of sugar which will be marketed during the sugar marketing year in question. The total estimated reimbursement is to be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amounts carried forward from previous marketing years.
(3) Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the monthly reimbursement shall be fixed by the Council simultaneously with the derived intervention prices. The reimbursement laid down for 2000/01 should be used to calculate the levy.
(4) Pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77, the quantity in store to be taken into account for the reimbursement of any one month's storage costs is equal to the arithmetic mean of the quantities in store at the beginning and end of the month in question. For the 2000/01 marketing year, the quantities of Community sugar in store each month may be estimated on the basis of estimated stocks at the beginning of the marketing year, estimated monthly production and the quantities likely to be marketed for domestic consumption or exported during the same month. Total average monthly stocks during the 2000/01 marketing year can be estimated at approximately 86 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar. The total reimbursement for Community sugar can thus be estimated at approximately EUR 283 million for the 2000/01 marketing year. The balance of previous marketing years can be estimated at a positive amount of EUR 3 million. The detailed rules for the application of the system for offsetting storage costs for sugar provide that the levy is to be fixed per 100 kilograms of white sugar. The quantity of Community sugar which will be marketed during the 2000/01 marketing year for domestic consumption or for export may be estimated at approximately 14 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar. The levy for Community sugar should therefore be EUR 2,00 per 100 kilograms of white sugar.

(2) Weather conditions in recent months have been characterised by an extreme drought in certain regions of Austria which has considerably affected the supply of feed and exposed producers to serious income losses from having to sell their livestock in situations where their usual feed cannot be ensured.
(3) It is therefore desirable to find additional local feed alternatives for the month of August to feed livestock until the autumn.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 18(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 21(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one-hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1010/86 of 25 March 1986 laying down general rules for the production refund on sugar used in the chemical industry(4), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1888/2000(5), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 21(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The refunds referred to above must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Application of these quotas results in fixing refunds for the products in question at the levels given in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 844/2001 of 30 April 2001 fixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d)(f)(g) and (h) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999, exported in the natural state, shall be set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 May 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 April 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 175, 14.7.2000, p. 59.\n\n(3) OJ L 214, 8.9.1995, p. 16.\n\n(4) OJ L 94, 9.4.1986, p. 9.\n\n(5) OJ L 227, 7.9.2000, p. 15.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 30 April 2001 fixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2000 (OJ L 243, 28.9.2000, p. 14).'}]}"

of 20 September 2005
amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards the protection of deep-water coral reefs from the effects of fishing in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy (2) provides that the common fisheries policy is to apply the precautionary approach in taking measures to minimise the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (3) establishes restrictions on the use of demersal towed gears.
(3) According to recent scientific reports, and in particular the reports of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), highly sensitive deep-water habitats have been found and mapped in the Atlantic. Those habitats host important and highly diverse biological communities and are considered to require priority protection. In particular, they are defined as habitats of Community interest in Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (4). Furthermore, deep-water coral reefs have recently been included in a list of endangered habitats in the framework of the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (‘OSPAR Convention’).
(4) The protection of these areas from the adverse impact of fishing is entirely consistent with, and required, under Articles 5 and 6 of the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement (5), in particular the provisions requiring the application of the precautionary approach and the protection of biodiversity in the marine environment.
(5) According to scientific evidence, recovery from damage to these habitats produced by fishing gear is either impossible or very difficult and slow. It is therefore appropriate to prohibit the use of fishing gear likely to cause damage to habitats in areas where these are still in a favourable conservation status.
(6) The waters around the Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands contain several known or potential deep water habitats that have until recently been preserved from trawling due to the special access regime defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/95 of 15 June 1995 establishing a system for the management of fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources (6). Regulation (EC) No 2027/95 was repealed by Council Regulation 1954/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the management of the fishing effort relating to certain Community fishing areas and resources (7).
(7) Therefore, it is appropriate to ensure the protection of those areas through an extension of the restrictions on the use of demersal gears contained in Regulation (EC) No 850/98.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 850/98 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '28.9.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 252/2', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1568/2005\nof 20 September 2005\namending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards the protection of deep-water coral reefs from the effects of fishing in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy(2)provides that the common fisheries policy is to apply the precautionary approach in taking measures to minimise the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems.\n\n((2)) Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms(3)establishes restrictions on the use of demersal towed gears.\n\n((3)) According to recent scientific reports, and in particular the reports of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), highly sensitive deep-water habitats have been found and mapped in the Atlantic.

(2) That Decision implements full equivalence for certain animal products by laying down the models of the official health certificates on that basis in accordance with Annex VII to the Agreement between the Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (the Agreement).
(3) In order to facilitate the changeover to the new official health certificates, Decision 2003/56/EC provides for a transitional period of a maximum of 90 days. That transitional period expires on 2 May 2003.
(4) The Joint Management Committee for the Agreement, in its meeting of 27 and 28 February, issued a recommendation concerning determination of equivalence of certification systems for a further range of animal products. That recommendation, leading to full equivalence for those products, needs to be implemented in accordance with Annex VII to the Agreement. Therefore, the model of the official health certificate for those products as laid down in Annex I to Decision 2003/56/EC should also be replaced by the model as set out in Annexes II to V to that Decision.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1) and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC. For active substances for which a notifier fails to fulfil its obligations under these Regulations no completeness check or evaluation of the dossier shall be performed. For ammonium sulphamate, hexaconazole, sodium tetrathiocarbonate and 8-hydroxyquinoline no complete dossier has been submitted within the prescribed time limit. Therefore it has not been demonstrated that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing these active substances satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. As a consequence, these active substances should not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and Member States should withdraw all authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances.
(3) For the active substances for which there is only a short period of advance notice for the withdrawal of plant protection products containing such substances, it is reasonable to provide for a period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks for a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing. In cases where a longer advance notice period is provided, such period can be shortened to expire at the end of the growing season.
(4) For sodium tetrathiocarbonate and 8-hydroxyquinoline information has been presented and evaluated by the Commission together with Member States experts which has shown a need for further use of the substances concerned. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.11.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 324/8', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 November 2006\nconcerning the non-inclusion of ammonium sulphamate, hexaconazole, sodium tetrathiocarbonate and 8-hydroxyquinoline in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these active substances\n(notified under document number C(2006) 5535)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/797/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (Poseican)(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1922/2002(2), and in particular Article 3(6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the French overseas departments, amending Directive 72/462/EEC and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 525/77 and (EEC) No 3763/91 (Poseidom)(3), and in particular Article 3(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 21/2002(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1976/2002(5), establishes the forecast supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001(6) and (EC) No 1454/2001.
(2) The forecast supply balance for the 2002 calendar year for vegetable oils (except olive oil) for processing in the French overseas departments provides for an annual quantity of 8500 tonnes for Réunion. Information provided by the French authorities shows that this will be insufficient to cover the needs of the Réunion processing industry. The quantity should therefore be increased to 11000 tonnes.
(3) The forecast supply balance for the 2002 calendar year for olive oil for the Canary Islands provides for an annual overall quantity of 10550 tonnes broken down as follows: 550 tonnes for virgin olive oil, 9600 tonnes for olive oil and 400 tonnes for olive-residue oil. Information provided by the Spanish authorities shows that the quantities allocated for virgin olive oil and olive oil have now been exhausted. They should therefore be increased by setting the overall quantity for the three categories of oil at 14500 tonnes.
(4) The forecast supply balance for the 2002 calendar year for fruit pulp falling within CN code 2008 and fruit juice falling within CN code 2009 in the French overseas departments provides for annual quantities of 200 tonnes and 50 tonnes respectively. Information provided by the French authorities suggests that these quantities will be insufficient to cover the needs of the processing industry in those departments. They should therefore be increased to 350 tonnes of fruit pulp and 190 tonnes of fruit juice.
(5) The forecast supply balance for the 2002 calendar year for the Canary Islands for products processed from fruit and vegetables provides for annual quantities of 350 tonnes for citrus fruit falling within CN code 2008 30 tonnes and 900 tonnes for other preserved fruits falling within CN code 2008 99. Information provided by the Spanish authorities shows that the quantities allocated for the two products are likely to be insufficient to cover the needs of the processing industry in the Islands. The quantities should therefore be increased to 400 tonnes of citrus fruit and 1050 tonnes of other preserved fruits. By contrast, information shows that the quantities allocated for apricots and fruit mixtures are not being used and consequently those quantities will be reduced by 50 tonnes and 175 tonnes respectively.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly as regards the supply of vegetable oils to Réunion and olive oil to the Canary Islands and the supply of processed fruit and vegetables to the French overseas departments and the Canary Islands.
(7) The forecast supply balance for the 2002 calendar year for the Canary Islands for dairy products provides for an annual quantity of 106300 tonnes for products falling within CN code 0401, i.e. 105000 tonnes for direct consumption. Information provided by the Spanish authorities shows that the quantity allocated for these products is likely to be insufficient to cover the direct consumption needs of the Islands. It should therefore be increased by 8500 tonnes. By contrast, information shows that the quantity allocated for butter is not being used and consequently that quantity will be reduced by 750 tonnes.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of  the markets in the sugar sector  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95  (2), and in  particular Articles 14 (2), 37 (6) and 48 thereof,
Whereas Article 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 stipulates that during the 1995/96 to 2000/01  marketing years, a reduced rate of duty, referred to as 'special duty`, is to be levied on imports  of raw cane sugar originating in particular in the ACP States and in India and referred to as  'special preferential sugar`, for supply to Community refineries pursuant to agreements with those  and other States and on the conditions laid down therein; whereas such agreements are being  concluded with effect on 1 July 1995; whereas the procedures for the conclusion of such agreements  mean that they cannot be implemented in time to ensure regular supplies to Community refineries in  Portugal from that date;
Whereas stocks of raw sugar in those refineries and Community stocks of raw sugar available for  refining are not sufficient to ensure supplies in the coming weeks and whereas there is a serious  risk that stocks may run out, which could lead to the temporary closure of the said refineries;  whereas, therefore, in order to ensure such supplies in the interim and by the same token to permit  the changeover from the former to the new import arrangements to be introduced under the  abovementioned agreements, the necessary transitional measures should be adopted;
Whereas the transitional measures to be adopted should be based on the essential provisions of the  abovementioned agreements, namely the same reduced rate of import duty and the same minimum  purchase price, expressed in ecus (A), to be paid by the refiners; whereas the quantity to be  imported at the reduced rate of duty should also be determined taking into account refining  requirements for the first quarter of the 1995/96 marketing year; whereas, in view of traditional  patterns of trade, existing contracts and the need for the raw sugar to be supplied as quickly as  possible, it is necessary to make transitional arrangements for the raw sugar to be imported from  the ACP States Contracting Parties to the Fourth Lomé Convention;
Whereas, in order to facilitate the utilization of existing stocks in Finland and Portugal for  refining after 30 June, provision should be made for such stocks to continue to qualify after  refining for the adjustment aid applicable to raw sugar imported into those Member States for  refining during the 1994/95 marketing year; whereas, in order to ensure equal treatment, a similar  provision must also be adopted for stocks of raw sugar produced in the French overseas departments  and qualifying for refining aid in 1994/95 pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2225/86  (3), as  amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2750/86  (4), Commission Regulations (EC) No 1459/94   (5), (EC) No 1543/94  (6) and (EC) No 359/95  (7);

Whereas the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation was  signed on 22 July 1972 and entered into force on 1 January 1973;
Whereas, by virtue of Article 28 of Protocol 3 concerning the definition of the concept of  originating products and methods of administrative cooperation, which forms an integral part of the  above Agreement, the Joint Committee has adopted Decision N° 1/89 amending Protocol 3;
Whereas the Joint Declaration annexed to Decision N° 1/88 of the EEC-Switzerland Joint Committee  implemented in the Community by Regulation (EEC) N° 2427/88 (1) provides, under certain conditions,  for a review of the changes made to the rules of origin following the introduction of the  Harmonized System; whereas, by virtue of that Joint Declaration, the Joint Committee must take a  decision within a period of three months of a request being made to it by either of the parties to  the Agreement;
Whereas this review concerns cases where the transposition of the existing rules of origin into the  Harmonized System was not entirely neutral and where it is necessary to restore the substance of  previous former rules of origin;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2), and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XVII of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Union market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Regulation (EU) No 949/2010 (5). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '21.1.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 18/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 46/2011\nof 20 January 2011\nfixing the export refunds on pigmeat', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XVII of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Union market may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.\n\n((3)) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.\n\n((4)) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin(2).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 141 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 25 October 1999, Finland notified the Commission, pursuant in particular to Article 143 of the Act of Accession and Article 88 of the EC Treaty, a national aid programme implementing in particular Article 141 and comprising other related measures for regions A and B and the Archipelago of regions A and B.
(2) On 6 December 1999, Finland submitted an amended version of this programme.
(3) Parts of this programme were approved by Commission Decision 2000/167/EC of 22 December 1999 approving a Finnish national aid programme implementing in particular Article 141 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden(1).
(4) On 31 January 2000 Finland notified to the Commission, pursuant to Article 143 of the Act of Accession, a request to modify that programme in three respects.
(5) The first request concerns the milk sector: it would allow for the possibility of including in the quota eligible for aid unused reference quantities allocated to producers during the same marketing year. Since Commission Decision 95/196/EC of 4 May 1995 on the long-term national aid scheme for agriculture in the northern regions of Finland(2), as amended by Decision 97/279/EC(3), already provides for this possibility, the Commission considers this request to be justified, in particular in the interest of avoiding any discrimination between producers in different parts of Finland.
(6) The second request concerns the bovine sector and would entail the deletion of the upper limit of 90 male bovine animals eligible for aid on each holding. Since, in accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(4), Finland has decided not to apply this upper limit under the common organisation of the market, it appears appropriate to remove the limit in respect of national aid as well. Furthermore, Finland has explained that such a limit is also contrary to the aim of improving production structures in southern Finland, which is one of the prerequisites for the full integration of Finnish agriculture into the common agricultural policy.
(7) The third request also concerns the bovine sector and is intended to harmonise the terminology used to define the conversion factors for livestock units with that used in Decision 95/196/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999; this request appears justified in the interests of transparency and administrative simplification.
(8) Decision 2000/167/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'title': '2000/364/EC: Commission Decision of 14 March 2000 modifying Decision 2000/167/EC approving a Finnish national aid programme implementing in particular Article 141 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden (notified under document number C(2000) 835) (Only the Finnish and the Swedish texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 2000/167/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter ""the Directive"") provides for the development of a Community list of active substances authorised for incorporation in plant-protection products.
(2) A dossier for the active substance QRD 133 WP (Bacillus subtilis strain QST 713) was submitted by AgraQuest to the authorities of Germany on 19 April 2000 with a view to obtaining its inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.
(3) The authorities of Germany have indicated to the Commission that, on preliminary examination, the dossier appears to satisfy the data and information requirements of Annex II to the Directive. Further, they believe that the dossier contains the data and information required by Annex III to the Directive in respect of one plant-protection product containing that active substance. Subsequently, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2), the dossier was forwarded by the applicant to the Commission and other Member States.
(4) The dossier was referred to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 1 September 2000.

","Council Directive
of 21 December 1978
prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances
(79/117/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission [1],
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament [2],
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee [3],
Whereas plant production has a very important place in the European Economic Community;
Whereas the yield from that production is continually being affected by harmful organisms and weeds; whereas it is absolutely essential to protect plants against these risks to prevent a fall in yields and thereby help to ensure the availability of supplies;
Whereas one of the most important methods of protecting plants and plant products and of increasing the productivity of agriculture is to use plant protection products;
Whereas the effects of these plant protection products may not be wholly favourable for plant production; whereas their use may involve risks for man and the environment since, in the main, they are toxic substances or preparations having dangerous effects;
Whereas, in the case of certain plant protection products, these risks are so great that their use can no longer be wholly or partially tolerated;
Whereas the Member States have therefore not only controlled the marketing of plant protection products but have also introduced, for certain plant protection products, restrictions or prohibitions of use covering also their marketing;
Whereas these provisions differ in the various Member States and result in obstacles to trade which directly affect the establishment and functioning of the common market;
Whereas it is therefore desirable to eliminate these obstacles by aligning the relevant provisions laid down in the Member States by law, regulation or administrative provision;
Whereas it therefore seems justified, as a basic principle, to introduce prohibitions of the use of all plant protection products containing active substances which, even when properly used for the purpose intended, give rise or are likely to give rise to harmful effects on human or animal health or to unreasonable adverse effects on the environment;
Whereas for some of these plant protection products national derogations may, however, be permitted to a limited extent for those uses where, for ecological reasons, a particular need exists and where the risk is less than in the case of their other previously sanctioned uses;
Whereas even these derogations should be phased out as soon as less hazardous treatments become available;
Whereas, on the other hand, it is necessary to grant Member States a limited right to suspend temporarily, on their own authority, prohibitions of use in the event of an unforeseeable danger threatening plant production which cannot be contained by other means;
Whereas the Directive excludes plant protection products intended for research and analytical purposes;
Whereas, moreover, it is not appropriate to apply Community provisions to plant protection products intended for export to third countries, since in general these countries have their own regulations;
Whereas the implementation of this Directive and the adaptation of its Annex to the development of technical and scientific knowledge necessitates a close cooperation between the Commission and Member States; whereas the procedure — for the present, limited in time — of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and involvement of the Scientific Committee for Pesticides offers a suitable basis for this,","{'title': 'Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Directive concerns prohibition of the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:\n\n1.

(2) The foot-and-mouth disease situation in certain parts of the Netherlands is liable to endanger the herds in other parts of the territory of the Netherlands and in other Member States in view of the placing on the market and trade in live biungulate animals and certain of their products. However, the last case was reported on 21 April 2001.
(3) Council Directive 85/511/EEC(6), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, introduced Community measure for the control of foot-and-mouth disease.
(4) In accordance with Commission Decision 2001/246/EC(7), as amended by Decision 2001/279/EC(8), laying down the conditions for the control and eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in application of Article 13 of Directive 85/511/EEC, the restrictions applied to the vaccination zone continue to be applicable, however, all vaccinated animals have been slaughtered by 25 May 2001 in the area around Oene and by 14 May 2001 in the area around Kootwijkerbroek.
(5) In the light of the disease evolution it appears therefore appropriate to further ease the movement of susceptible animals from the areas outside those listed in Annex I.
(6) At the meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee of 12 June 2001 the Netherlands reiterated in relation to the proposed amendments of Decision 2001/223/EC that:

- meat destined for intra-Community trade and export will be completely separated from meat bearing the health mark provided for in Decision 2001/305/EC, and will come from establishments where no meat bearing the health mark provided for in Decision 2001/305/EC is present,

on laying down guidelines relating to inter-transmission system operator compensation and a common regulatory approach to transmission charging
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (1), and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 provides for the establishment of an inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism. In accordance with that Regulation, the Commission is to establish the guidelines specifying details of the procedure and methodology to be applied in the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism and appropriate rules leading to a progressive harmonisation of the setting of charges under national tariff systems.
(2) Valuable experience has been gained since the need for intertransmission system operator compensation mechanism was first recognised, in particular through voluntary mechanisms by transmission system operators. However, transmission system operators have found it increasingly difficult to reach agreement on such voluntary mechanisms.
(3) Binding guidelines establishing an inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism should provide a stable basis for the operation of the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism and fair compensation to transmission system operators for the costs of hosting cross border flows of electricity.
(4) Transmission system operators from third countries or from territories which have concluded agreements with the Union whereby they have adopted and are applying Union law in the field of electricity should be entitled to participate in the inter-transmission system compensation Mechanism on an equivalent basis to transmission system operators from Member States.
(5) It is appropriate to allow transmission system operators in third countries which have not concluded agreements with the Union whereby they have adopted and are applying Union law in the field of electricity to enter into multi-party agreements with the transmission system operators in the Member States which enable all parties to be compensated for the costs of hosting cross-border flows of electricity on a fair and equitable basis.
(6) Transmission system operators should be compensated for energy losses resulting from hosting cross border flows of electricity. Such compensation should be based on an estimate of what losses would have been incurred in the absence of transits of electricity.
(7) A fund should be established to compensate transmission system operators for the costs of making infrastructure available to host cross border flows of electricity. The value of this fund should be based on a Union wide assessment of the long run average incremental costs of making infrastructure available to host cross border flows of electricity.
(8) Transmission system operators in third countries should face the same costs for using the Union transmission system as transmission system operators in Member States.
(9) Variations in charges applied to producers of electricity for access to the transmission system should not undermine the internal market. For this reason average charges for access to the network in Member States should be kept within a range which helps to ensure that the benefits of harmonisation are realised.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003,","{'header': '3.9.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 233/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 774/2010\nof 2 September 2010\non laying down guidelines relating to inter-transmission system operator compensation and a common regulatory approach to transmission charging\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 provides for the establishment of an inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   PROCEDURE
1.1.   Previous investigation and existing countervailing measures
(1) In April 2011, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 405/2011 (2) (‘the definitive Regulation’), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain stainless steel bars and rods (‘SSB’) currently falling within CN codes 7222 20 21, 7222 20 29, 7222 20 31, 7222 20 39, 7222 20 81 and 7222 20 89 and originating in India. The investigation, which led to the adoption of the definitive Regulation, is hereinafter referred to as ‘the original investigation’.
(2) The definitive measures consisted of ad valorem countervailing duties, ranging between 3,3 % and 4,3 % imposed on imports from individually named exporters, a 4,0 % duty rate imposed on non-sampled cooperating companies and a residual duty rate of 4,3 % imposed on all other companies in India.
1.2.   Initiation of a partial interim review
(3) A request for a partial interim review was lodged by Viraj Profiles Vpl. Ltd, an exporting producer located in India (‘the applicant’). The request was limited in scope to the examination of subsidisation as far as the applicant was concerned. The applicant had provided prima facie evidence that the circumstances with regard to subsidisation on the basis of which measures were imposed had changed significantly and that those changes were of a lasting nature.
(4) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission announced on 9 August 2012, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3) (‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of a partial interim review, in accordance with Article 19 of the basic Regulation, limited to the examination of subsidisation in respect of the applicant.
1.3.   Review investigation period
(5) The review investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 (‘the review investigation period’ or ‘RIP’).
1.4.   Parties concerned by the investigation
(6) The Commission officially informed the applicant, the Government of India (‘the GOI’) and Eurofer as the representative of the Union industry in the original investigation (‘the Union industry’), of the initiation of the partial interim review investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
(7) The written and oral comments submitted by the parties at the stage of initiation were considered and, where appropriate, taken into account.
(8) In order to obtain the information necessary for its investigation, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to the GOI.
(9) Replies to the questionnaire were received from the applicant and from the GOI.
(10) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the determination of subsidisation. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the applicant.
2.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(11) The product under review is the same product as the one defined in the original investigation, namely stainless steel bars and rods, not further worked than cold-formed or cold finished, other than bars and rods of circular cross-section of a diameter of 80 mm or more, currently falling within CN codes 7222 20 21, 7222 20 29, 7222 20 31, 7222 20 39, 7222 20 81 and 7222 20 89 and originating in India.
3.   SUBSIDISATION
3.1.   Introduction
(12) On the basis of the information submitted by the GOI and interested parties and the replies to the Commission’s questionnaire, the following schemes allegedly used by applicant were investigated:
(a) Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS);
(b) Export Oriented Units Scheme (EOU);
(c) Export Credit Scheme (ECS);
(13) Schemes (a) and (b) are based on the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act 1992 (No 22 of 1992) which entered into force on 7 August 1992 (‘Foreign Trade Act’). The Foreign Trade Act authorises the GOI to issue notifications regarding the export and import policy. These are summarised in a document called ‘Foreign Trade Policy’ documents, issued by the Ministry of Commerce every five years and updated regularly. The Foreign Trade Policy document relevant to the RIP is the ‘Foreign Trade Policy 2009-2014’ (‘FTP 09-14’). In addition, the GOI also sets out the procedures governing the FTP 09-14 in a ‘Handbook of Procedures, Volume I’ (‘HOP I 09-14’), which is updated on a regular basis.
(14) The ECS scheme specified under (c) is based on sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act 1949, which allows the Reserve Bank of India to direct commercial banks in the field of export credits.
(15) Furthermore, following the allegation of the Union industry, the Commission investigated whether the applicant:
(a) was benefiting from the Electricity Duty Exemption Scheme (EDES);
(b) was using local subsidy programmes of the State of Maharashtra;
(c) was benefiting from provisions of inputs for less than adequate remuneration;
(d) was benefiting from incentives related to power generation and distribution;
(e) was benefiting from purchases of cheap raw materials from related off-shore companies.
(16) Finally, the Commission verified that the following schemes investigated in the original investigation:
(a) Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPBS);
(b) Advanced Authorization Scheme (AAS);
3.2.   Findings
3.2.1.   Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme
(17) The investigation revealed that the applicant used this scheme during the RIP. However, it was found that the incentives received were insignificant at 0,02 %. Therefore, it was considered that it was not necessary to further evaluate the countervailability of this scheme.
3.2.2.   Export Oriented Unit Scheme
(18) It was found that the applicant had the status of EOU and received the subsidies under this scheme in the RIP.
(19) With regard to this scheme the company claimed that the Commission should deviate from the method of calculation of the benefit received under EOU used in the original investigation. The company argued that certain benefits under the EOU scheme should be treated as a permissible duty drawback scheme within the meaning of Annexes II and III of the basic Regulation and therefore they should not be countervailable.
(20) However, since it was found that regardless of which method of calculation would be used, the subsidy rate established with respect to this scheme would not exceed 0,22 %, leading to an overall subsidy margin below de minimis level, it was decided not to analyse further this claim in the context of this review investigation.
3.2.3.   Export Credits Scheme
(21) It was found that the applicant was not using this scheme in the RIP.
3.2.4.   Electricity Duty Exemption Scheme
(22) The investigation revealed that the applicant used this scheme during the RIP. However, it was found that the incentives received were insignificant. Therefore, it was considered that it was not necessary to further evaluate the countervailability of this scheme.
3.2.5.   Local Subsidy Programs of the State of Maharashtra
(23) It was found that the applicant was not using this scheme in the RIP.
3.2.6.   Others
(24) The investigation did not reveal any other benefits for the applicant in the RIP related to the terms of raw materials and energy purchases which would involve a financial contribution of the GOI and could therefore be treated as subsidies within the meaning of Article 3(1)(a)(ii) and Article 3(2) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, the allegations of the Union industry listed in the recital (15) points (c)-(e) were found irrelevant in the context of this review.
4.   AMOUNT OF COUNTERVAILABLE SUBSIDIES
(25) It is recalled that the original investigation established the amount of countervailable subsidies for the applicant, expressed ad valorem, at 4,3 %.
(26) During the RIP, the amount of countervailable subsidies for the applicant, expressed ad valorem, resulting from only one subsidy scheme, was found to be 0,22 %.
(27) Account taken of the above, it is concluded that the level of subsidisation with regard to the applicant exporting producer concerned has decreased.
(28) It was also examined whether the changed circumstances with regard to the examined schemes could be considered to be of a lasting nature.
(29) As mentioned above, the findings with regard to the EPCGS scheme during this interim review confirmed the findings of the original investigation where the subsidy granted under this scheme was found to be insignificant.
(30) Moreover, while in the original investigation the main benefit to the applicant was conferred under the EOU scheme, the benefit under this scheme has dropped during the RIP. Evidence has been obtained that this change is of a lasting nature as it relates to the decreased level of customs tariffs on stainless steel scrap and ferro-nickel, two main raw materials used by the applicant for the production of the product concerned.
5.   COUNTERVAILING MEASURES
(31) On the basis of the above there are indications that the applicant will continue to receive subsidies in the future of an amount which is below the de minimis level. Hence, it is considered appropriate to amend the countervailing duty rate applicable to the applicant in order to reflect the current level of subsidisation. Such duty rate should be established at 0 % for the applicant.
(32) With regard to the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from exporting producers listed in the Annex to the definitive Regulation, it is noted that the current detailed arrangements of the investigated schemes and their countervailability have not changed with respect to the previous investigation. Thus there is no reason to re-calculate the subsidy and duty rates of these companies. Consequently, the rates of the duty applicable to the companies listed in the Annex to the definitive Regulation remain unchanged.
(33) With regard to all other companies’ duty rate, it is noted that in the original investigation its level was set at the level of the highest individual subsidy margin found for the sampled companies. That corresponded to the subsidy margin of the applicant. Given that the margin of the applicant has changed following this interim review, the all-other-companies rate should be revised and set at the next highest subsidy margin. Since the next highest rate is the one applicable to the companies listed in the Annex, the rate of duty for all other companies should be set at that level, i.e. 4 %.
6.   DISCLOSURE
(34) The GOI and the other interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations upon which it was intended to propose to amend the duty rate applicable to the applicant.

(3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(4), apply to this invitation to tender.
(4) With a view to sound market management, the tender should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92/94(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6), while some destinations should be excluded.
(5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 816/2003(8), the amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of that Article specify the operative events applicable to advances and securities.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1877/2003 of 24 October 2003 opening an invitation to tender for the refund on export of wholly milled and parboiled long-grain B rice to certain third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the draft Directive submitted by the Commission,

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas, in order to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the Treaty, the Commission must have at its disposal consistent, synchronized and regular statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of goods by inland waterway in the Member States ; whereas these data must be comparable both as between States and also with the data for other modes of transport and must refer to national, international and transit traffic;
Whereas, since variations during the year in the demand for transport and in the conditions of navigability have an influence on goods traffic, certain statistics should be submitted at intervals of less than one year;
Whereas, in order to secure adequate information on the market for the carriage of goods by inland waterway, such statistical data should distinguish between the main transport links;
Whereas the statistics already available in the different Member States on goods carriage should be further harmonized at Community level;
Whereas, in order to facilitate the implementation of the proposed provisions, certain time limits should be laid down for providing the necessary statistical information;
Whereas the Commission should submit a report in order to enable the Council to examine the extent to which the objectives of this Directive can be attained by using the statistical data submitted ; whereas it should therefore envisage the possibility of proposing improvements to the methods used in compiling these statistics ; whereas the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, should decide on the introduction of statistics on the carriage of goods by sea-going vessels on inland waterways, and statistics on international traffic between regions on such waterways;
Whereas statistical data are necessary for ascertaining the scale and development of the carriage of goods ; whereas the Community should therefore, for an initial period, make a financial contribution to Member States in respect of the work involved,  (1)OJ No C 85, 8.4.1980, p. 75.

Whereas, subject to a number of exceptions, Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 prohibited all new plantings of vines up to 31 August 1990; whereas Article 30f nevertheless provides that rights for new vine-planting on areas intended for the production of quality wines psr acquired before 1 May 1984 may be exercised in certain circumstances; whereas the said Article provides in particular that, from 1 September 1984, such rights may be exercised subject to confirmation from the Member State concerned, this confirmation being confined to quality wines psr for which an authorization has been granted by the Commission under the procedure provided for in Article 67 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79;
Whereas on 4 July 1984, the French Government requested authorization, on the basis of the said Article 30f, for a number of quality wines psr;
Whereas an examination of this request has shown that the planting authorizations which were granted by the French Government for certain quality wines psr on 25 April 1983 and 7 March 1984, constitute administrative acts which did in fact create rights before 1 May 1984 which qualify for confirmation within the meaning of the said Article 30f; whereas, moreover, in the light of the situation regarding the quality wines psr in question, the confirmation of these rights is not likely to disturb the balance of the wine market;
Whereas, on the other hand, no individual decisions have yet been taken concerning requests submitted for the 1984/85 wine year; whereas, therefore, these requests could not be taken into consideration unless a request with a view to the application of the second subparagraph of Article 30 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, accompanied by the supporting documents required, were submitted by the French Government;

COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 24 July 2012
authorising Denmark to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 75 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax
(2012/447/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter registered with the Commission on 5 September 2011, Denmark requested authorisation to apply a measure derogating from the provisions of Directive 2006/112/EC governing the right to deduct input tax.
(2) The Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by Denmark by letter dated 14 March 2012. By letter dated 15 March 2012, the Commission notified Denmark that it had all the information that it considered necessary to consider the request.
(3) Currently, pursuant to Directive 2006/112/EC, if a light goods vehicle with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes is registered with the Danish authorities as being used for business purposes only, the taxable person is authorised to deduct, in full, the input tax on the purchase and running costs of the vehicle. If such a vehicle is subsequently used for private purposes, the taxable person loses the right to deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase cost of the vehicle.
(4) Given that that system places a heavy burden on both the taxable person and the tax administration, the Danish authorities have requested authorisation to apply a special measure derogating from Article 75 of Directive 2006/112/EC. That measure would allow a taxable person, who has registered a vehicle as being for business purposes only, to use the vehicle for non-business purposes, and to calculate the taxable amount of the deemed supply pursuant to Article 75 of Directive 2006/112/EC on a daily flat rate basis, rather than lose their right to deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase cost of the vehicle.
(5) That simplified calculation method would, however, be limited to 20 days of non-business use for each calendar year, and the flat rate amount of VAT to be paid is fixed at DKK 40 for each day of non-business use. This amount has been determined by the Danish Government following an analysis of national statistics.
(6) The measure, which is to apply to light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes, would simplify the VAT obligations of taxable persons who make occasional non-business use of a vehicle registered for business purposes. However, it would remain possible for a taxable person to choose to register a light goods vehicle as being for both business and personal use. In so doing, the taxable person would lose the right to deduct the VAT on the purchase of the vehicle but would not be required to pay a daily charge for any private use.

By letter dated 15 March 2012, the Commission notified Denmark that it had all the information that it considered necessary to consider the request.\n\n((3)) Currently, pursuant to Directive 2006/112/EC, if a light goods vehicle with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes is registered with the Danish authorities as being used for business purposes only, the taxable person is authorised to deduct, in full, the input tax on the purchase and running costs of the vehicle. If such a vehicle is subsequently used for private purposes, the taxable person loses the right to deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase cost of the vehicle.\n\n((4)) Given that that system places a heavy burden on both the taxable person and the tax administration, the Danish authorities have requested authorisation to apply a special measure derogating from Article\xa075 of Directive 2006/112/EC. That measure would allow a taxable person, who has registered a vehicle as being for business purposes only, to use the vehicle for non-business purposes, and to calculate the taxable amount of the deemed supply pursuant to Article\xa075 of Directive 2006/112/EC on a daily flat rate basis, rather than lose their right to deduct the VAT incurred on the purchase cost of the vehicle.\n\n((5)) That simplified calculation method would, however, be limited to 20 days of non-business use for each calendar year, and the flat rate amount of VAT to be paid is fixed at DKK\xa040 for each day of non-business use. This amount has been determined by the Danish Government following an analysis of national statistics.\n\n((6)) The measure, which is to apply to light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised weight of up to three tonnes, would simplify the VAT obligations of taxable persons who make occasional non-business use of a vehicle registered for business purposes. However, it would remain possible for a taxable person to choose to register a light goods vehicle as being for both business and personal use. In so doing, the taxable person would lose the right to deduct the VAT on the purchase of the vehicle but would not be required to pay a daily charge for any private use.\n\n((7)) Putting in place a measure ensuring that taxable person who makes occasional non-business use of a vehicle registered for business purposes is not deprived in full of the right to deduct the input tax on that vehicle would be consistent with the general rules on deduction as laid down by Directive 2006/112/EC.\n\n((8)) The authorisation should be valid for a limited period and should therefore expire on 31\xa0December 2014. In light of the experience gained up to that date an assessment should be made whether or not the derogation remains justified.\n\n((9)) The measure will affect the overall amount of the tax revenue of the Member State concerned collected at the stage of final consumption only to a negligible extent, and has no negative impact on the Union’s own resources accruing from value added tax,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nBy derogation from Article\xa075 of Directive 2006/112/EC, where a taxable person uses for private purposes, or those of his staff, or more generally for purposes other than those of his business, a light goods vehicle which has been registered as being solely for business use, Denmark is authorised to determine the taxable amount by reference to a flat-rate for each day of such use.\nThe flat rate per day referred to in the first paragraph shall be DKK 40.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe measure referred to in Article\xa01 shall only be applied to light goods vehicles with a maximum authorised total weight of three tonnes.\nThis measure shall not apply where the non-business use exceeds 20 days per calendar year.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 December 2014.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.'}]}"

(1) Whereas according to the second subparagraph of Article 9 (1) of Directive 89/662/EEC and the second subparagraph of Article 10 (1) of Directive 90/425/EEC, the Member State of origin or dispatch is required to implement on its territory the appropriate measures to prevent all situations likely to constitute a serious hazard to animals or to human health;
(2) Whereas as a result of information on the appearance of cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United Kingdom a risk of transmission of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent to humans or other animals cannot be ruled out;
(3) Whereas Commission Decision 94/381/EC of 27 June 1994 concerning certain protection measures with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian derived protein (6), as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (7), prohibited the feeding of mammalian protein to ruminants throughout the Community;
(4) Whereas Commission Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (8), as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (9), was adopted pending further evaluation of the new information and further measures to protect animal and public health;
(5) Whereas Commission Decision 96/449/EC of 18 July 1996 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (10), lays down the best available method for processing animal waste as regards spongiform encephalopathy agents;
(6) Whereas a group of experts convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 3 April 1996 recommended that no part or product of any animal which had shown signs of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) should enter any food chain (human or animal), and that countries should not permit tissues that are likely to contain the BSE agent to enter any food chain (human or animal); whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has assessed the measures needed in the whole Community in order to implement the recommendations of the abovementioned group of experts;
(7) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has concluded that the rendering procedure using 133 Â°C at 3 bar for 20 minutes is the most important factor to assure the safety of meat-and-bone meal, but that this system cannot completely guarantee the complete removal of a TSE agent present in the material to be rendered if the system is challenged with material with high infectivity;
(8) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has stated that several Member States including the United Kingdom have reported scrapie in native-born sheep, that the presence of scrapie cannot be excluded in any Member State where sheep are present and that only a thorough epidemiological investigation conducted to common standards will give the necessary information about the scrapie status of each country;
(9) Whereas measures must be implemented in order to protect ruminants from scrapie pending a proper epidemiological evaluation of the situation in the Community;
(10) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has therefore recommended that specified risk materials, defined as brain, spinal cords and eyes from cattle, sheep and goats over one year of age and spleens from sheep and goats over six months of age, should be removed from all food and feed chains in countries or regions where a potential risk is identified, and that, in the case of fallen cattle, sheep and goats either the specified risk materials should be removed so that they do not enter any food or feed chain, or the whole carcase should be destroyed;
(11) Whereas it is necessary for practical reasons to exclude the use of spleens from sheep and goats, irrespective of age, and mechanically recovered meat from the vertebral column of cattle, sheep and goats;
(12) Whereas certain Member States have already excluded certain material from the food and feed chains; whereas the United Kingdom has prohibited tissues in addition to those recommended by the Scientific Veterinary Committee; whereas Article 3.2.13.12 of the Animal Health Code of the International Office of Epizootics recommends that bovine brains, eyes, spinal cord, tonsils, thymus, spleen and distal ileum (tissues under study) and protein products derived from them from cattle over six months of age originating from countries with a high incidence of BSE should not be traded between countries;
(13) Whereas the United Kingdom is considered to be a country with a high incidence of BSE; whereas the tissues included on the list of specified bovine materials of the United Kingdom are in conformity with the list of the abovementioned Article of the Animal Health Code; whereas, therefore, the United Kingdom should be authorized to keep the existing national measures in respect of the removal of specified bovine material in force;
(14) Whereas a risk analysis based on accepted scientific methodology may show that there is a significantly higher risk of exposure of animals or humans to TSEs in certain Member States; whereas those Member States may take action in respect of the removal of additional risk material of animals slaughtered on their territory;
(15) Whereas although the situation as regards TSEs may vary between Member States, uniform rules throughout the Community should be adopted in order to ensure a high level of health protection and to avoid distortion of trade;
(16) Whereas equivalent guarantees are required for imports from third countries; whereas the situation as regards TSEs may vary between countries and the import requirements may therefore be adapted to the particular situation of the country of origin;

(18) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision further contribute to the safe sourcing, processing and use of ruminant material for food, feed, medical and pharmaceutical products and cosmetic products;
(19) Whereas there are no effective controls or tests which can determine whether or not particular tissues have been used in the manufacturing of products; whereas, therefore, in order to ensure that the tissues and fluids in question have not been used in the manufacture of products which are marketed in the Community, it is essential to ensure that those tissues are removed and stained at the point of production, and subsequently destroyed by incineration, following rendering where necessary; whereas such measures will also ensure that those tissues are excluded from food, feed, medical and pharmaceutical products and cosmetic products;
(20) Whereas it is appropriate to provide for derogations to permit the use of materials covered by this Decision for teaching and research purposes and, under certain conditions, for feeding fur animals;
(21) Whereas the Council, at its meeting of 17 December 1996, rejected by a simple majority the Commission's proposal on removal of specified risk materials;
(22) Whereas inspections were carried out in Member States in 1996 to check the implementation of Community measures on BSE; whereas the results of those inspections are now available; whereas those inspections have revealed certain deficiencies, in particular in surveillance and implementation of the ban on use of mammalian protein in ruminant feed;
(23) Whereas in view of previous trade in certain products, in particular meat and bone meal and live animals, the possible presence of TSE agents cannot be ruled out in any of the Member States; whereas on the basis of the results of the inspections, no Member State can therefore be considered to be free from a potential risk from TSEs;
(24) Whereas this Decision will be reviewed in the light of new scientific information with regard to risk of exposure to TSEs resulting from infectivity in other animal species, age categories, tissues or materials, not yet covered by this Decision;
(25) Whereas the Commission will make proposals to set up an effective TSE surveillance in the Member States;
(26) Whereas the Standing Veterinary Committee has not delivered an opinion; whereas the Commission therefore proposed these measures to the Council on 17 July 1997 in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 89/662/EEC, the Council being required to adopt measures within 15 days;

Whereas:
(1) Article 22(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 provides, among other things, for reference prices valid for the Community to be fixed each year, by product category, for the products specified in Annexes I, II, III, IV(B) and V to that Regulation, subject to the consultation procedures laid down for certain products within the framework of the GATT.
(2) Article 23(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 provides, inter alia, for the fixing of reference prices for the products referred to in Annex IV(A) before the beginning of each marketing year.
(3) Article 22(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 provides that the reference price for the products specified in Annex I(A), (D) and (E) thereto must be equal, respectively, to the withdrawal and selling prices fixed in accordance with Article 11(1) and Article 13 thereof.
(4) The Community withdrawal and selling prices for the products concerned were fixed for the 2000 fishing year by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2802/1999(3).
(5) The reference prices for the products specified in Annexes I(B) and (C) and IV(B) to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 are determined on the basis of the average of the reference prices for the fresh product, account being taken of the processing costs and of the need to ensure a price relationship in keeping with the market situation.
(6) The reference prices for the products specified in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 must be derived from their guide prices, referred to in Article 9(1) of that Regulation, by reference to the price level at which the intervention measures provided for in Article 16(1) thereof may be taken, and fixed taking account of the situation on the market in those products.
(7) The reference prices for the fishes of the Thunnus and Euthynnus species specified in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 are based on the weighted average of the free-at-frontier prices recorded on the most representative markets in the Member States during the three preceding years.
(8) For the carp and salmon referred to in Annex IV(A) to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92, reference prices are fixed on the basis of the average of the producer prices recorded during the three years preceding the date on which the reference price is fixed for a product with commercial characteristics as set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2210/93(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 843/95(5).
(9) For the frozen and salted products specified in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 the reference price shall be determined on the basis of the average reference price for the fresh product, taking into account the processing costs and the market situation. If there is no reference price fixed for the fresh product, the reference prices are determined on the basis of the reference price applied to a commercially similar fresh product. However, given the quantities of certain frozen and salted products and the conditions governing their importation, it does not appear possible to fix a reference price for all of these products in the immediate future.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union's objective is to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the field of police and judicial cooperation.
(2) The conclusions of the Tampere European Council call for closer cooperation between the authorities responsible for combating crime.
(3) The Oisin programme, set up by Council Joint Action 97/12/JHA of 20 December 1996 providing a common programme for the exchange and training of, and cooperation between, law enforcement authorities (""Oisin"")(3), has helped step up cooperation between the Member States' law enforcement authorities.
(4) The renewal of the programme, expressly provided for by that Joint Action, would enable this cooperation to be improved, in particular by making full use of the operational benefits of the programme.
(5) It is desirable to ensure continuity for the projects supported by the Oisin programme and to renew the programme for a second phase of two years.
(6) The Oisin programme must be opened up further to the applicant countries by facilitating their participation in the projects supported by the programme.
(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with the procedures set out herein.
(8) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(4), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the EC-Treaty,","{'title': '2001/513/JHA: Council Decision of 28 June 2001 establishing a second phase of the programme of incentives, exchanges, training and cooperation for law enforcement authorities (Oisin II)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nEstablishment of the programme\n\n1.

of 29 December 2003
laying down rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2004 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules(1), and in particular Article 17(3) and (6) and Article 21(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 established quantitative restrictions on imports of certain textile products originating in certain third countries to be allocated on a ""first come, first served"" basis.
(2) Under that Regulation it is possible, in certain circumstances, to use other allocation methods, to divide quotas into tranches or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance.
(3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2004 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly.
(4) The measures adopted in previous years, such as those in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2357/2002 establishing rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2003 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94(2), proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2004.
(5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ""first come, first served"" allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method.
(6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration, operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2004 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2003.
(7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities, an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount, provided that quantities are available in the quotas.
(8) For the sake of sound administration, import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary that he/she has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should, however, be authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2005 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.
(9) Given that on 1 May 2004 the European Union will be enlarged, the allocation amongst importers of the 2004 quota should be divided into two tranches, corresponding to the Union's current and future membership respectively. Acceding States should be permitted to issue import authorisations only for goods to be imported on or after 1 May.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, Slovenia’s application to register the name ‘Kraški pršut’ was published in the Official Journal of the European Union

(2) Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, a statement of objection was sent to the Commission by Italy on 29 March 2010, substantiated under Article 7(3)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. In its letter dated 14 June 2010, the Commission invited the interested parties to hold appropriate consultations.
(3) An agreement, notified to the Commission on 9 November 2010, was reached between Slovenia and Italy within six months, containing amendments to the initial specification, specifically the removal of the reference to the village of Štanjel.
(4) This removal affects the defined geographical area and cannot therefore be regarded as a minor change.
(5) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 7(5) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Commission should once again perform the examination referred to in Article 6(1) of that Regulation.

Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), as last amended by  Directive 92/10/EEC (2), and in particular Article 14 (2) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Directive 77/93/EEC, potato tubers originating in the American continent may not, in principle, be brought into the Community unless their faculty of germination has been suppressed, in view of the risk of the introduction of potato  spindle tuber viroid, and unless - if they originate in a country where Corynebacterium sepedonicum is known to occur - provisions recognized as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating this harmful organism have been complied with in the  country of origin;
Whereas, nevertheless, Article 14 (1) (c) (iii) of Directive 77/93/EEC permits Member States to provide for derogations with regard to the rule relating to the suppression of the faculty of germination, provided that there is no risk of harmful  organisms spreading; whereas these derogations are subject to approval, under certain conditions, in accordance with Article 14 (2) and must also comply with the conditions laid down in Annex IV, part A (24);
Whereas in Greece, Italy and Portugal the growing of potatoes of certain North American varieties has been an established practice; whereas part of the supply of seed potatoes of these varieties has been ensured by imports from Canada;
Whereas, by Decisions 86/120/EEC (3), 87/154/EEC (4), as amended by Decision 87/311/EEC (5), 88/176/EEC (6), as amended by Decision 88/496/EEC (7), 89/32/EEC (8), and 89/599/EEC (9), as amended by Decision 91/592/EEC (10), the Commission approved  derogations based on the concept of 'areal freedom', subject to certain technical conditions to prevent the risk of harmful organisms spreading; whereas that approval expired on 31 March 1992; whereas the Commission also provided that those derogations  would provide for the opportunity to seek confirmation of the proper functioning of the concept of 'areal freedom';
Whereas Greece, Italy and Portugal have stated that they intend to provide for derogations for the next seed-potato marketing season;
Whereas it is known that Canada is still not free from potato spindle tuber viroid or from Corynebacterium sepedonicum;
Whereas Canada has further developed its programme to eradicate these harmful organisms in the provinces of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island; whereas there are good reasons to believe that the programme to eradicate potato spindle tuber viroid has  become fully effective in those provinces, and that the programme to eradicate Corynebacterium sepedonicum has become fully effective in certain areas of these provinces; whereas there have been no findings of the disease on samples drawn from seed  potatoes imported pursuant to Decision 91/592/EEC; whereas it has not been established that there are sufficient elements which would militate against the proper functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom' and therefore against the  recognition of the provisions implemented there as equivalent to the Community provisions on combating Corynebacterium sepedonicum;
Whereas it can therefore be established that there is no risk of the harmful organisms in question spreading, provided that the seed potatoes originate in areas declared, on scientific evidence, free from both potato spindle tuber viroid and from  Corynebacterium sepedonicum, and that certain improved special technical conditions are complied with; whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada makes all technical information available which is necessary to monitor the functioning of the  protective measures required under the aforementioned technical conditions and to assess the functioning of the aforementioned concept of 'areal freedom';
Whereas, therefore, the derogations provided for by Greece, Italy and Portugal should be approved for the next seed-potato marketing season, provided that they include the aforementioned conditions and without prejudice to Council Directive 66/403/EEC  (11), as last amended by Directive 92/17/EEC (12), and to Council Directive 70/457/EEC (13), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (14);

Monitoring and assessment of the programme during the implementation period (continuous monitoring and assessment)\n\n1. The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous monitoring and assessment of the programme.\n\n2. By continuous monitoring is meant an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realization.\n\n3. Continuous assessment of the programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives.\n\nImplementation report and scrutiny of the programme\n\n4. France shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final implementation report.\n\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\n\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission by 31 December 1998 at the latest and shall thereafter be presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health as soon as possible after that date.\n\n5. The Commission may jointly with France call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment referred to in point 3. He may submit proposals for adjusting the subprogrammes and/or measures and amending the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall give an opinion on administrative measures to be taken.\n\nC. Information and publicity\n\nIn the framework of this action, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicized.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n- make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\n\nFrance and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the monitoring committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the monitoring committee.\n\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\n\nII. COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES\n\nCommunity policies applying in this field must be complied with.\n\nThe programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and compliance with Community policies. The following information must be supplied by France.\n\n1. Award of public contracts\n\nThe 'public contracts` (3) questionnaire must be completed for:\n\n- public contracts above the ceilings set by the 'supplies` and 'works` directives that are awarded by contract-awarding authorities as defined in these directives and are not covered by the exemptions specified therein,\n\n- public contracts below these ceilings where they constitute components of a single piece of work or of uniform supplies of a value above the ceiling. By 'a single piece of work` is meant a product of building or civil engineering works intended in itself to fulfil an economic or technical function.\n\nThe thresholds will be those in force on the date of notification of this Decision.\n\n2. Protection of the environment\n\n(a) General information\n\n- description of the main environmental features and problems of the region concerned, giving, inter alia, a description of the important conservation areas (sensitive zones),\n\n- a comprehensive description of the major beneficial and harmful effects that the programme, given the investments planned, is likely to have on the environment,\n\n- a description of the action planned to prevent, reduce or offset any serious harmful effects on the environment,\n\n- a report on consultations with the responsible environmental authorities (opinion of the Ministry for the Environment or its equivalent) and, if there were any such consultations, with the public concerned.\n\n(b) Description of planned activities\n\nFor programme measures liable to have a significantly harmful effect on the environment:\n\n- the procedures which will be applied for assessing individual projects during implementation of the programme,\n\n- the mechanisms planned for monitoring environmental impact during implementation, assessing results and eliminating, reducing or offsetting harmful effects.\n\n(1) OJ L 26, 31. 1. 1977, p. 20.\n\n(2) OJ L 87, 2. 4. 1997, p. 17.\n\n(3) Commission notification to the Member States C (88) 2510 (OJ C 22, 28. 1. 1989, p. 3) on monitoring of compliance with public procurement rules in the projects and programmes financed by the structural funds and financial tools.""}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses(1), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 1999/41/EC(2), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee for Food,
Whereas:
(1) A number of nutritional substances such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids and others may be added to foods for particular nutritional uses in order to ensure that the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom those foods are intended are fulfilled and/or in order to satisfy legal requirements laid down in specific directives adopted pursuant to Article 4(1) of Directive 89/398/EEC.
(2) It is not possible to define nutritional substances as a distinct group for the purpose of this Directive nor to draw up at this stage an exhaustive list of all categories of nutritional substances that may be added in foods for particular nutritional uses.
(3) The range of foods for particular nutritional uses is very wide and diversified and the technological processes used for their manufacture are varied. For this reason, the widest possible choice of substances that can be safely used in the manufacture of foods for particular nutritional uses should be available for the categories of nutritional substances to be listed in this Directive.
(4) The choice of substances should be based primarily on their safety and subsequently on their availability for use by humans and their organoleptic and technological properties. The inclusion of substances in the list of those that may be used in the manufacture of foods for particular nutritional uses does not mean that their addition to those foods is necessary or desirable.
(5) Where the addition of a nutritional substance has been judged necessary, this has been stipulated by specific rules in the relevant specific directives together with the appropriate quantitative conditions, as the case may be.
(6) In the absence of any specific rules or in the case of foods for particular nutritional uses not covered by specific directives, nutritional substances should be used in order to manufacture products that are in conformity with the definition of such products and fulfil the particular nutritional requirements of the persons for whom they are intended. The products in question must also be safe when used as instructed by the manufacturer.
(7) The provisions concerning the list of the nutritional substances that may be used in the manufacture of infant formulae and follow-on formulae and of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children are laid down in Commission Directive 91/321/EEC of 14 May 1991 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae(3), as last amended by Directive 1999/50/EC(4), and Commission Directive 96/5/EC of 16 February 1996 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children(5), as last amended by Directive 1999/39/EC(6). Therefore those provisions need not be repeated in this Directive.
(8) A number of the nutritional substances may also be used in foodstuffs as food additives. In this context purity criteria have been or are to be adopted for them at Community level in accordance with Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption(7), as amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 94/34/EC(8). Those purity criteria should be applicable for those substances whatever the purpose of their use in foodstuffs.
(9) Pending the adoption of purity criteria for the rest of the substances at Community Ievel, and in order to ensure a high level of protection for public health, generally acceptable purity criteria recommended by international organisations or agencies including but not limited to the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), EUP (European Pharmacopoeia) should apply. Member States should be permitted to maintain national rules setting stricter purity criteria, without prejudice to the rules set out in the Treaty.
(10) Some specific nutrients or their derivatives have been identified as specifically necessary for the manufacture of some foods belonging to the group of foods for special medical purposes and their potential use should be reserved to the manufacture of these products.
(11) The measures provided in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2001/15/EC of 15 February 2001 on substances that may be added for specific nutritional purposes in foods for particular nutritional uses (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Without prejudice to European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 258/97(9), other substances added for specific nutritional purposes, not belonging to one of the categories listed in the Annex to this Directive, may be used in the manufacture of foods for particular nutritional uses.\n\n3.

The competent authorities of Member States, referred to in Article 9 of Directive 89/398/EEC, shall be empowered to require the manufacturer or, where appropriate, the importer to produce the scientific work and the data establishing the use of substances added for specific nutritional purposes in compliance with paragraph 3.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) The consultation of users and producers of statistical information as well as respondents to requests for such information is essential for the preparation and development of the Community’s statistical information policy.
(2) The European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres set up by Council Decision 91/116/EEC (3) currently assists the Council and the Commission in the coordination of the objectives of the Community’s statistical information policy, taking into account user requirements and the costs borne by information providers and producers.
(3) The European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres has been of use but changes that have taken place in the Community, in particular its enlargement to 27 Member States, require that a number of modifications be made to the role, mandate, composition and procedures of that Committee. In the interests of clarity, it is appropriate to replace that Committee by a new European Statistical Advisory Committee (the Committee).
(4) The Committee should contribute to a close cooperation in the programme-planning process in order to improve the governance of the European Statistical System and enhance the quality of Community statistics. To this effect, close collaboration should be maintained with the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (4) and with the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics established by Council Decision 91/115/EEC (5).
(5) A balance should be achieved between the need to reduce membership in order to enable the Committee to work efficiently in an enlarged Community on the one hand, and the need to allow representation of all stakeholders in Community statistics, as requested in the Council conclusions of 8 November 2005, on the other.
(6) In order to meet the objectives of better assessing and balancing the benefits and costs of Community statistical requirements and rebalancing and reducing the burden of Community statistical legislation, so facilitating compliance with increasing demand, the Committee should play a stronger role in preparing and implementing the Community statistical programme.
(7) The Committee should serve as a channel for advice from users, respondents and producers of statistical information on the objectives of the Community’s statistical information policy.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 867/90 (3) extends the common measures to forestry products;
Whereas on 25 April 1994 the Danish Government submitted to the Commission the Single Programming Document referred to in Article 10 (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 866/90, supplemented by additional information sent on 24 June and 5 October 1994; whereas  that document contains the plans designed to improve the structures relating to the various product sectors referred to in Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 866/90 and the aid applications referred to in Article 10 (a) of that Regulation;
Whereas the Single Programming Document meets the Commission conditions of and contains the information required in Article 1 (3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 860/94 of 18 April 1994 on plans and applications, in the form of operational programmes,  for aid from the Guidance Section of the EAGGF for investments for improving the processing and marketing conditions for agricultural and forestry products (4);
Whereas the Single Programming Document was drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned under the partnership as defined in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their  effectiveness and on coordination of activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (6);
Whereas the second indent of Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purposes of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 402/94 (8),  provides that in Commission decisions approving Single Programming Documents, the Community assistance decided upon for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof are to be set out in ecus, at prices for the year in which the decision is taken,  and are to be subject to indexation; whereas the annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in commitment appropriations as set out in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as amended; whereas the indexation is to be based on a  single rate per year corresponding to the rates applied annually to the Community budget on the basis of the mechanisms for technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (9), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (10), provides that the legal commitments entered into for  measures extending over more than one financial year are to contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2707/72 (3) lays down the conditions for applying protective measures for fruit and vegetables;

Whereas on 19 May 1995 the Kingdom of Spain requested the Commission to take protective measures against imports of garlic;
Whereas in 1993 the Commission recorded a very sharp rise in imports of garlic originating in China as compared with preceding years; whereas, given their price, further imports could have brought about such serious disturbance of the Community market as to jeopardize the objectives of Article 39 of the EC Treaty and in particular to damage Community producers; whereas the Commission accordingly adopted a protective measure by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1213/94 of 27 May 1994 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2815/94 (7), to limit the quantity covered by import licences issued for garlic originating in China for the 1994/95 marketing year to a given quantity per month;
Whereas each month import licence applications in respect of garlic originating in China have covered quantities far exceeding the monthly quantity fixed by Regulation (EEC) No 1213/94; whereas, moreover, the number of applications submitted on the first day of each monthly period led throughout the whole marketing year concerned to import licences being issued for quantities generally equal to less than 1 % of the quantities applied for and to the rejection of applications submitted thereafter; whereas this systematic overrun shows that there is continuing pressure on the market for this product and that, unless protective measures are adopted, the Community market in garlic could be seriously disturbed by huge quantities imported from China; whereas it is therefore vital for the protective measure applying to garlic originating in China to be renewed;

of 5 July 1989
approving aid from Belgium to the coal industry during 1989
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(89/529/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1),
Whereas:
I
In its letter of 21 November 1988 the Belgian Government informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2046/86/ECSC, of the financial measures it intends to take during 1989 in order to give direct support to the coal industry.
In its letter of 7 April 1989 the Belgian Government sent further information, as requested by the Commission on 23 February 1989.
Under the abovementioned Decision, the Commission must give a ruling on the following financial measures:
- aid totalling Bfrs 6 709 200 000 to cover operating losses, pursuant to Article 3 of the said Decision,
- aid totalling Bfrs 223 300 000 to sales of coal and coke to the iron and steel industry of the Community, pursuant to Article 4 of the said Decision,
- aid totalling Bfrs 2 400 000 for staff training, pursuant to Article 6 of the said Decision.
According to the information supplied by the Belgian Government, the measures notified are intended to help implement the restructuring plan for the firm Kempense Steenkolenmijnen.
The measures which the Belgian Government intends to take to support the coal industry comply with the provisions of Article 1 (1) of the said Decision. The Commission must therefore give a ruling, under Article 10 of this Decision, as to whether they comply with the objectives and criteria set out in that Decision and whether they are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
II
Coal production is not economically viable in the long term, so that a restructuring plan was needed. Since this plan was introduced in 1987, production capacity has been halved. At the end of 1988 it amounted to three million tonnes, following the early closure of three of the five collieries.
The amount of aid linked to current production is thus about 45 % down on the 1986 figure.
The decreasing levels of aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant, their temporary nature and the implementation of a clearly defined restructuring plan are in accordance with the conditions laid down for the application of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
The aid to cover operating losses is aimed at facilitating the implementation of the restructuring programme for the Campine coalfield, as decided by ministerial decree in January 1987. In accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision, this contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry.
In accordance with Article 12 of the Decision, coal undertakings shall be authorized, where necessary, to grant rebates on their list prices or production costs, for deliveries of coking coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community under long-term contract; these rebates must not cause the delivered prices of Community coal and coke to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke made from non-member country coking coal.
According to the Belgian Government, the aid to sales of coking coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community, totalling Bfrs 223 300 000, will make up the difference between world market prices and production costs for 95 000 tonnes. The aid therefore conforms to Article 4 of the Decision.
The sales aid for supplies of coal, blast-furnace coke and coal for injection into blast-furnaces for the iron and steel industry of the Community forms part of the restructuring programme. In accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision, this contributes to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry.
The aid granted to maintain a qualified workforce of underground staff is a long-standing specific measure which is conducted separately from the aid pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the Decision. The aid therefore conforms to Article 6 of the Decision.
The object of the measure is to maintain a skilled workforce, as part of the restructuring programme for the industry.
In view of the transitional nature of the aid, its phased reduction and its inclusion in the restructuring programme, it complies with the objectives and conditions laid down in Article 2 of the Decision.
Therefore the aid to be granted by the Belgian Government to the coal industry in 1989 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
This Decision is without prejudice to the compatibility with the Treaties of the rules governing sales of Belgian coal to electricity producers.
Pursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof. The Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '89/529/ECSC: Commission Decision of 5 July 1989 approving aid from Belgium to the coal industry during 1989 (only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBelgium is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Bfrs 6 934 900 000 to the Belgian coal industry for the 1989 calendar year.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. Tefluthrin is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (4) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included tefluthrin.
(3) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (6) the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from entry into force of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (7) was adopted on the non-inclusion of tefluthrin.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I.
(5) The application was submitted to Germany, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) Germany evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 9 December 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on tefluthrin to the Commission on 20 August 2010 (8). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for tefluthrin.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing tefluthrin may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve tefluthrin in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that tefluthrin should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the approval.
(11) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing tefluthrin. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(12) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (9) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (10) should be amended accordingly.
(14) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of tefluthrin and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning tefluthrin in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
I. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) In Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 (2), the Council imposed in particular a definitive anti-dumping duty of 21,9 % on imports of VHS video tape in cassettes falling within CN code ex 8523 13 00 originating in Hong Kong, with the exception of imports  from several exporters specifically mentioned which were subject to a lesser rate of duty or no duty at all.
(2) In recital 43 of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89, with regard to the problem of companies which started or will start exporting own-produced video cassettes to the Community after the investigation period (newcomers), the Council noted that the  Commission was ready to initiate without delay a review proceeding whenever the exporting company could show the Commission, and supply to that effect sufficient evidence, that it did not export the products concerned to the Community during the period  of investigation. The company also had to demonstrate that it only started those exports after the said period and that it was not related to or associated with any of the companies subject to the investigation.
II. REVIEW PROCEDURE
(3) By a notice published on 11 January 1991 (3) the Commission, after consultation with the Advisory Committee and in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 initiated a review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 with regard to a Hong Kong  company, Wai Shing. This company had submitted that it did not export the products subject to the anti-dumping duty during the previous period of investigation (1 January - 30 November 1987). In addition, it submitted that it was not related to any of  the companies subject to the previous investigation for which dumping was found and provided substantiated evidence that it had just begun to export video cassettes to the Community. Accordingly, the Commission commenced an investigation in order to  verify whether Wai Shing could be considered as a newcomer and to establish a dumping margin, if any, for that company.
III. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. Newcomer
(4) The investigation showed that Wai Shing began to export own-produced video cassettes to the Community after the previous investigation period mentioned in recital 3. In addition, it was found that this company had no link of any sort with the  exporters involved in the previous procedure and for which dumping was found. The Council confirms that it should accordingly be considered as a newcomer and that a partial review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 with regard to Wai Shing was warranted.
2. Normal value
(5) Since Wai Shing did not sell any video cassettes on the domestic market during the investigation period for this review, normal value was determined on the basis of the constructed value of the models concerned in accordance with Article 2 (3) (b)  of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. This constructed value was computed on the basis of all costs, both fixed and variable, in the country of origin, of materials and manufacture for the models exported to the Community plus a reasonable amount for selling,  administrative, other general expenses and profit.
(6) As far as selling, administrative and general expenses were concerned, they were calculated by reference to such expenses incurred by another Hong Kong manufacturer for its sales of video cassettes on the domestic market, since it was verified that  these expenses corresponded to such costs as entered in the audited accounts of Wai Shing.
As far as profit was concerned, it was found appropriate to apply a profit rate of 8 % on turnover; this rate was used in Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 for the Hong Kong exporters and, according to the information available to the Commission, can still be  regarded as the profit that Hong Kong companies can normally achieve on their domestic market. The Council confirms the foregoing findings.
(7) On this basis, normal value was established for the models exported to the Community and for the three qualities of tapes used by Wai Shing, namely normal grade, high grade and super high grade.
3. Export price
(8) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices, net of all rebates, actually paid or payable for the video cassettes sold for export by Wai Shing to the Community. Indeed, since exports were made directly to independent importers in the  Community, these export prices were found to be reliable.
The Council confirms this finding.
4. Comparison
(9) For the purpose of a fair comparison between normal value and export price, the Commission took account of differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2 (9) and (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. All comparisons were made  at ex-works level, at the same level of trade and, for the export price, on a transaction by transaction basis.
The examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which normal value exceeds the price for export to the Community, which, as expressed as a percentage of total cif value, was 13,8 %.
The Council confirms the above findings.
IV. AMENDMENT OF THE REVIEWED MEASURES
(10) No new investigation was carried out as regards injury since this was not requested. In addition, the Commission considers that the injury findings established in Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 are still valid. Therefore, since the price increase  which would be required to eliminate the injury level exceeds the dumping margin found for the company concerned, as established in Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 (recital 71), the duty to be imposed should correspond to the dumping margin.
(11) The complainants and Wai Shing were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose the replacement of the duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 in respect of Wai Shing by an anti-dumping  duty established on the basis of the above and were given every opportunity to comment. After this disclosure, Wai Shing offered a price undertaking.
However, in the light of the economic structure of the exporter, in particular the fact that it supplies and exports to the Community video cassettes of various origins, and given the evolution of the trade flows for this product from Hong Kong, the  monitoring of such undertaking would not be manageable. Therefore, the Commission considered, after consultation, that the undertaking offer submitted by Wai Shing was not acceptable.
(12) In addition, the Commission found that the prices of video cassettes originating in Hong Kong were subject to a high degree of volatility. Commission thus considered that, for the models investigated, the duty should take the form of a variable  duty equal to the difference between price per cassette net, free-at-Community-frontier, not cleared through customs, and a floor price established on the basis of the normal value for each individual model. Since it cannot be excluded that the exporter  will also export models which were not covered by the investigation, it appears appropriate to establish an ad valorem duty at the level of the dumping margin found for all other video cassettes exported to the Community by this company. The Council  confirms the above findings.
(13) Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 should be amended in respect of Wai Shing and that, until the Regulation's expiry, a definitive anti-dumping duty shall be imposed on VHS video tapes in cassettes  manufactured by Wai Shing and originating in Hong Kong in respect of the models E-30, E-60, E-90, E-120, E-180, E-195 and E-240, whether normal grade, or high grade or super high grade. This duty shall be equal to the difference between a floor price  based on this normal value and their net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, payable by the first importer. All other models of video cassettes manufactured by Wai Shing and originating in Hong Kong shall be subject to a duty of 13,8 % ad  valorem,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1292/92 of 18 May 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 with regard to a definitive anti- dumping duty on imports of video cassettes originating in Hong Kong', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe following subparagraph shall be added to Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89:\n\n'The duty specified in paragraph 2 (b) shall not apply to models of video tape in cassettes E-30, E-60, E-90, E-120, E-180, E-195 and E-240 in quality normal grade (NG), high grade (HG) or super high grade (SHG) as specified hereafter and manufactured  and sold for export to the Community by Wai Shing (Hong Kong) (Taric additional Code 8255); these models shall instead be subject to a duty equal to the difference between the price mentioned hereunder for each of the models concerned and their net,  free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty:\n\nEcu  Additional Taric Code      E30 SHG  0,55  8626  E60 SHG\n\nHG  0,68\n\n0,66  8627\n\n8628  E90 SHG  0,81  8629  E120 SHG\n\nHG  0,94\n\n0,85  8630\n\n8631  E180 SHG\n\nHG\n\nNG  1,20\n\n1,13\n\n1,10  8632\n\n8633\n\n8634  E195 SHG\n\nHG  1,27\n\n1,20  8635\n\n8636  E240 SHG\n\nHG  1,47\n\n1,36  8637\n\n8638\n\nFor all other video tapes in cassettes produced by Wai Shing the duty shall be 13,8 % of their net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty.'""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 18 June 2013
on setting up the Commission expert group on cloud computing contracts
2013/C 174/04
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Whereas:
(1) On 27 September 2012, the Commission adopted a Communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Social and Economic Committee and the Committee of the Regions on ‘Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe’ (1). In the Communication the Commission underlines its aim of enabling and facilitating faster adoption of cloud computing throughout all sectors of the economy which can cut costs of information and communication technologies, and when combined with new digital business practices, can boost productivity, growth and jobs.
(2) Among other actions announced in the Communication, the Commission intends to work towards safe and fair contract terms and conditions for cloud computing contracts. This work responds to stakeholder concerns relating to cloud computing contracts. On the one hand, providers of cloud computing services indicated that the complexity and uncertainty relating to the existing legal framework make cross-border activity more difficult. On the other hand, although existing Union legislation protects consumers using cloud computing services, consumers are often unaware of their rights and are not informed by the provider in a sufficiently clear and unambiguous manner about the contractual conditions. Furthermore, representatives of consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises indicated that vague and unbalanced cloud computing contracts make them reluctant to take up cloud computing services. The Commission also intends to work on personal data protection aspects relevant to cloud computing contracts.
(3) User concerns relate among others to issues in cloud computing contracts such as direct and indirect liability and its possible limitations for instance for security breaches, data integrity, confidentiality or service continuity, remedies for service failures such as downtime or loss of data, unilateral modifications of the contract made by the provider after the conclusion of the contract, termination of the contract and its effects, including the issue of data preservation.
(4) The Commission intends to facilitate an improvement of the contractual arrangements between cloud computing service providers and consumers and small firms. The intended outcome is to build trust and facilitate the uptake and development of cloud computing services in the Union, considering their significant economic potential. It also intends to facilitate the application of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (2) to the extent that it is relevant to cloud computing contracts.
(5) The Commission intends to facilitate stakeholder agreement promoting the use of safe and fair terms and conditions in cloud computing contracts between cloud computing service providers and consumers and small firms. The Commission should work towards this goal with the active involvement of stakeholders drawing on their expertise and experience in the cloud computing sector. For this purpose, the Commission considers it appropriate to set up a group of experts on cloud computing contracts between cloud computing service providers and consumers and small firms. The tasks of the group shall be complementary to the work of the Commission on model terms for cloud computing service level agreements for contracts between cloud providers and professional users.
(6) The Commission has already addressed contract law-related problems which affect the confidence of consumers and businesses in the digital single market by the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Common European Sales Law (3). The proposal includes rules on the supply of ‘digital content’, which cover some aspects of cloud computing. The group should help to carry out complementary work on safe and fair contract terms and conditions for consumers and small firms for those cloud-related issues that lie beyond the scope of the Common European Sales Law.
(7) The group should include stakeholders, practitioners and organisations representing cloud services providers and customers, in particular consumers and small firms as well as representatives of legal professions or academics who have expertise in cloud computing contracts and in personal data protection aspects relevant to cloud computing contracts. The group may also include a limited number of specialists in the area of cloud computing contract law acting in their personal capacity. It should help identify best practices relating to cloud computing contracts and work towards ensuring that terms and conditions in cloud computing contracts are safe and fair.
(8) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group of experts should be laid down.
(9) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data.
(10) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension,",{'header': '20.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 174/6'}

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the prices at which preserved cultivated mushrooms are offered in the main supplier countries are substantially lower than the cost price of the Community industry and the quantities available in those countries are such that they are liable to disturb the Community market;
Whereas, confronted with this situation, the Commission has, on several occasions since 1978, had to take protective measures with regard to imports of preserved cultivated mushrooms;
Whereas it appears that this state of affairs is not likely to change in the near future and that the protective measures which have been taken do not, in themselves, constitute the most suitable means of remedying the situation;
Whereas provision should therefore be made for measures of market management consisting in the levying of an additional amount on all imports into the Community exceeding the quantities traditionally traded;
Whereas in view of the characteristics of third countries' supplies to the Community, its market may be protected by fixing the additional amount at a level corresponding approximately to that of the costs of production in the Community;
Whereas, given the very small volume of imports of products originating in the Maghreb countries and the ACP States and the preferential treatment which the Community offers those countries and States, no additional amount should be levied on those imports,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81 of 30 June 1981 on measures applicable to imports of preserved cultivated mushrooms', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nEvery entry into free circulation in the Community of preserved cultivated mushrooms falling within subheading ex 20.02 A of the Common Customs Tariff, other than that referred to in Article 4, shall be subject to the levying of an additional amount for the quantity in excess of that laid down in Article 3.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

REGULATION (EU) No 1342/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 13 December 2011
amending Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 as regards the inclusion of the Kaliningrad oblast and certain Polish administrative districts in the eligible border area
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular point (b) of Article 77(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) Union rules on local border traffic, established by Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 laying down rules on local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States and amending the provisions of the Schengen Convention (2), in force since 2007, have avoided creating barriers to trade, to social and cultural interchange or to regional cooperation with neighbouring countries, while preserving the security of the entire Schengen area.
(2) The Kaliningrad oblast has an exceptional geographic situation: as a relatively small area completely surrounded by two Member States, it constitutes the only enclave in the European Union; its shape and the distribution of its population are such that applying the standard rules on the definition of the border area would artificially divide the enclave, whereby some inhabitants would enjoy facilitations for local border traffic while the majority, including the inhabitants of the city of Kaliningrad, would not. In the light of the homogeneous nature of the Kaliningrad oblast, for trade, social and cultural interchange and regional cooperation to be enhanced, a specific exception to Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 should be introduced that would allow the entire Kaliningrad oblast to be considered as a border area.
(3) A specific border area on the Polish side should also be recognised as an eligible border area, in order for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006 in that region to have real effect through increased opportunities for trade, social and cultural interchange and regional cooperation between the Kaliningrad oblast on the one hand and major centres in the North of Poland on the other.
(4) This Regulation is without prejudice to the general definition of the border area and to full respect for the rules and conditions set out in Regulation (EC) No 1931/2006, including the penalties to be imposed by Member States on border residents who abuse the local border traffic regime.
(5) This Regulation contributes to further promoting the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Russian Federation, in line with the priorities set out in the Roadmap of the Common Space on Freedom, Security and Justice, and takes into account the overall relationship between the European Union and the Russian Federation.
(6) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the inclusion of the Kaliningrad oblast and certain Polish administrative districts in the eligible border area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.
(7) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters’ association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (3) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (4).
(8) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (5) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (6).
(9) As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (7) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2011/350/EU (8).
(10) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of 6 months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(11) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (9); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(12) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 70/524/EEC provides that no additive may be put into circulation unless a Community authorisation has been granted.
(2) Article 3a of Directive 70/524 lays down the requirements for Community authorisation of an additive in feedingstuffs.
(3) The use of the enzyme 3-phytase produced by Aspergillus niger (CBS 114.94) is already authorised without a time limit for the animal categories piglets, pigs for fattening, sows, chickens for fattening and laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1353/2000(3).
(4) This additive was provisionally authorised for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/98(4).
(5) New data were submitted by the producing company in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of this additive for turkeys for fattening in June 2003.
(6) The assessment of this application for authorisation in respect of the use of this additive for turkeys for fattening shows that the conditions provided for in Directive 70/524/EEC for authorisation without time limit are satisfied.
(7) The use of this additive for turkeys should therefore be authorised without a time limit.
(8) The assessment of the application shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additive set out in the Annex. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(1), as last amended by Directive 97/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98(3) laid down the compulsory indication on the labelling of foods and food ingredients produced from genetically modified soya (Glycine max L.) covered by Commission Decision 96/281/EC(4) and genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) covered by Commission Decision 97/98/EC(5), of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 79/112/EEC;
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 acknowledged that adventitious contamination of foodstuffs with DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification cannot be excluded;
(3) consequently, the Council, at the moment of adopting Council Regulation (EC) No 1139/98, invited the Commission to study the practicality of setting up de minimis thresholds for the presence of DNA or protein resulting from genetic modification in order to take account of the problem of adventitious contamination;
(4) despite the fact that some operators avoid using genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) or maize (Zea mays L.) or produce thereof as a source for their food ingredients, material derived from the said genetically modified organisms may be present in them as a result of adventitious contamination during e.g., cultivation, harvest, transport, storage and processing;
(5) in the cases in which the presence of such material is adventitious and represents only a small proportion of a food ingredient considered, this food ingredient should not be subject to the labelling requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1139/98;
(6) in order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to establish a de minimis threshold for the adventitious presence in food ingredients of material derived from the abovementioned genetically modified soya and maize;
(7) for the purpose of clarity, it is appropriate to fix a threshold in terms of a single percentage value;
(8) the value of 1 % best serves the purpose of establishing a tolerance level which simultaneously remains low and takes into account the necessary feasibility along the production chain. Detection methods already provide or shortly will, the necessary tools to implement this value. Nonetheless the 1 % value is to be seen as a maximum, and operators should therefore aim at achieving the lowest possible level of adventitious presence of the said material in practice;
(9) it is appropriate to clarify that the 1 % value should be the tolerance level not only for the adventitious presence of material derived from the abovementioned genetically modified organisms, but for the combined adventitious presence of such material and any other material placed on the market pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258/97(6) derived from other genetically modified organisms;
(10) the notion of material derived from the genetically modified organisms should be understood as referring to the part of each ingredient that is derived from the genetically modified organisms;
(11) in order to establish that the presence of this material is adventitious, operators must be in a position to supply evidence to satisfy competent authorities that they have taken appropriate steps to avoid using as a source genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) or maize (Zea mays L.), or any other additional genetically modified organisms whose derived material has been placed on the market pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 258/97, or produce thereof;
(12) for the purposes of consistency with Directive 79/112/EEC, it is appropriate to apply the threshold at the level of food ingredients individually considered;
(13) it should be clarified that the same approach is to be followed for the purpose of establishing a list of food ingredients not subject to the labelling requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 because of the absence of protein and DNA resulting from the genetic modification as specified in its Article 1(1);
(14) in any case, food ingredients are not subject to the labelling requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1139/98 when neither protein nor DNA resulting from the genetic modification as specified in Article 1(1) is present. In this light, it is appropriate to clarify that such list is not exhaustive;
(15) in some cases foods comprise a single ingredient. It is therefore necessary to bring clarity as to how these foods should be considered for the purposes of establishing the abovementioned list and for the application of the threshold;
(16) Directive 79/112/EEC applies to products which are delivered as such not only to the ultimate consumer, but also to mass caterers;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species [1], as last amended by Council Directive 79/967/EEC of 12 November 1979 [2], and in particular Article 15 (2) (3) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to the application lodged by the French Republic,
Whereas under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive, seeds or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been offically accepted during 1977 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, with effect from 31 December 1979, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of the said Directive provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the French Republic has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species;
Whereas the varieties of maize concerned have not been the subject of official growing trials in the French Republic in view of the French application;
Whereas these varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index of 700 or over; whereas it is well known that the varieties of maize which have an FAO maturity class index of 700 or over are not yet suitable for cultivation in the French Republic (second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the above Directive);
Whereas Commission Decision 77/282/EEC [3] extended the period provided for in the said Article 15 (1) for the variety Oberweihst (cocksfoot) for the French Republic from 31 March 1977 to 31 December 1979;
Whereas the Commission completed its examination of the French application in respect of this variety before the expiry of the said period;
Whereas, for this variety, the results of the trials show that it does not produce results in the French Republic which, with respect to their resistance to harmful organisms, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (first subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive), although in certain circumstances this is compensated by other superior characteristics (second sentence of Article 5 (4) of the said Directive);
Whereas, therefore, the application by the French Republic in respect of seeds of all these varieties should be granted; whereas, however, the authorization for the variety of cocksfoot concerned may not be applied in all cases;
Whereas the cases of other varieties are now being carefully examined by the Commission;
Whereas in respect of the varieties Aled and Grassland's Pawera (red clover) the French Republic has not yet been able, for reasons in part beyond its control, to justify its application;
Whereas the time limit specified in Article 15 (1) of the abovementioned Directive should therefore, where the French Republic is concerned, be extended for an appropriate period to allow it to prepare the necessary information on these varieties (Article 15 (7) of the above Directive);
Whereas it is impossible to complete examination of the variety Bosquet (barley) before the time limit specified in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive;
Whereas the time limit in question shall therefore, where the French Republic is concerned, be extended for an appropriate period in order to allow complete examination of the application in respect of this variety (Article 15 (7) of the above Directive);

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 of 22 May 2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea (1), and in particular Article 21 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Member States have submitted to the Commission their fisheries control programme for 2012, in accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, inclusive of the applications for a Union financial contribution towards the expenditure to be incurred in carrying out the projects contained in such programme.
(2) Applications concerning actions listed in Article 8(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 may qualify for Union funding.
(3) The applications for Union funding have been assessed with regard to their compliance with the rules set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 391/2007 (2).
(4) It is appropriate to fix the maximum amounts and the rate of the Union financial contribution within the limits set by Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 and to lay down the conditions under which such contribution may be granted.
(5) In conformity with Article 21(2) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, Member States have been asked to submit programs related to funding in the priority areas defined by the Commission in its letter of 14 October 2011, i.e. traceability, validation and cross-checking of data, measurement of engine power, equipment of small scale fleet with Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and Electronic Recording and Reporting Systems (ERS).
(6) On that basis and given budgetary constraints, requests in the programs for Union funding related to non-priority actions such as installation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on board fishing vessels, training and initiatives raising awareness of CFP rules as well as the purchase or modernisation of fisheries patrol vessels and aircraft were rejected.
(7) In order to encourage investment in the priority actions defined by the Commission and in view of the negative impact of the financial crisis on Member States’ budgets, expenditure related to the abovementioned priority areas and retained for this financing decision should benefit from a high co-financing rate, within the limits laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006.
(8) Within the priority areas defined by the Commission, it appeared that projects on traceability that were presented by Member States required a global and coordinated approach among Member States to be put in place before a Union contribution could be granted. The assessment of these traceability projects for a Union contribution was consequently postponed to an additional financing decision to be prepared in 2012.

(1) Under Point A(3) of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide levels of wine may be increased where climatic conditions have made this necessary.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 (2) lays down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine in particular.

of 17 September 2014
on recognition of the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria under Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
(2014/667/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC (1), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (2), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(4) The request to recognise that the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was first submitted to the Commission on 16 May 2011. The updated version of the scheme version was submitted on 7 February 2014. The scheme operates in the United Kingdom and can cover feed ingredients and compound feeds as well as combinable crops. This scheme covers the trading, transport and storage stages of agricultural feedstock from farm gate to first processor and, for the other stages, relies on other voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission. As such, it is the responsibility of the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ to ensure that the recognition issued by the Commission on those schemes with which it jointly operates remains valid during the length of cooperation.

Articles 7b and 7c and Annex\xa0IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.\n\n((2)) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.\n\n((3)) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.\n\n((4)) The request to recognise that the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was first submitted to the Commission on 16 May 2011. The updated version of the scheme version was submitted on 7\xa0February 2014. The scheme operates in the United Kingdom and can cover feed ingredients and compound feeds as well as combinable crops. This scheme covers the trading, transport and storage stages of agricultural feedstock from farm gate to first processor and, for the other stages, relies on other voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission. As such, it is the responsibility of the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ to ensure that the recognition issued by the Commission on those schemes with which it jointly operates remains valid during the length of cooperation. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.\n\n((5)) Assessment of the ‘Universal Feed Assurance Scheme’ scheme found it to cover adequately all the sustainability criteria of Directive 98/70/EC and of Directive 2009/28/EC, except Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC.

Whereas on 16 July 1974 the Belgian Government notified, pursuant to Article 17 (4) of Directive No 72/159/EEC and to Article 8 (4) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, the following provisions:    - Royal Decree of 21 June 1974 on the modernization of farms,

Whereas the objective of Directive No 72/159/EEC is to encourage the creation and development of farms which are capable through the adoption of rational methods of production of ensuring that persons working on them have an income comparable to that received for non-agricultural work and enjoy acceptable working conditions;
Whereas Directive No 72/159/EEC accordingly requires the Member States to introduce selective incentives to farmers who produce a farm development plan showing that on completion of the development period the farm will be capable of attaining as a minimum, for at least one non-work unit, a level of earned income from agricultural production comparable to that received for non-agricultural work;

Whereas the objective of Directive No 72/160/EEC is to make sufficient vacant land available for the formation of farms of appropriate size and structure as provided in Article 4 of Council Directive No 72/159/EEC on the modernization of farms;
Whereas to achieve this objective Member States are consequently required:    - under Article 2 (1) (a) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant annuities to farmers aged between 55 and 65, practising farming as their main occupation, who cease farming,
- under Article 2 (1) (b) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant farmers premiums, such premiums not to be eligible for assistance and to be calculated by reference to the utilized agricultural area released,
- under Article 2 (1) (c) of Directive No 72/160/EEC, to grant annuities to permanent  (1)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 1. (2)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 9.

Whereas Member States may vary the amount of an annuity or premium, or refuse to grant the same, on the ground of the age and/or means of a prospective beneficiary;

amending Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 imposing provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of urea originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania and the Ukraine, accepting an undertaking offered by the exporting producer in Bulgaria and terminating the proceeding as regards imports of urea originating from Egypt and Poland
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 21 October 2000, by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding (2) in respect of imports of urea (the product concerned) originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Egypt, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and the Ukraine.
(2) This proceeding resulted in provisional anti-dumping duties being imposed in July 2001 on imports of urea originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania and the Ukraine and a termination of the proceeding concerning imports of urea originating from Egypt and Poland by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 (3).
(3) In the same Regulation, the Commission accepted an undertaking offered by the exporting producer in Bulgaria, Chimco AD. Subject to the conditions set out in Regulation (EC) 1497/2001, imports of the product concerned into the Community from this company were exempted from the said provisional anti-dumping duties, pursuant to Article 3(1) of the same Regulation.
(4) Definitive duties were later imposed on imports of goods originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania and the Ukraine by Council Regulation (EC) No 92/2002 (4) (the definitive Regulation). Subject to the conditions set out therein, this Regulation also granted goods produced and directly exported to the first independent customer in the Community by Chimco AD an exemption to the payment of the definitive anti-dumping duties as an undertaking had already been accepted definitively from this company at the provisional stage of the proceeding. As mentioned in recital 137 of the definitive Regulation, the minimum price of the undertaking was adapted due to a change in the injury elimination level.
B.   BREACHES OF THE UNDERTAKING
1.   Obligations of the company with an undertaking
(5) The undertaking offered by Chimco AD obliges the company concerned, inter alia, to export the product concerned to the Community at or above certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) specified therein. This minimum price level has to be respected on a quarterly weighted average. The company also undertakes not to circumvent the undertaking by making compensatory arrangements with any other party.
(6) Furthermore, in order to allow effective monitoring of the undertaking, Chimco AD is obliged to send to the European Commission a quarterly report of all of its exports sales of the product concerned to the European Community. These reports should include details of all invoices issued during the period for sales made under the terms of the undertaking for which exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought. The data submitted in these sales reports should be complete and correct in all particulars.
(7) It is stipulated in the undertaking that the European Commission may give further technical instructions for the monitoring of this undertaking and that the company undertakes to cooperate in providing all information considered necessary by the European Commission for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this undertaking.
2.   Breaches of the undertaking
(8) The company was informed in December 2003 by the European Commission that a new system would be made available for the company to report the quarterly sales reports to the European Union. This system would be used for the reports from 2004 onwards if the company agreed to it.
(9) In return, the company sent an acceptance declaration of the new reporting system for undertakings and continued offer of an undertaking. Further, the two first reports under the new system have been correctly transmitted to the European Commission.
(10) Reports for the third and fourth quarter have not been received within the framework of the reporting system. The company was informed about this and was granted a sufficient period to remedy this situation. No reaction was received from the company.
(11) Further the company no longer sent any quarterly sales reports for 2005 to the European Commission. The obligation of the company to report their sales to the European Union was therefore not met.
(12) The failure to report in conformity to the technical specifications as well as the non-transmission of the quarterly reports constituted a breach of the undertaking. The company was therefore informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking and to recommend the imposition of the definitive anti-dumping duty. No reaction was received from the company, which is now under a bankruptcy procedure.
C.   AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1497/2001
(13) In the light of the above, Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 accepting an undertaking from Chimco AD should be deleted and Articles 4 and 5 of that Regulation should be renumbered accordingly,","{'header': '20.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 333/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2082/2005\nof 19 December 2005\namending Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 imposing provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of urea originating in Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Libya, Lithuania, Romania and the Ukraine, accepting an undertaking offered by the exporting producer in Bulgaria and terminating the proceeding as regards imports of urea originating from Egypt and Poland', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAcceptance of the undertaking offered by Chimco AD is hereby withdrawn.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 is hereby deleted.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 is hereby renumbered ‘Article 3’.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1497/2001 is hereby renumbered ‘Article 4’.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (2), and in particular Article 12 (4) thereof,
Whereas Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 stipulates that a considerable proportion of budgetary resources is to be concentrated on the regions whose development is lagging behind which are covered by Objective 1 and that the resources  available for commitment in respect of these regions are to amount to ECU 96 346 million at 1992 prices for the period 1994 to 1999;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 792/93 establishing a cohesion financial instrument (3) was adopted by the Council on 30 March 1993;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 792/93 makes provision for a Community financial contribution to projects in four Member States, namely Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal;
Whereas Article 12 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 stipulates that for the four Member States covered by the cohesion financial instrument the increase in commitment appropriations for the Structural Funds must permit a doubling of commitments in  real terms under Objective 1 and the cohesion financial instrument between 1992 and 1999;
Whereas the European Council at its meeting in Edinburgh on 11 and 12 December 1992 concluded that this doubling amounted to some ECU 85 billion during the period 1993 to 1999 for the said four Member States;
Whereas, consequently, the commitment appropriations to be drawn from the Structural Funds and the financial instrument for fisheries guidance for the said four Member States in the period 1994 to 1999, leaving aside 1993 and the contribution of the  cohesion financial instrument, are to amount to some ECU 61 505 million;
Whereas the first subparagraph of Article 12 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 specifies that the Commission shall, using transparent procedures, make indicative allocations by Member State for each of Objectives 1 to 4 and 5 (b) of the Structural Fund  commitment appropriations taking full account, as in the past, of the objective criteria of national prosperity, regional prosperity, population of the regions and the relative severity of structural problems, including levels of unemployment and, under  the appropriate Objectives, the development needs of rural areas; whereas these criteria are to be appropriately weighted in the allocation of resources;
Whereas Article 12 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 stipulates that for the period 1994 to 1999, 9 % of the commitment appropriations from the Structural Funds shall be devoted to funding assistance undertaken on the initiative of the Commission in  accordance with Article 5 (5) of that Regulation;
Whereas Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (5), stipulates that a limited part of the appropriations available for Community initiatives under Objectives 1, 2 and 5 (b) may cover areas other  than those referred to in Articles 8, 9 and 11a of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas such appropriations may not have the effect of reducing the amounts allocated under Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 to the regions eligible under Objective 1;
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to set aside less than 9 % of Objective 1 resources for Community initiatives;
Whereas, therefore, the indicative allocation of resources by Member State in the Objective 1 Community support frameworks, expressed in 1994 prices, should amount to ECU 93,81 billion, comprising ECU 59,88 billion for the four Member States covered by  the cohesion financial instrument and ECU 33,93 billion for the other regions eligible under Objective 1,","{'title': '93/589/EEC: Commission Decision of 28 October 1993 fixing an indicative allocation between Member States of the commitment appropriations of the Structural Funds and the financial instrument for fisheries guidance (FIFG) under Objective 1, as defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe indicative allocation between Member States pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 12 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 in respect of the resources to be devoted to the Community support frameworks for Objective 1 as defined in  the said Regulation shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 October 1993.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nBruce MILLAN\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 185, 15. 7. 1988, p. 9.\n\n(2) OJ No L 193, 31. 7. 1993, p. 5.\n\n(3) OJ No L 79, 1. 4. 1993, p. 74.\n\n(4) OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(5) OJ No L 193, 31. 7. 1993, p. 20.\n\nANNEX\n\nINDICATIVE ALLOCATION BETWEEN MEMBER STATES OF THE COMMITMENT APPROPRIATIONS OF THE STRUCTURAL FUNDS AND THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT FOR FISHERIES GUIDANCE (FIFG) IN RESPECT OF THE OBJECTIVE 1 COMMUNITY SUPPORT FRAMEWORKS   1994 to 1999  (in ECU billion, at 1994 prices)\n\n"""" ID=""01"">Greece> ID=""02"">13,98""> ID=""01"">Spain> ID=""02"">26,30""> ID=""01"">Ireland> ID=""02"">5,62""> ID=""01"">Portugal> ID=""02"">13,98 ""> ID=""01"">Total > ID=""02"">59,88 "">\n\n"""" ID=""01"">Belgium> ID=""02"">0,73""> ID=""01"">Germany> ID=""02"">13,64""> ID=""01"">France> ID=""02"">2,19""> ID=""01"">Italy> ID=""02"">14,86""> ID=""01"">The Netherlands> ID=""02"">0,15""> ID=""01"">United Kingdom> ID=""02"">2,36 ""> ID=""01"">Total > ID=""02"">33,93  "">'}]}"

Whereas pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 6 (a) of Protocol 10, it falls upon the Commission, with the assent of the Council, to establish the level of these deliveries;
Whereas, by the terms of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 (a) of the said Joint Declaration, the level of the deliveries must be compatible with the objectives of the restructuring of the Spanish steel industry and with the forecasts used to calculate the evolution of the Community market;
Whereas no significant changes are forecast for the Community market for 1986 in comparison with 1985, and in particular several important aspects of the internal anti-crisis measures will remain;
Whereas, therefore, the Spanish deliveries to the rest of the Community, excluding Portugal, should not register a significant increase in 1986 in comparison with that level agreed between the Commission and Spain for 1985;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (1), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators. That Regulation provides that food business operators are to ensure compliance with specific requirements for the further handling of offal such as stomachs of ruminants and feet of ungulates.
(2) In accordance with Annex III to that Regulation, prior to being transported to another establishment, feet of ungulates destined for further handling are to be skinned or scalded and depilated and stomachs of ruminants must be scalded or cleaned within the slaughterhouse.
(3) The equipment necessary to perform the skinning or scalding and depilating requires a high investment. Therefore, small and medium-size slaughterhouses in particular are not able to handle feet destined for human consumption themselves in a cost-effective way.
(4) While technological developments allow the valorisation of feet of ungulates into food thereby reducing food waste, in particular small and medium-size slaughterhouses are facing practical consequences, hindering such valorisation.
(5) Rennet is refined for the production of cheese and is obtained from stomachs of young ruminants in dedicated establishments. Scalding or cleaning of stomachs substantially reduces the yield of rennet from these stomachs while it does not contribute to the safety of the rennet, being highly refined afterwards.
(6) To promote better regulation and competitiveness a high level of food safety must be maintained, while offering a level-playing field for operators, which is also sustainable for small and medium-size slaughterhouses.
(7) Stomachs of ruminants and feet of ungulates are included in the definition of offal in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The requirements for handling of offal in that Regulation, including the temperature requirements during storage and transport, ensure that these products can be safely handled and transported to an establishment outside the slaughterhouse, collected from different slaughterhouses and valorised. The transport to another establishment of non-skinned or non-scalded and non-depilated feet of ungulates should therefore be allowed by the competent authority.
(8) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the market in sugar (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1599/96 (2), and in particular Articles 14(2) and 37(6) thereof,
Whereas Article 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 lays down that, during the marketing years 1995/96 to 2000/01 and in order to ensure adequate supplies to Community refineries, a special reduced duty is to be levied on imports of raw cane sugar originating in States with which the Community has concluded supply arrangements on preferential terms; whereas at present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 95/284/EC (3) only with the ACP States party to Protocol 8 on ACP sugar annexed to the Fourth ACP-EEC LomĂŠ Convention, and with the Republic of India;
Whereas the quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance; whereas the balance has indicated the need to import raw sugar and to open at this stage for the 1997/98 marketing year a tariff quota at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the abovementioned agreements so that the Community refineries' supply need can be met for part of the year; whereas tariff quotas have in this way been opened by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1314/97 (4) for the period from 1 July 1997 to 28 February 1998; whereas the production forecasts for raw cane sugar are now available for the 1997/98 marketing year; whereas the necessary tariff quotas should consequently be opened for the second part of the marketing year; whereas, because of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member States and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorize imports for each refining Member State, for the period from 1 March to 30 June 1998;
Whereas the above agreements lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question; whereas this minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 1997/98 marketing year;
Whereas in order to avoid a rupture of supplies, provision should be made in respect of the quantities to be imported under Regulation (EC) No 1314/97 for which the licences have not been requested up to 28 February 1998, for the Member States concerned to be authorized to issue the said licences after that date during the 1997/98 marketing year;

Whereas Article 12 (4) of the abovementioned Regulation states that the Commission is to ensure that a special effort is undertaken for the least prosperous regions;
Whereas Article 12 (5) of the abovementioned Regulation states that the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) may devote approximately 80 % of its appropriations to Objective 1;
Whereas the first subparagraph of Article 12 (6) of the abovementioned Regulation states that, to facilitate the planning of assistance in the regions concerned, the Commission is to establish, for a period of five years and as a guide, the allocation between Member States, of 85 % of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF;
Whereas the second suparagraph of Article 12 (6) of the abovementioned Regulation states that this allocation is to be based on the socio-economic criteria determining the eligibility of regions and areas for ERDF assistance under Objectives 1, 2 and 5 (b), while ensuring that the objective of doubling appropriations for the regions covered by Objective 1 takes the form of a substantial increase in assistance in those regions, particularly in the least prosperous regions;
Whereas Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (2) states that, before 1 January 1989, the Commission is to decide, for a period of five years and as a guide, on the indicative allocation between Member States of 85 % of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF;
Whereas Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 states that Article 13 thereof is to apply with effect from the date of adoption of the Regulation;
Whereas, nevertheless, the precise basis for application of the criteria to determining the eligibility of Objective 2 areas cannot at present be established and the selection of Objective 5 b areas is to be made on a progressive basis, and indicative allocations for these objectives have not therefore been calculated;
Whereas, at the same time to respect the provisions of Article 12 (b), the Commission will establish an indicative allocation for 85 % of ERDF resources reserved for Objectives 2 and 5 b as soon as the necessary basis for application of the precise criteria determining the eligibility of regions and areas under these objectives becomes available;
Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 states that, in addition to its support for Objectives 1, 2 and 5 b, the ERDF is to provide support for studies or pilot schemes concerning regional development at Community level, especially where frontier regions of Member States are involved; whereas Article 15 of that Regulation permits transitional financing, as from 1 January 1989, of certain operations involving regions not covered by the said objectives; whereas therefore, the indicative allocation of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF to be fixed pursuant to Article 12 (6) of that Regulation does not concern those appropriations relating to the two categories of operations referred to above,","{'title': '89/250/EEC: Commission Decision of 25 January 1989 fixing an indicative allocation between Member States of 85 % of the commitment appropriations of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Objective 1 as defined by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe indicative allocation between Member States to be established pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 12 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88, in so far as resources to be devoted to Objective 1 as defined by that Regulation are concerned, is given in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 January 1989.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nBruce MILLAN\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 185, 18. 7. 1988, p. 9.\n\n(2) OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1988, p. 15.\n\nANNEX\n\nIndicative percentage allocation between Member States covering 85 % of the commitment appropriations of the ERDF to be devoted to Objective 1\n\n1989-1993\n\n1.2 //  //  // Member State  // Indicative allocation Objective 1   //    //   // Belgium   // -   // Denmark   // -  // Federal Republic of Germany   // -   // Greece   // 16,2  // Spain   // 32,6   // France   // 2,1   // Ireland   // 5,4  // Italy   // 24,5   // Luxembourg   // -   // Netherlands  // -   // Portugal   // 17,5   // United Kingdom   // 1,7  //    //   // Total  // 100,0   //    //'}]}"

(1) Additional quotas to those indicated in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 may be opened when required under special circumstances. The Commission has received a request to open additional quotas in view of trade fairs to be held in 2000.
(2) Additional quotas have already been opened for trade fairs in previous years for certain third countries.
(3) Access to the additional quotas should be limited to products which have been exhibited by the exporting countries at the relevant fair and for the quantities agreed to by sales contracts, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where the fair is taking place.
(4) In order to avoid an overutilisation of these additional quotas it appears appropriate to request the Member State on the territory of which the fair is taking place, on the one hand, to ensure that the total amounts covered by certified contracts do not exceed the limits set for these additional quotas and, on the other hand, to inform the Commission after closure of the fair of the total quantities covered by such certified contracts.
(5) It seems appropriate to apply to imports into the Community of products for which the additional quotas are opened the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 which are applicable to imports of products subject to quantitative limits set out in Annex V to the said Regulation, with the exception of those relating to flexibilities.
(6) Requests for import authorisations should moreover be accompanied by the contract signed at the relevant fair, as certified by the competent authorities of the Member State where it is held.

Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 stipulates that alcohol taken over by the intervention agencies is disposed of either by public sale or by tendering procedures.
(2) Tendering procedures for alcohol are the only sales from intervention in the agricultural sector for which the Commission manages the decision on and opens each sale of this product. In the interests of simplifying legislation and with a view to harmonising measures to manage agricultural markets under the single common organisation of the market, a standing invitation to tender for the sale of alcohol should be opened by the Commission as well as partial invitations to tender opened by the Member States.
(3) To ensure that the information on the partial invitations to tender in the Member States is accessible by all approved undertakings in the Community, that information should be published in electronic form.
(4) To prevent all the alcohol in stock from being sold all at once or for the benefit of just one undertaking, the maximum quantity that may be put up for sale under each partial invitation to tender should be limited.
(5) To ensure that alcohol is disposed of regularly and optimally, and taking account of the slack period during the summer and at Christmas, a deadline for the partial invitations to tender should be laid down once a month, except in July and December.
(6) The various stages and characteristics of the partial invitations to tender should be specified.
(7) Recent experience has shown that plans of the plants where the alcohol is processed into absolute alcohol are not essential for approval of undertakings that may participate in the sale of alcohol for use in the form of bioethanol in the Community. That requirement should therefore be removed from the list of documents to be provided for approval.
(8) To protect the interests of tendering undertakings during the partial invitations to tender, provision should be laid down to limit the physical movement of alcohol put up for sale between the time when the notice for the partial invitation to tender is published and its removal by the undertaking awarded the contract.

Whereas the Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 provide for the opening by the Community of quotas for imports of the following:
- 1 000 tonnes of fresh apples falling within CN code 0808 10, for the period 1 January to 31 December, and
- 1 000 tonnes of fresh pears falling within CN codes 0808 20 10 to 0808 20 39, for the period 1 January to 31 December,

Whereas within the limits of these tariff quotas, customs duties are phased out progressively:
- during the same periods and in accordance with the same timetables provided for in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, by 50 % of the said duties; and that these maximal reduction rates shall be applied from the moment  of entry into force of the present Regulation;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3528/93 (4), and in  particular Article 9 (1) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 of 28 December 1992 laying down the prices and amounts fixed in ecus to be amended as a result of the monetary realignments (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1663/93 (6), and in  particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas cherries are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas cherries harvested during a given crop year are marketed from April to September; Whereas the quantities harvested in April, during the first 20 days of May and from 11 August to 30 September are so small that there is no need to fix reference  prices for these periods; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 21 May to 10 August inclusive;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the proceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteries, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market  preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 establishes a list of prices and amounts for the fruit and vegetables sector which are to be divided by a coefficient of 1,000426 fixing by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 537/93 (7), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No  1331/93 (8), whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 lays down that the resulting reduction in the prices and amounts for each sector concerned shall be specified and the level of such reduced prices fixed; whereas, however, this adjustment may  not result in a reference price level below that of the proceding marketing year, in accordance with Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 718/2001(2), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2190/96(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 298/2000(4), lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported, the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds.
(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, lemons, oranges, apples and peaches of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards and table grapes of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standard can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) The application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation, and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade, gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto.
(9) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables, quotas should be fixed for each product.
(10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2849/2000(6), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1291/2000(7), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(12) Owing to the market situation, in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports, the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1 and A 2 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2190/96 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.
(13) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund, taking account in particular of their perishability.

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1726/70 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1876/84 (4), makes payment of an advance on the premium subject to the conclusion of a cultivation contract or to signature of a crop declaration, duly registered and relating to the leaf tobacco in respect of which the premium is applied for;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1726/70, an advance on the premium in respect of tobacco from the 1982 to 1986 crops in Greece which has, in that country, undergone first-stage processing and packaging may be applied for even where no cultivation contract or crop declaration exists; whereas advances on the premium may be made up to 31 December of the year following that in which the tobacco was harvested;
Whereas the reasons justifying the derogation in respect of applications for an advance on the premium from which purchasers of Greek tobacco from the 1981 and 1982 crops benefited on the basis of the provisions of Article 73 of the Act of Accession of Greece, which were extended in respect of tobacco from the 1986 crop by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 884/85 (5), still remain valid; whereas, despite the efforts made to inform the operators concerned, the greater part of the Greek tobacco crop production at present is still not covered by cultivation contracts;
Whereas cultivation contracts play a key role in tobacco production by enabling production to be better oriented to demand; whereas it would seem advisable to maintain the derogation from which tobacco from the 1981 to 1986 crops benefited for tobacco from the coming harvest in order to encourage tobacco purchasers and planters to sign a greater number of cultivation contracts so that each of them may benefit from the advantages that these entail;
Whereas a maximum period of two years would seem adequate for the contractual system laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1726/70 to be effectively applied in Greece; whereas the derogation in question should therefore be extended to cover tobacco from the 1987 and 1988 crops;
Whereas the condition laid down in Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1726/70 pursuant to which leaf tobacco must have undergone first-stage processing and packaging in the country of production to be able to benefit from an advance on the premium, is not appropriate to the objectives pursued by the provision in question and could, moreover, give rise to discrimination between operators from the Member State of production and those of other Member States; whereas it should therefore be deleted;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 4(2)(e), Article 5(2)(g) and Article 6(2)(i) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 of 19 January 2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards means of disposal or uses of animal by-products and amending its Annex VI as regards biogas transformation and processing of rendered fats (2) lays down implementing rules for certain alternative methods of disposal or use of animal by-products (alternative methods).
(2) In particular, Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 requires the marking of certain material arising from the use of alternative methods and determines the permitted end uses of such material. Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1432/2007 (3), lays down harmonised rules for the marking of animal by-products which contribute to their proper identification and improve their traceability of animal by-products. The reference to Annex VI of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 should be amended accordingly.
(3) On the basis of the opinion of the Scientific Panel on biological hazards of the European Food Safety Authority on the ‘Biodiesel Process as a method for safe disposal of Category 1 animal by-products (ABP)’ adopted on 2 June 2004 (4), it is appropriate to permit additional end uses of Category 1, Category 2 and Category 3 materials, in accordance with the general principles laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. The combustion of biodiesel produced in accordance with Annex IV of Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 in stationary or mobile engines should also be permitted.
(4) In particular, the landfill of material arising from the processing of Category 1 material on sites for which a permit has been issued in accordance with Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste (5) should now be permitted.
(5) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 lays down certain special surveillance measures to be carried out in the first two years of implementation of certain alternative methods within a particular Member State. The requirements related to these surveillance measures should take into account experience with the practical application of a process developed in another Member State and should be adjusted to the objective to ensure a high level of protection of public and animal health. The designation and supervision of a pilot plant for the first use of an alternative method in each Member State concerned should therefore be subject to simplified conditions.
(6) The tests which have to be carried out during the initial stage of implementation of an alternative method should be based on the tests which were carried out for the assessment of the particular alternative method by the appropriate scientific body.
(7) The results of the additional surveillance in a particular Member State should be made available to other Member States for the evaluation of new applications for the use of one of the alternative methods concerned on their respective territories. Information should be provided to the contact points for alternative methods which are indicated on the list which is published electronically by the Commission.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 92/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

It may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.\n\n((9)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 25 June 2004.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nto Commission Regulation of 24 June 2004 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nRefunds\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n43,08\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09400\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1102\xa020\xa090\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09100\nC11\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09900\nC11\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa030\xa09100\nC11\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa040\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n55,39\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09300\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n43,08\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09500\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1103\xa013\xa090\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1103\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa060\xa09000\nC12\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa020\xa09000\nC11\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa069\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09110\nC10\nEUR/t\n49,23\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09130\nC10\nEUR/t\n40,00\n1104\xa029\xa001\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa003\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa020\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n46,16\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n35,39\n1104\xa029\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa051\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa055\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n7,69\n1107\xa010\xa011\xa09000\nC13\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1107\xa010\xa091\xa09000\nC13\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n49,23\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n49,23\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n49,23\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n49,23\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1109\xa000\xa000\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa051\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n48,23\n1702\xa030\xa059\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1702\xa030\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n48,23\n1702\xa030\xa099\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1702\xa040\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n48,23\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\n1702\xa090\xa075\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n50,54\n1702\xa090\xa079\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n35,08\n2106\xa090\xa055\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n36,92\nNB:\nThe product codes and the ‘A’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10\n:\nAll destinations\nC11\n:\nAll destinations except for Bulgaria\nC12\n:\nAll destinations except for Romania\nC13\n:\nAll destinations except for Bulgaria and Romania\n(\n1\n)\nNo refund shall be granted on products given a heat treatment resulting in pregelatinisation of the starch.\n(\n2\n)\nRefunds are granted in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2730/75 (\nOJ L 281, 1.11.1975, p. 20\n), as amended.'}]}"

amending Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs as regards Fusarium toxins in maize and maize products
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) sets maximum levels for Fusarium toxins in certain foodstuffs.
(2) Maximum levels should be set at a strict level which is reasonably achievable by following good agricultural and manufacturing practices and taking into account the risk related to the consumption of the food.
(3) Climatic conditions during the growth, in particular at flowering, have a major influence on the Fusarium toxin content. However, good agricultural practices, whereby the risk factors are reduced to a minimum, can prevent to a certain degree the contamination by Fusarium fungi. Commission Recommendation 2006/583/EC of 17 August 2006 on the prevention and reduction of Fusarium toxins in cereals and cereal products (3), including maize and maize products contains general principles for the prevention and reduction of Fusarium toxin contamination (zearalenone, fumonisins and trichothecenes) in cereals to be implemented by the development of national codes of practice based on these principles.
(4) Maximum levels were established in 2005 for Fusarium toxins in cereals and cereal products, including maize and maize products. For maize, not all factors involved in the formation of Fusarium toxins, in particular zearalenone and fumonisins B1 and B2, were precisely known. Therefore, the maximum levels in maize and maize products were foreseen to apply only from 1 July 2007 for deoxynivalenol ad zearalenone and from 1 October 2007 for fumonisins B1 and B2, in case no changed maximum levels based on new information on occurrence and formation are set before that time. This time period enabled food business operators in the cereal chain to perform investigations on the sources of the formation of these mycotoxins and on the identification of the management measures to be taken to prevent their presence as far as reasonably possible.
(5) Taking into account new information since 2005, it appears necessary to amend the maximum levels in maize and maize products as well as the date of application of these levels.
(6) Recent information has been provided demonstrating that for the harvest 2005 and 2006 higher levels have been observed in maize than for the harvest 2003 and 2004 of mainly zearalenone and fumonisins and to a lesser extent deoxynivalenol, linked to the weather conditions. The foreseen levels for zearalenone and fumonisins are therefore under certain weather conditions not achievable for maize, even when applying prevention measures to the extent possible. Therefore the maximum levels need to be amended in order to avoid a disruption of the market whilst maintaining a high level of public health protection by ensuring that human exposure will remain significantly below the health based guidance value.
(7) In order to ensure a correct and smooth application of these maximum levels, it is also appropriate that they apply to all maize and maize products harvested in a season and therefore the date of application should reflect the beginning of the marketing season of the next harvest year. As the harvest of maize in Europe starts usually mid-September and runs until the end of October, it is appropriate to take 1 October 2007 as date of application.
(8) In the light of the foregoing this Regulation should apply from 1 July 2007.
(9) In addition, a number of minor technical changes should also be made.
(10) It is appropriate to provide that the maximum level does not apply to the unprocessed maize intended to be processed by wet milling (starch production). Indeed, scientific data have shown that regardless the levels of Fusarium toxins present in unprocessed maize, Fusarium toxins were not detected or only at very low levels in starch produced from maize. Nevertheless, in order to protect public and animal health, food business operators in the wet milling sector should intensively monitor the by-products from the wet milling process destined for animal feeding to check compliance with the guidance values referred in Commission Recommendation 2006/576/EC of 17 August 2006 on the presence of deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, T-2 and HT-2 and fumonisins in products intended for animal feeding (4).
(11) The dry milling process results in milling fractions with different particle size from the same batch of unprocessed maize. Scientific data show that the milling fractions with smaller particle size contain a higher level of Fusarium toxins than the milling fractions with a larger particle size. Maize milling fractions are classified according to the particle size in different headings in the Combined Nomenclature based upon a rate of passage through a sieve with an aperture of 500 microns. Different maximum levels for milling fractions smaller and larger than 500 microns should be set to reflect the contamination level of the different fractions.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '29.9.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 255/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1126/2007\nof 28 September 2007\namending Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs as regardsFusariumtoxins in maize and maize products\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(2)sets maximum levels forFusariumtoxins in certain foodstuffs.\n\n((2)) Maximum levels should be set at a strict level which is reasonably achievable by following good agricultural and manufacturing practices and taking into account the risk related to the consumption of the food.\n\n((3)) Climatic conditions during the growth, in particular at flowering, have a major influence on theFusariumtoxin content.

","COMMISSION DIRECTIVE  of 13 June 1991  laying down the categories of ingredients which may be used for the purposes of labelling compound feedingstuffs for animals other than pet animals  (91/357/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs (1), as last amended by Directive 90/44/EEC (2), and in particular Article 10 (a) thereof,
Whereas, as regards labelling, the purpose of Directive 79/373/EEC is to ensure that stock farmers are informed objectively and as accurately as possible as to the composition and use of feedingstuffs;
Whereas the quantitative determination of the ingredients in feedingstuffs for production animals currently raises verification difficulties, mainly because of the nature of the products used, of the complexity of the mixtures made or the manufacturing  methods adopted;
Whereas it is accordingly appropriate at this stage to prefer, at least for feedingstuffs for production animals, a flexible declaration arrangement confined to the indication of the feedingstuff ingredients without stating their quantity; whereas it  has furthermore proved necessary to provide for the establishment of categories making it possible to group several ingredients under a single name;
Whereas it is provided by Directive 79/373/EEC that in the light of advances in scientific knowledge categories grouping several ingredients shall be established not later than 22 January 1991;
Whereas, since categories of ingredients have already been established by Commission Directive 82/475/EEC (3) for compound feedingstuffs intended for pets, similar provisions should be adopted for feedingstuffs intended for other animals, within the  meaning of Directive 79/373/EEC, than pet animals;
Whereas, however, it is not possible to establish categories covering all the ingredients of compound feedingstuffs; whereas, therefore, the manufacturer should indicate in addition any ingredients not belonging to any of the categories listed in the  Annex;
Whereas the ingredients in category 12 'Land animal products' must, moreover, comply with the provisions of Council Directive 90/667/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down the veterinary rules for the disposal and processing of animal waste, for its  placing on the market and for the prevention of pathogens in feedingstuffs of animal or fish origin and amending Directive 90/425/EEC (4);
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 91/357/EEC of 13 June 1991 laying down the categories of ingredients which may be used for the purposes of labelling compound feedingstuffs for animals other than pet animals', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nWhere, pursuant to Article 5 (c) (3) of Directive 79/373/EEC, the indication of the specific name of the ingredient may be replaced by the name of the category to which the ingredient belongs, only the categories listed in the Annex hereto  may be indicated on the packaging, container or label of compound feedingstuffs for animals other than pet animals.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nMember States shall bring into force not later than 22 January 1992 the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the provisions of this Directive.

Tunisia has transmitted an amendment to the relevant specifications provided in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 following the creation of a new general direction in charge of organic farming in the agricultural department, which has become the new competent authority responsible for the control system in Tunisia.
(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 590/2011 (3) has inserted in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 a new text relating to Canada. Point 1 ‘Product categories’ of that text contains an error in so far it has established a separate point (c) for ‘feed’ as one of those categories, while indeed it constitutes one of the possible uses of ‘processed agricultural products’ referred to in point 1(b) of the said text.
(3) Canada informed the Commission that the list of control bodies included in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 includes another error, as the control body ‘Control Union Certifications’ is not accredited by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to provide certification services in Canada.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended and corrected accordingly.

of 18 July 2005
on the Agreement between the Community of European Railways (CER) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on certain aspects of the working conditions of mobile workers engaged in interoperable cross-border services in the railway sector
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 139(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) This Directive complies with the fundamental rights and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and is designed to ensure full compliance with Article 31 thereof, which provides that all workers have the right to healthy, safe and dignified working conditions, to a limit on their maximum working time and to weekly and daily rest periods and an annual period of paid holidays.
(2) The social partners may, in accordance with Article 139(2) of the Treaty, jointly request that Agreements concluded at Community level be implemented by a Council Decision on a proposal from the Commission.
(3) The Council adopted Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (1). Rail transport was one of the sectors of activity excluded from the scope of that Directive. The European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2000/34/EC (2) amending Directive 93/104/EC in order to cover the sectors and activities which had previously been excluded.
(4) The European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2003/88/EC of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time (3), which codified and repealed Directive 93/104/EC.
(5) Directive 2003/88/EC provides for derogations from Articles 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16 thereof in the case of persons working in the rail transport sector on board trains.
(6) The Community of European Railways (CER) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) have informed the Commission of their desire to enter into negotiations in accordance with Article 139(1) of the Treaty.
(7) On 27 January 2004 those organisations concluded an Agreement on certain aspects of the working conditions of mobile workers engaged in interoperable cross-border services, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Agreement’.
(8) The Agreement included a joint request for the Commission to implement the Agreement by a Council Decision on a proposal from the Commission in accordance with Article 139(2) of the Treaty.
(9) Directive 2003/88/EC applies to mobile workers engaged in interoperable cross-border services, except where more specific provisions are contained in this Directive and in the Agreement annexed thereto.
(10) For the purposes of Article 249 of the Treaty, the appropriate instrument for implementing the Agreement is a Directive.
(11) Since, in the light of completion of the internal market in the rail transport sector and the competition in the sector, the objectives of this Directive, which is intended to protect health and safety, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(12) The development of the European railways sector requires close monitoring of the role of current and new actors, in order to ensure harmonious development throughout the Community. The European social dialogue in this field should be able to reflect this development and to take it into account as far as possible.
(13) This Directive leaves the Member States free to define those terms of the Agreement that it does not specify in accordance with national legislation and practice, as is the case for other Directives on social policy matters using similar terms, as long as the definitions used are compatible with the Agreement.
(14) The Commission has prepared its proposal for a Directive in accordance with its Communication of 20 May 1998 entitled ‘Adapting and promoting social dialogue at Community level’, taking into account the representative status of the contracting parties and the legality of each clause of the Agreement; the signatories are sufficiently representative of the mobile railway workers assigned to interoperable cross-border services run by the railway companies.
(15) The Commission has drawn up its proposal for a Directive in accordance with Article 137(2) of the Treaty, which provides that Directives in the social domain shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings.
(16) This Directive and the Agreement lay down minimum standards; the Member States and/or the social partners should be able to maintain or introduce more favourable provisions.
(17) The Commission has informed the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions by sending them the proposal for a Directive for implementing the Agreement.
(18) The European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Agreement of the social partners on 26 May 2005.
(19) Implementing the Agreement will contribute to achieving the aims set out in Article 136 of the Treaty.
(20) In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law-making (4), Member States will be encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables, which will, as far as possible, illustrate the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures and to make them public,","{'header': '27.7.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 195/15', 'title': 'COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2005/47/EC\nof 18 July 2005\non the Agreement between the Community of European Railways (CER) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on certain aspects of the working conditions of mobile workers engaged in interoperable cross-border services in the railway sector', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) This Directive complies with the fundamental rights and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and is designed to ensure full compliance with Article 31 thereof, which provides that all workers have the right to healthy, safe and dignified working conditions, to a limit on their maximum working time and to weekly and daily rest periods and an annual period of paid holidays.\n\n((2)) The social partners may, in accordance with Article 139(2) of the Treaty, jointly request that Agreements concluded at Community level be implemented by a Council Decision on a proposal from the Commission.\n\n((3)) The Council adopted Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time(1).

Whereas on 14 June 1988, the Spanish Government asked the Commission of the European Communities, under the first paragraph of Article 115 of the Treaty, for authorization to apply surveillance and protective measures in respect of imports of certain slide fasteners, falling within CN codes 9607 19 00 and 9607 20 91, originating in Taiwan and put into free circulation in the other Member States;
Whereas the Commission, under Regulation (EEC) No 3752/87 (2), instituted a system for the authorization of imports of the slide fasteners in question originating in Taiwan for the period up to 31 December 1988, within certain limits;
Whereas there are accordingly disparities between Spain and the other Member States in the conditions governing the importations of the products concerned; whereas such disparities could cause deflection of trade;
Whereas the Spanish Government has indicated that the limits laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3752/87 have been reached and even exceeded; whereas a flow of indirect imports of the slide fasteners concerned originating in Taiwan and put into free circulation in the other Member States has become established; whereas these indirect imports have reached a quantity of 1,263 million metres;

(2014/688/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2005/387/JHA of 10 May 2005 on the information exchange, risk-assessment and control of new psychoactive substances (1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Risk assessment reports on the new psychoactive substances 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (25I-NBOMe), 3,4-dichloro-N-[[1-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]methyl]benzamide (AH-7921), 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone (methoxetamine) were drawn up in compliance with Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), and were subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 23 April 2014.
(2) 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine had not been under assessment at the United Nations' level by the time the risk assessment was requested at Union level, but they were evaluated in June 2014 by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence of the World Health Organization.
(3) 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine have no established or acknowledged medical use (human or veterinary). Apart from their use in analytical reference materials, and in scientific research investigating their chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology as a result of their emergence on the drug market — and, in the case of 25I-NBOMe, also in the field of neurochemistry — there is no indication that they are being used for other purposes.
(4) 25I-NBOMe is a potent synthetic derivative of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine (2C-I), a classical serotonergic hallucinogen, which was subject to risk assessment and to control measures and criminal sanctions at Union level from 2003 by Council Decision 2003/847/JHA (2).
(5) The specific physical effects of 25I-NBOMe are difficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological and behavioural effects, and dependence potential, and because of the limited information and data available. Clinical observations of individuals who have used this substance suggest that it has hallucinogenic effects and has the potential for inducing severe agitation, confusion, intense auditory and visual hallucinations, aggression, violent accidents and self-induced trauma.
(6) There have been four deaths associated with 25I-NBOMe registered in three Member States. Severe toxicity associated with its use has been reported in four Member States, which notified 32 non-fatal intoxications. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant. There is no information available on the social risks associated with 25I-NBOMe.
(7) 22 Member States and Norway have reported to the EMCDDA and European Police Office (Europol) that they detected 25I-NBOMe. No prevalence data is available on the use of 25I-NBOMe, but the limited information that exists suggests that it may be consumed in a wide range of settings, such as at home, in bars, nightclubs and at music festivals.
(8) 25I-NBOMe is openly marketed and sold on the internet as a ‘research chemical’ and information from seizures, collected samples, user websites and internet retailers suggests that it is being sold as a drug in its own right and also marketed as a ‘legal’ replacement for LSD. EMCDDA identified more than 15 internet retailers selling this substance, who may be based within the Union and China.
(9) The risk assessment report reveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on 25I-NBOMe and points out that further research would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for subjecting 25I-NBOMe to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it and of the lack of medical value or use of the substance, 25I-NBOMe should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
(10) Since six Member States control 25I-NBOMe under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and seven Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles to cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would help protect against the risks that its availability and use can pose.
(11) AH-7921 is a structurally atypical synthetic opioid analgesic commonly known by internet suppliers, user websites and media as ‘doxylam’. It can be easily confused with ‘doxylamine’, an antihistaminic medicine with sedative-hypnotic properties, which could lead to unintentional overdoses.
(12) The specific physical effects of AH-7921 are difficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological, behavioural effects, and dependence potential, as well as the limited information and data available. Based on user reports, the effects of AH-7921 appear to resemble those of classical opioids with the feeling of mild euphoria, itchiness and relaxation; nausea appears to be a typical adverse effect. In addition to self-experimentation with AH-7921, as well as ‘recreational use’, some of the users report self-medicating with this new drug to relieve pain, others to alleviate withdrawal symptoms due to cessation of the use of other opioids. This may indicate a potential of AH-7921 to spread among the injecting opioid population.
(13) There is no prevalence data on the use of AH-7921, but the information available suggests that it is not widely used, and that when it is used, that use is in the home environment.
(14) 15 fatalities were recorded in three Member States between December 2012 and September 2013 where AH-7921, alone or in combination with other substances, was detected in post-mortem samples. While it is not possible to determine with certainty the role of AH-7921 in all of those fatalities, in some cases it has been specifically noted in the cause of death. One Member State reported six non-fatal intoxications associated with AH-7921. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant. There is no information available on the social risks associated with AH-7921.
(15) The risk assessment report reveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on AH-7921 and points out that further research would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for subjecting AH-7921 to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use of the substance, AH-7921 should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
(16) Since one Member State controls AH-7921 under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and five Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would help protect against the risks that its availability and use can pose.
(17) MDPV is a ring-substituted synthetic derivative of cathinone chemically related to pyrovalerone, which are both subject to control under the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
(18) Information on the chronic and acute toxicity associated with MDPV, as well as on psychological and behavioural effects, and on dependence potential, is not collected uniformly across the Union. Information from published studies, confirmed by clinical cases, suggests that the psychopharmacological profile observed for MDPV is similar to that for cocaine and methamphetamine, albeit more potent and longer lasting. Furthermore, MDPV was found to be 10 times more potent in its ability to induce locomotor activation, tachycardia and hypertension.
(19) Users' websites indicate that its acute toxicity can provoke adverse effects on humans, similar to those associated with other stimulants. These include paranoid psychosis, tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, breathing problems, severe agitation, auditory and visual hallucinations, profound anxiety, hyperthermia, violent outbursts and multiple organ dysfunctions.
(20) 108 fatalities were registered in eight Member States and Norway between September 2009 and August 2013, where MDPV has been detected in post-mortem biological samples or implicated in the cause of death. A total of 525 non-fatal intoxications associated with MDPV have been reported by eight Member States. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant.
(21) The detection of MDPV has also been reported in biological samples related to fatal and non-fatal road traffic accidents, or driving under the influence of drugs, in four Member States since 2009.
(22) MDPV has been present in the Union drug market since November 2008 and 27 Member States, Norway and Turkey reported multi-kilogram seizures of the substance. MDPV is being sold as a substance in its own right, but it has also been detected in combination with other substances. It is widely available from internet suppliers and retailers, ‘head shops’ and street-level dealers. There are some indications that suggest a degree of organisation in the tableting and distribution of this substance in the Union.
(23) The risk assessment report reveals that further research would be needed to determine the health and social risks posed by MDPV. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for subjecting MDPV to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use of the substance, MDPV should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
(24) Since 21 Member States control MDPV under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and four Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would protect against the risks that its availability and use can pose.
(25) Methoxetamine is an arylcyclohexylamine substance which is chemically similar to ketamine and the internationally controlled substance phencyclidine (PCP). Like ketamine and PCP, it has dissociative properties.
(26) There are no studies assessing the chronic and acute toxicity associated with methoxetamine, as well as its psychological and behavioural effects, and dependence potential. Self-reported experiences from user websites suggest adverse effects similar to ketamine intoxication. These include nausea and severe vomiting, difficulty in breathing, seizures, disorientation, anxiety, catatonia, aggression, hallucination, paranoia and psychosis. In addition, acute methoxetamine intoxications may include stimulant effects (agitation, tachycardia and hypertension) and cerebral features, which are not expectable with acute ketamine intoxication.
(27) Twenty deaths associated with methoxetamine were reported by six Member States that detected the substance in post-mortem samples. Used alone or in combination with other substances, methoxetamine was detected in 20 non-fatal intoxications reported by five Member States. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant.
(28) 23 Member States, Turkey and Norway have reported that they detected methoxetamine, since November 2010. Information suggests that it is sold and used as a substance in its own right, but it is also sold as a ‘legal’ replacement for ketamine by internet retailers, ‘head shops’ and street-level drug dealers.
(29) Multi-kilogram quantities in powder form were seized within the Union, but there is no information on the possible involvement of organised crime. The manufacture of methoxetamine does not require sophisticated equipment.
(30) Prevalence data are limited to non-representative studies in two Member States. Those studies suggest that the prevalence of the use of methoxetamine is lower than that of ketamine. The available information suggests that it may be consumed in a wide range of settings, including at home, in bars, nightclubs and at music festivals.
(31) The risk assessment report reveals that further research would be needed to determine the health and social risks posed by methoxetamine. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient grounds for subjecting methoxetamine to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it, and of the lack of medical value or use, methoxetamine should be subjected to control measures across the Union.
(32) Since nine Member States control methoxetamine under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and nine Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles in cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would protect against the risks that its availability and use can pose.
(33) Decision 2005/387/JHA reserves to the Council implementing powers with a view to giving a quick and expertise-based response at the Union level to the emergence of new psychoactive substances detected and reported by the Member States, by submitting those substances to control measures across the Union. As the conditions and procedure for triggering the exercise of such implementing powers have been met, an implementing decision should be adopted in order to put 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine under control across the Union,","{'header': '1.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 287/22', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 25 September 2014\non subjecting 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (25I-NBOMe), 3,4-dichloro-N-[[1-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]methyl]benzamide (AH-7921), 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone (methoxetamine) to control measures\n(2014/688/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Risk assessment reports on the new psychoactive substances 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (25I-NBOMe), 3,4-dichloro-N-[[1-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]methyl]benzamide (AH-7921), 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-2-(ethylamino)cyclohexanone (methoxetamine) were drawn up in compliance with Decision 2005/387/JHA by a special session of the extended Scientific Committee of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), and were subsequently submitted to the Commission and to the Council on 23 April 2014.\n\n((2)) 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine had not been under assessment at the United Nations' level by the time the risk assessment was requested at Union level, but they were evaluated in June 2014 by the Expert Committee on Drug Dependence of the World Health Organization.\n\n((3)) 25I-NBOMe, AH-7921, MDPV and methoxetamine have no established or acknowledged medical use (human or veterinary). Apart from their use in analytical reference materials, and in scientific research investigating their chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology as a result of their emergence on the drug market — and, in the case of 25I-NBOMe, also in the field of neurochemistry — there is no indication that they are being used for other purposes.\n\n((4)) 25I-NBOMe is a potent synthetic derivative of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine (2C-I), a classical serotonergic hallucinogen, which was subject to risk assessment and to control measures and criminal sanctions at Union level from 2003 by Council Decision 2003/847/JHA(2).\n\n((5)) The specific physical effects of 25I-NBOMe are difficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological and behavioural effects, and dependence potential, and because of the limited information and data available. Clinical observations of individuals who have used this substance suggest that it has hallucinogenic effects and has the potential for inducing severe agitation, confusion, intense auditory and visual hallucinations, aggression, violent accidents and self-induced trauma.\n\n((6)) There have been four deaths associated with 25I-NBOMe registered in three Member States. Severe toxicity associated with its use has been reported in four Member States, which notified 32 non-fatal intoxications. If this new psychoactive substance were to become more widely available and used, the implications for individual and public health could be significant. There is no information available on the social risks associated with 25I-NBOMe.\n\n((7)) 22 Member States and Norway have reported to the EMCDDA and European Police Office (Europol) that they detected 25I-NBOMe. No prevalence data is available on the use of 25I-NBOMe, but the limited information that exists suggests that it may be consumed in a wide range of settings, such as at home, in bars, nightclubs and at music festivals.\n\n((8)) 25I-NBOMe is openly marketed and sold on the internet as a ‘research chemical’ and information from seizures, collected samples, user websites and internet retailers suggests that it is being sold as a drug in its own right and also marketed as a ‘legal’ replacement for LSD. EMCDDA identified more than 15 internet retailers selling this substance, who may be based within the Union and China.\n\n((9)) The risk assessment report reveals that there is limited scientific evidence available on 25I-NBOMe and points out that further research would be needed to determine the health and social risks that it poses. However, the available evidence and information provides sufficient ground for subjecting 25I-NBOMe to control measures across the Union. As a result of the health risks that it poses, as documented by its detection in several reported fatalities, of the fact that users may unknowingly consume it and of the lack of medical value or use of the substance, 25I-NBOMe should be subjected to control measures across the Union.\n\n((10)) Since six Member States control 25I-NBOMe under national legislation complying with the obligations of the 1971 United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and seven Member States use other legislative measures to control it, subjecting this substance to control measures across the Union would help avoid the emergence of obstacles to cross-border law enforcement and judicial cooperation, and would help protect against the risks that its availability and use can pose.\n\n((11)) AH-7921 is a structurally atypical synthetic opioid analgesic commonly known by internet suppliers, user websites and media as ‘doxylam’. It can be easily confused with ‘doxylamine’, an antihistaminic medicine with sedative-hypnotic properties, which could lead to unintentional overdoses.\n\n((12)) The specific physical effects of AH-7921 are difficult to determine because there are no published studies assessing its acute and chronic toxicity, its psychological, behavioural effects, and dependence potential, as well as the limited information and data available. Based on user reports, the effects of AH-7921 appear to resemble those of classical opioids with the feeling of mild euphoria, itchiness and relaxation; nausea appears to be a typical adverse effect. In addition to self-experimentation with AH-7921, as well as ‘recreational use’, some of the users report self-medicating with this new drug to relieve pain, others to alleviate withdrawal symptoms due to cessation of the use of other opioids. This may indicate a potential of AH-7921 to spread among the injecting opioid population.\n\n((13)) There is no prevalence data on the use of AH-7921, but the information available suggests that it is not widely used, and that when it is used, that use is in the home environment.\n\n((14)) 15 fatalities were recorded in three Member States between December 2012 and September 2013 where AH-7921, alone or in combination with other substances, was detected in post-mortem samples.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (1), and in particular Article 20(1) and Article 21(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2003/804/EC of 14 November 2003 laying down the animal health conditions and certification requirements for imports of molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption (2), sets out the specific animal health conditions for imports of live molluscs into the Community from third countries.
(2) It is necessary to take into consideration that imports of small quantities of molluscs, often high-value products, directly for retail sale to supermarkets or restaurants, may represent a low animal health risk, as these consignments are not for further growth, fattening, or relaying in Community waters.
(3) The requirements laid down in Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs (3), and Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products (4), give the appropriate level of protection as regards live molluscs packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer, provided the molluscs do not come in contact with Community waters. Additional animal health certification for such consignments should not be necessary.
(4) It is further necessary to take into consideration the possibility that imports of live molluscs, which would not fully comply with the requirements laid down in Article 3 of Decision 2003/804/EC for situations where the molluscs are bound for further processing, could be channelled to import centres approved according to Article 8 of Decision 2003/804/EC, and packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer. In such situations, the imported molluscs will not come in direct contact with natural waters in the Community.
(5) Live bivalve molluscs should be treated as live aquatic animals where they are for further breeding and production, but they may also be considered as products where they are for immediate human consumption, except that they are transported in the live state to preserve freshness. However, as regards veterinary checks, all live bivalve molluscs should be examined in facilities approved to handle products of animal origin, which are more appropriate for handling such consignments.
(6) Live bivalve molluscs imported from third countries should therefore be subject to veterinary checks according to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (5).
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 of 18 February 2004 introducing a document for the declaration of, and veterinary checks on, animals from third countries entering the Community (6), has replaced Commission Decision 92/527/EC (7). Where live bivalve molluscs are destined for breeding or production the control procedure in Article 8 of Directive 97/78/EC should be used and the common veterinary entry document in Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 completed accordingly by the official veterinarian.
(8) Where live bivalve molluscs are imported and intended for human consumption the common veterinary entry document set down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down the procedures for the veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries (8) should be used and completed accordingly by the official veterinarian.
(9) In order not to interrupt imports unnecessarily, taking into account the low animal health risk such consignments represent, the control procedures laid down in Article 6 of Decision 2003/804/EC should be amended accordingly, and Annex IV deleted.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '31.8.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 280/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 23 July 2004\namending Decision 2003/804/EC as regards imports of live molluscs for human consumption\n(notified under document number C(2004) 2613)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2004/623/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2003/804/EC of 14 November 2003 laying down the animal health conditions and certification requirements for imports of molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption(2), sets out the specific animal health conditions for imports of live molluscs into the Community from third countries.\n\n((2)) It is necessary to take into consideration that imports of small quantities of molluscs, often high-value products, directly for retail sale to supermarkets or restaurants, may represent a low animal health risk, as these consignments are not for further growth, fattening, or relaying in Community waters.\n\n((3)) The requirements laid down in Council Directive 91/492/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs(3), and Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(4), give the appropriate level of protection as regards live molluscs packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer, provided the molluscs do not come in contact with Community waters.

Where live bivalve molluscs are destined for breeding or production the control procedure in Article 8 of Directive 97/78/EC should be used and the common veterinary entry document in Regulation (EC) No 282/2004 completed accordingly by the official veterinarian.\n\n((8)) Where live bivalve molluscs are imported and intended for human consumption the common veterinary entry document set down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down the procedures for the veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries(8)should be used and completed accordingly by the official veterinarian.\n\n((9)) In order not to interrupt imports unnecessarily, taking into account the low animal health risk such consignments represent, the control procedures laid down in Article 6 of Decision 2003/804/EC should be amended accordingly, and Annex IV deleted.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Conditions related to the importation of live molluscs intended for human consumption', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2003/804/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 4 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 4\nConditions related to the importation of live molluscs intended for human consumption\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall authorise the importation into their territory of live molluscs intended for further processing before human consumption only if the consignment:\n(a)\ncomplies with the conditions laid down in Article 3(1); or\n(b)\nis sent directly to an approved import centre for further processing.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall authorise the importation into their territory of live molluscs intended for immediate human consumption only if the molluscs originate in third countries and establishments authorised under Article 9 of Directive 91/492/EEC and Article 11 of Directive 91/493/EEC and comply with the public health certification requirements laid down under those Directives; and\neither\n(a)\nthe consignment consists of molluscs packed in packages of a size suitable for retail sale to restaurants or directly to the consumer; and the packages are clearly labelled with the following text “\nLive molluscs for immediate human consumption.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 6 and the second paragraph of Article 24 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 1(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (2) defines ‘invitation to tender’ and the related award conditions. In order to avoid any ambiguity as regards the award of the contract, it is necessary to clarify those conditions.
(2) Under the third subparagraph of Article 2(1) and the third subparagraph of Article 7(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93, a period of at least eight days must elapse between the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of decisions opening invitations to tender for sale on the Community market or for export and the first closing date for the submission of tenders. The first paragraph of Article 12 of that Regulation provides for the same period between the publication of the notice of invitation to tender and the first closing date for submission of tenders. These time limits now appear too long, in view of the progress made in communications and information provision by electronic means, and should therefore be reduced.
(3) Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 specifies minimum rules for publicising notices of invitations to tender and lays down certain general rules applicable to standing invitations to tender, irrespective of the destination of the products. For the sake of clarity, those rules should appear in Title III of that Regulation setting out general and final provisions.
(4) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 specifies the information to be sent to the Commission following the submission of tenders, and the terms for accepting the tenders, in particular as regards price. For the sake of effective management, the lot to which the tender relates should be identified, and the circumstances in which the fixing of the minimum selling price should not prejudice other export operations should be specified.
(5) Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 lays down general provisions on the notice of invitation to tender. For the sake of clarity, the provisions deleted from Article 3 should appear in this Article.
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 contains entries in all Community languages. Under Council Regulation No 1 of 6 October 1958 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 920/2005 (4), Irish has been one of the official languages of the Community since 1 January 2007.

These time limits now appear too long, in view of the progress made in communications and information provision by electronic means, and should therefore be reduced.\n\n((3)) Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 specifies minimum rules for publicising notices of invitations to tender and lays down certain general rules applicable to standing invitations to tender, irrespective of the destination of the products. For the sake of clarity, those rules should appear in Title III of that Regulation setting out general and final provisions.\n\n((4)) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 specifies the information to be sent to the Commission following the submission of tenders, and the terms for accepting the tenders, in particular as regards price. For the sake of effective management, the lot to which the tender relates should be identified, and the circumstances in which the fixing of the minimum selling price should not prejudice other export operations should be specified.\n\n((5)) Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 lays down general provisions on the notice of invitation to tender. For the sake of clarity, the provisions deleted from Article 3 should appear in this Article.\n\n((6)) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((7)) Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 contains entries in all Community languages. Under Council Regulation No 1 of 6 October 1958 determining the languages to be used by the European Economic Community(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 920/2005(4), Irish has been one of the official languages of the Community since 1 January 2007.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 23 September 1977 approving aids from the Kingdom of Belgium to the coal-mining industry during the year 1976 (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic) (77/624/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Articles 2, 3, 4 and 5 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 528/76/ECSC of 25 February 1976 regarding the Community system of measures taken by the Member States to assist the coal-mining industry (1),
Having consulted the Council,
Whereas the Belgian Government has informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 2 of Decision No 528/76/ECSC, of the financial measures which it intends to take during the year 1976 in order to give direct or indirect support to the coal-mining industry ; whereas, of these measures, the following aids qualify for approval pursuant to that Decision;
Whereas in 1976 the Belgian Government intends to grant aids totalling Bfrs 241 300 000 for investment financing, comprising Bfrs 230 000 000 for the Campine coalfield and Bfrs 11 300 000 for the Sud coalfield ; whereas the aid for the Campine coalfield is intended to cover depreciation, thereby enabling the coalfield to maintain production of coking coal, which is important to the Belgian steel industry ; whereas the investment aid for the Sud coalfield will enable this coalfield to effect only such repairs as are most needed if the technical safety of the pits is not to be endangered;
Whereas the investment aid is therefore compatible with Article 7 (1) of the Decision;
Whereas the Belgian Government has also made provision for stockpiling aid totalling Bfrs 467 500 000 for the Campine coalfield ; whereas in 1976 the stocks held by this coalfield reached some 1 300 000 tonnes, of which 800 000 tonnes are to be regarded as qualifying for aid (Article 9 (2) of the Decision) ; whereas the rate of aid per tonne is therefore Bfrs 584 ; whereas costs (including depreciation and interest) can be estimated at Bfrs 640 per tonne ; whereas the stockpiling aid is therefore in accordance with Article 9 of the Decision;
Whereas, lastly, the Belgian Government intends to grant aid totalling Bfrs 4 979 400 000 to cover the pit operating losses of the Belgian coal-mining industry ; whereas the Campine coalfield should receive aid in order to offset part of the difference between costs and returns, coking coal aid of Bfrs 1 606 000 000 having been taken into consideration (Article 12 (5) of the Decision) ; whereas it is necessary for the difference between costs and returns to be covered almost completely because the coalfield helps to guarantee the supply of coking coal to the Community steel industry and must therefore maintain its production ; whereas the purpose and amount of the aid to cover the pit operating losses of the Campine coalfield are therefore in accordance with Article 12 (1) (2) of the Decision;
Whereas, on the other hand, the Sud coalfield should be granted aid in respect of pit operating losses to cover about 80 % of the difference between costs and returns, so that the proposed closure of this coalfield by 1980 can take place without serious economic and social disturbances in the redeployment of the redundant miners ; whereas in 1976 two pits were closed in the Sud coalfield, affecting some 1 500 miners ; whereas the purpose and type of the aids to cover pit operating losses of the Sud coalfield are therefore compatible with Article 12 (1) (2);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 3 (2) of the Decision, all other measures to assist current production in 1976 must be taken into consideration for an examination of the compatibility of the proposed aids with the proper functioning of the common market;

Whereas, on this basis of assessment, the total amount of aid proposed is 177 600 000 European units of account, i.e. 23 768 European units of account per tonne ; whereas this figure is exceptionally high compared with that for the other Member States of the Community;
Whereas the following observations can be made on the compatibility of the proposed current production aids with the proper functioning of the common market:    - owing to the large stockpiles, there were no supply difficulties in 1976;
- there was no adverse effect on trade in coal between Belgium and the other Member States in 1976;
- the closure of two unprofitable pits will result in rationalization and the concentration of production on pits where productivity is highest;
- the prices of Belgian boiler coal in 1976 did not result in indirect aid to industrial consumers of coal;
- in the first half of 1976 the prices of Belgian coking coal matched the prices of US coking coal under long-term contracts;
Whereas there was a development in July 1976 which did not reflect the price trend for US coking coal imported under long-term contracts ; whereas the rebates on the prices of Belgian coking coal granted to the Belgian steel industry were raised in the summer of 1976, although there had been little change in the prices of US coking coal imported under long-term contracts;
Whereas, as a result of the increase in the price rebates in the summer, in the second half of the year the Belgian steel industry paid prices lower than the guide cif price of Bfrs 2335 per tonne set by the Commission;
Whereas, an application having been made for the Campine coalfield (coking coal supplier) for 1976 for investment aid totalling Bfrs 230 000 000, stockpiling aid totalling Bfrs 467 500 000 and loss-covering aid totalling Bfrs 2 250 200 000 pursuant to Decision No 528/76/ECSC and for coking coal aid totalling Bfrs 1 606 000 000 pursuant to Decision 73/287/ECSC, the aids applied for pursuant to Decision No 528/76/ECSC can be approved, this in no way prejudging the examination now in progress under Decision 73/287/ECSC of pricing problems concerning coking coal;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of Decision No 528/76/ECSC, the Commission has to ensure that any aid it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof ; whereas the Commission must therefore be informed in particular of the amount of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '77/624/ECSC: Commission Decision of 23 September 1977 approving aids from the Kingdom of Belgium to the coal- mining industry during the year 1976', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Government of the Kingdom of Belgium is hereby authorized in respect of the calendar year 1976 to grant the following aids to the Belgian coal-mining industry:    (a) for the financing of investment projects:\n\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 230 000 000, Sud coalfield, up to Bfrs 11 300 000;\n\n(b) for the covering of costs of stocks of coal and coke:\n\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 467 500 000;\n\n(c) for the covering of pit operating losses:\n\nCampine coalfield, up to Bfrs 2 250 200 000, Sud coalfield, up to Bfrs 2 729 200 000.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Government of the Kingdom of Belgium shall notify the Commission by 30 November 1977 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amount of the payments made and the manner in which they are apportioned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 September 1977.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nGuido BRUNNER\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION of 14  February 1995 concerning aid granted by the Region of Sardinia (Italy) in the fisheries sector  (temporary withdrawal of vessels) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)  (95/195/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first  subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
After giving notice to the parties concerned, pursuant to the abovementioned Article, to submit  their comments and having regard to those comments,
Having regard to the following:
I
On 24 September 1991, the Italian authorities notified the Commission of Regional Law No 25 of  22 July 1991 (Region of Sardinia) concerning the fisheries sector and containing provisions, inter  alia, on aid to be granted for the temporary withdrawal of fishing vessels. The objectives of the  Law were the creation of conditions permitting biological recovery in the waters around Sardinia  and the adjustment of the capacity of the local fishing fleet to available resources. The fishing  effort was to be reduced, in particular, through the cessation of fishing activities during certain  periods and the payment of compensatory premiums to owners. The budget for the abovementioned  measures for 1991, 1992 and 1993 totalled Lit 57,150 billion.
II
The Commission examined this aspect of the Regional Law in the light of the relevant  provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to  improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector  (1), as amended by Regulation  (EEC) No 3944/90  (2).
Under the Law, the aid for the temporary withdrawal of vessels was granted on the basis of the  following parameters and criteria for vessels which it was found difficult to classify under  Community rules: vessels less than ten years old with a gross registered tonnage of more than 30  tonnes received a daily premium exceeding the amounts laid down in Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No  4028/86 (from 30 to 70 grt: Lit 400  000; 70 to 100 grt: Lit 600  000; more than 100 grt: Lit 900   000). Furthermore, for aid for temporary withdrawal to be considered compatible with the common  market, it was necessary for the premium to be paid, pursuant to Article 23 (2) (a) of Regulation  (EEC) No 4028/86, solely in respect of vessels measuring not less than 12 metres in length between  perpendiculars. The Law in question, however, provided for the payment of premiums for vessels of  less than 4 grt (which are generally less than 12 metres in length) which meant that, in principle,  the measure was not in accordance with the aforementioned provision of Regulation (EEC) No 4029/86.  Consequently, on 14 October 1991, the Commission requested information on the conditions for  granting the premium from the Italian authorities. The Italian Government replied on 12 December  1991 regarding the justification for paying the aid for vessels less than 12 metres long, stating  that these vessels were responsible for overfishing in coastal waters vital for the reproduction  and growth of resources. No argument was put forward, however, in response to the Commission's  other objections, the Italian Government stating only that the measures in question fulfilled a  social need and that the level of the premium had to be sufficient to compensate for the technical  laying-up of the vessels. In view of the lack of information on which to establish that the  measures in question were in accordance with the relevant Community rules, the Commission decided  to open the procedure laid down in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty with regard to the aid and by  letter of 15 January 1992 gave notice to the Italian Government to submit its comments and to amend  the Regional Law in question to bring it into line with Community rules.
III
On 18 February 1992, the Italian Government submitted its comments under the procedure,  saying that the aid was an exceptional measure with a purely local impact and that, consequently,  the effect on competition was very limited. The Italian authorities recognized that the premiums  for temporary withdrawal exceeded the amounts laid down in Community rules and that they did not  comply with the condition laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86. They stressed,  however, that the rates of premium laid down in the Regional Law were maximum levels and that  Article 4 of the Law provided for the application of the rate considered most appropriate by the  authorities. They also pointed out that, because of the structure of the regional fleet (in  particular the age of vesels and the composition of the fleet), the number of undertakings  benefiting from the scheme was extremely small. In addition, almost all Sardinian vessels were more  than ten years old. The Italian authority made no mention of any intention to amend the Law as  requested by the Commission in its letter of 15 january 1992.
By letter dated 9 September 1992, the Italian authorities notified the Commission, under the same  procedure, of a Regional Law of 24 July 1992 amending the Regional Law under examination in order,  according to the explanatory memorandum, to bring it into line with the relevant Community rules.  The draft amendment, however, contained no provision on the length of vessels or on the level of  premiums for temporary withdrawal. The Commission pointed this out to the Italian authorities who,  by letter dated 28 September 1993, submitted the text of a bill bringing the 1991 Regional Law into  line with Community rules. By letter dated 17 November 1993, the Commission confirmed to the  Italian authorities that the position was now in order and that there was no longer any  incompatibility with Community rules. The Commission asked the Italian authorities whether, given  that Regional Law No 25 had been published in 1991, any aid had been paid for temporary withdrawal  before the abovementioned amendment. It also asked whether the legislative amendment was yet in  force. By letter received by the Commission on 21 March 1994, the Italian authorities confirmed  that aid had been paid during 1991, 1992 and 1993 and that, given the criteria applicable during  that period (which were those laid down in Regional Law No 25 of 1991), the amounts laid down in  Community rules had been exceeded. The amounts had, however, been exceeded by a small margin,  namely around Lit 157 million per year solely in 1991 and 1992, corresponding to 0,8  % of the  annual total provided for by Regional Law No 25 of 1991. The Italian authorities also informed the  Commission in the same letter of the adoption of the Law amending Regional Law No 25 of 1991 to  bring it into line with Community rules as demanded in the Commission's letter of 17 November  1993.
By letter dated 21 June 1994, received by the Commission on 27 June 1994, the Italian Government  sent the Commission the text of the Regional Law on the temporary withdrawal of fishing vessels  adopted on 29 April 1994 and published in the Official Journal of the Region of Sardinia of 7 May  1994, bringing Regional Law No 25 of 1991 into line with Community rules. The Law obliged the  regional authorities to apply the rates laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 3699/93 of 21  December 1993 laying down the criteria and arrangements regarding Community structural assistance  in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and the processing and marketing of its products  (1) for  all the measures provided for in the Regulation.
IV
The situation created by the adoption of Regional Law No 25 of 1991 described above must be  examined in the light of all the structural rules applicable under the common fisheries policy. It  should be pointed out that measures should promote the objective of achieving balance between  available resources and the fishing effort. The granting of national aid must be justified in the  light of this objective of the common fisheries policy and the conditions laid down in the relevant  Community rules. The aid in question is likely to affect trade within the Community since the  products covered by the aid are traded within the Community. Furthermore, the conditions laid down  by the relevant Community rules applicable during the period in question - namely Regulation (EEC)  No 4028/86 - concerning the maximum level of laying-up premiums, calculated on the basis of the  tonnage and length of the vessels, were not complied with during the period that Regional Law No 25  of 1991 was in force and actually applied. This situation was not changed by the adoption, during  that period, of an amendment to that Law to bring the regional legal framework into line with the  requirements of Community rules. The measures provided for in Regional Law No 25 of 1991 concerning  the temporary withdrawal of fishing vessels as described above therefore constitute illegal aid.
V
The exceptions to the general incompatibility of the aid set out in Article 92 (2) of the  Treaty do not apply in this case in view of the fact that the scheme introduced by Regional Law No  25 of 1991, as regards the aspects considered in this case, are not within the scope of the said  paragraph.
The same applies with regard to Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
The Italian Government has supplied no information indicating that the scheme introduced by the Law  falls within one of the categories eligible for one of the derogations provided for in Article 92  (3). The measures in question are covered by a Community legal framework which lays down precise  parameters for, in particular, the amounts that can be paid and any financial assistance which is  not in accordance with those parameters strengthens the position of certain operators compared with  their competitors in the Community. The scheme provided for in Regional Law No 25 of 1991 therefore  disturbs or threatens to disturb competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty and  thus none of the derogations provided for in Article 92 (2) and (3) of the Treaty apply to the  scheme.
VI
In conclusion, the aid of Lit 314 million granted under the conditions described above is  illegal, the Italian Government having failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 93 (3) of the  Treaty. Furthermore, the aid is incompatible with the common market because it does not meet the  conditions which are required to benefit from one of the derogations provided for in Article 92 (3)  of the Treaty. The Commission may have recourse to a possibility made available to it by Article 93  (2) of the Treaty and the Court of Justice in its judgment of 12 July 1973 in Case 70/72  (1),  confirmed by its judgment of 24 February 1987 in Case 310/85  (2), and require Member States to  recover from beneficiaries aid which is considered incompatible with the common market.
In this case, the Commission has decided not to demand recovery of the aid owing to the time  elapsing since the scheme was brought to the attention of the Commission and the publication of  this Decision which would be difficult to justify in the light of the judgments of the Court of  Justice concerning procedural time limits  (3),","{'title': '95/195/EC: Commission Decision of 14 February 1995 concerning aid granted by the Region of Sardinia (Italy) in the fisheries sector (temporary withdrawal of vessels) (Only the Italian text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aid amounting to Lit 314 million granted by the Region of  Sardinia in 1991 and 1992 under Regional Law No 25 of 22 July 1991 concerning the temporary  withdrawal of fishing vessels is hereby declared illegal and incompatible with the common market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 14 February 1995.\n\nFor the Commission Emma BONINO Member of the Commission'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 88, and Articles 4, 46, 67 and 86 thereof;
Whereas by Laws No 614 of 22 July 1966, No 1419 of 15 December 1947, No 135 of 16 April 1954, No 623 of 30 July 1959, No 649 of 25 July 1951, No 38 of 15 February 1968 and No 1089 of 25 October 1968 and by Decree No 1523 of 30 June 1967, the Italian Republic has introduced certain measures of aid which include preferential credits, subsidies and tax concessions:
Whereas, under those laws, iron and steel undertakings are eligible for one or more measures of aid in certain circumstances;
Whereas Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits aids to the iron and steel industry, such prohibition extending also to general measures of aid which favour the steel sector in particular;
Whereas State aids amount to actions by a Member State which are liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the steel industry ; whereas Article 67 (1) of the ECSC Treaty provides that such actions must be brought to the knowledge of the High Authority by the State concerned;
Whereas the Commission is responsible for ascertaining whether aids granted by Member States for the iron and steel industry fall under the provisions of Article 4 (c) and, if not, how such aids must be looked upon having regard to the provisions of Article 67 (2) and (3) of the ECSC Treaty;
Whereas Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the Treaty place the Member States under the obligation to supply all relevant information which the Commission needs to carry out its task in a particular sector;
Whereas, if information concerning the aids in question is provided in the form of an annual total, it is not possible to ascertain, for each grant of aid to the iron and steel industry, whether the conditions applied are identical to those applied in respect of other industries to which the same measures of aid are extended;
Whereas the Commission, by letter of 12 March 1970. No 70-22229, requested the Italian Republic to inform it of the measures already taken for the steel industry and of the aid proposed for the iron and steel industry under general aid measures;
Whereas on 13 May 1971 the Commission addressed a further letter, No 71-23837, to the Italian Republic, since the latter had not replied to letter No 70-22229 of 12 March 1970;
Whereas the letter of 13 May 1971 requested the Italian Republic to supply detailed information within two months on aids granted for individual iron and steel investments during 1970 : amount of credit and/or subsidy, duration, rate of interest, deferred amortization, tax concessions;
Whereas the Italian Republic was also requested to provide within two months a list of aids granted to the iron and steel industry and to answer at the same time a number of questions;
Whereas that letter clearly reaffirmed that where general or regional measures of aid in favour of investment projects for the iron and steel industry are applied, the Commission has to be informed thereof ; whereas the Member States cannot escape that obligation on the grounds that general rules cannot be subject to a specific examination having regard to the provisions of the Treaty of Paris;
Whereas the Italian Republic has failed to reply to the Commission's letters of 12 March 1970 and 13 May 1971;
Whereas the Commission had allowed two months for the provision of this information which should be sufficient time for the purpose;
Whereas the failure to communicate the information requested by the Commission in the letters of 12 March 1970 and 13 May 1971 constitutes a failure to fulfil the obligations which devolve upon the Italian Republic under Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the ECSC Treaty;
Whereas by letter No 72-20061 dated 6 January 1972 the Commission invited the Italian Republic in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 88 to furnish, within two months from the date of that letter, its comments with regard to the failure in question;
Whereas the Italian Republic has not replied to the Commission's letter of 6 January 1972;

Having regard to the opinion of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) The maximum residue limit (MRL) for pharmacologically active substances intended for use in the Union in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals or in biocidal products used in animal husbandry is to be established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009.
(2) Pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding MRLs in foodstuffs of animal origin are set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 (2).
(3) Doxycycline is currently included in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 as an allowed substance, for bovine, porcine and poultry species, applicable to muscle, liver and kidney in bovine species, excluding animals producing milk for human consumption, and to muscle, skin and fat, liver and kidney in porcine and poultry species, excluding animals producing eggs for human consumption.
(4) An application for the extension of the existing entry for doxycycline to rabbits has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.
(5) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the establishment of a MRL for doxycycline for rabbits, and the extrapolation of the MRLs for doxycycline from bovine, porcine, poultry and rabbit species to all food-producing species.
(6) The entry for doxycycline in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the MRL for all food-producing species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals producing milk or eggs for human consumption.
(7) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.

Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia(1), and in particular Article 57 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For certain acts adopted by the Commission, which remain valid beyond 1 May 2004, and require adaptation by reason of accession, the necessary adaptations were not provided for in the Act of Accession, in particular in its Annex II. These additional adaptations need to be adopted before accession so as to be applicable as from accession.
(2) The process of enlargement will result in significant movement and change of the land border of the new Community with neighbouring third countries, with the extension of the coastal border to include more sea coast of the Baltic and Mediterranean seas, and with the addition of several international airports.
(3) At the same time as a result of accession the single market will expand to cover much of central Europe, and certain Member States, notably Austria, Germany, and Italy will cease to be the Eastern border of the Community with third countries, and certain of the existing land border inspection posts in these Member States will cease to function as such.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
(1) Whereas the main purpose of the provisions under Directive 92/14/EEC (4) is to restrict the operation of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes;
(2) Whereas a definition of the key elements of the Directive should prevent any ambiguity as to the objective and the scope of the Directive;
(3) Whereas this Directive does not deprive an individual Member State of the possibility of having recourse to the relevant provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access for Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes (5) in accordance with their terms;
(4) Whereas, due to the exceptional historical situation of the airports serving the Berlin conurbation and the location of the airports of Berlin Tegel and Berlin Tempelhof close to the city centre, it is justified to exempt temporarily these two airports from the application of certain provisions of Directive 92/14/EEC;
(5) Whereas it is necessary to respect the initial intention of the exemption for aeroplanes on the registers of developing nations; whereas the relevant provisions of the said Directive should therefore be clarified to that effect;
(6) Whereas an exemption granted for an aeroplane from a developing nation should benefit only that nation;
(7) Whereas it is necessary to clarify the scope for exemptions granted on economic grounds;
(8) Whereas it should be made clear that a Member State can only establish a timetable for the gradual withdrawal of non-compliant aeroplanes in respect of aeroplanes which are on the register of that Member State;
(9) Whereas some Member States have agreements with third country carriers allowing them an exemption for phasing out Chapter 2 aeroplanes similar to that granted to Community air carriers; whereas it is appropriate that these agreements should not be revoked;
(10) Whereas it is essential that the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC be kept up to date and amended in a timely manner; whereas, therefore, amendments should be drawn up by the Commission assisted by a committee of a regulatory nature;
(11) Whereas Article 3 of Directive 92/14/EEC provides for exemptions for aeroplanes on the registers of developing nations and whereas the aeroplanes so exempted were listed in the Annex to that Directive;
(12) Whereas it is necessary to amend the Annex to Directive 92/14/EEC so as to add certain aeroplanes which qualify for an exemption and were not included when that Directive was adopted; whereas it is also necessary to delete all mention of certain aeroplanes that have been withdrawn from service, destroyed or otherwise no longer qualify for the exemption;
(13) Whereas it is essential to prevent wrong usage of registrations; whereas the Annex to this Directive contains, for each aeroplane, reference to the manufacturers' serial number for the individual aeroplane;
(14) Whereas it is important to ensure that infringements of Community law are penalised under conditions which make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive;

(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part(1), provides for certain reciprocal trade concessions for certain agricultural products.
(2) Article 21(5) of the Europe Agreement provides that the Community and Romania is to examine product by product and on an orderly and reciprocal basis the possibilities of granting each other further concessions.
(3) The first improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were provided for in the Protocol for the adaptation of the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement to take into account the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the results of the agricultural negotiations of the Uruguay Round, including improvements to the existing preferential regime, approved by Council Decision 98/626/EC(2).
(4) Improvements to the preferential arrangements were also provided for as a result of negotiations to liberalise agricultural trade concluded in 2000. On the Community side, these were implemented from 1 July 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Romania(3). This second adjustment of the preferential arrangements has not yet been incorporated in the Europe Agreement in the form of an Additional Protocol.
(5) Negotiations for further improvements to the preferential arrangements of the Europe Agreement with Romania were concluded on 18 June 2002.
(6) The new Protocol to the Europe Agreement adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as the Protocol) should be approved with a view to consolidating all concessions in agricultural trade between the two sides, including the results of the negotiations concluded in 2000 and 2002.

(3) Article 4a of Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1048/2005 (4), lays down the conditions under which Member States may apply to the Commission for an extension of the phase-out period laid down in its Article 4(2) and the conditions for granting such an extension.
(4) For some of the active substances for which use in biocidal products shall be prohibited after 1 September 2006, applications for extension of this phase-out period have been submitted by individual Member States to the Commission together with information demonstrating a need for further use of the substances concerned.
(5) Poland has submitted information demonstrating the temporary absence of suitable alternatives to cyfluthrin with regard to its use as an insecticide for the protection of building timber in historical and other constructions. A brief extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate, to allow for efficacy data to be submitted for other alternative substances and their placing on the Polish market to become possible according to national legislation.
(6) France has submitted information demonstrating the need to provide for as wide a spectrum as possible of available larvicides to combat mosquitoes that are vectors of serious diseases affecting the population of the Member State's overseas departments, and requested to maintain temephos on the market of these regions. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate to allow for its replacement by other suitable substances.
(7) France has submitted information demonstrating the need for temporary continuation of the use of ammonia as a veterinary hygiene biocidal product to prevent infections by coccidia, cryptosporidium and nematodes in livestock. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate to permit its gradual replacement by other available substances that are notified for evaluation under the Directive's review programme.

authorising Germany to apply a reduced rate of taxation on electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC
(2014/722/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Implementing Decision 2011/445/EU (2) Germany was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC until 16 July 2014.
(2) By letter dated 26 February 2014, Germany sought the authorisation to continue to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to shore-side electricity pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.
(3) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Germany aims at continuing the promotion of a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.
(4) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the environmental, health and climate policy objectives of the Union.
(5) Allowing Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond what is necessary to increase the use of shore-side electricity, since on-board generation will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the same reason, and because of the current relatively low degree of market penetration of the technology, the measure is unlikely to lead to significant distortions in competition during the time it is applied and will thus not negatively affect the proper functioning of the internal market.
(6) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that provision must be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long enough to allow for the proper evaluation of the measure, but also the need not to undermine future developments of the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of six years.
(7) In order to provide legal certainty to port and ship operators and to avoid a potential increase in the administrative burden for the distributors and redistributors of electricity which could result from changes to the rate of excise duty levied on shore-side electricity, it should be ensured that Germany can apply the existing specific tax reduction to which this Decision relates without interruption. The authorisation requested should therefore be granted with effect from 17 July 2014, in order to follow seamlessly on from the prior arrangements under Council Implementing Decision 2011/445/EU.
(8) This Decision should cease to apply on the date on which general rules on tax advantages for shore-side electricity become applicable by way of a future legislative act of the Union.
(9) This decision is without prejudice to the application of the Union rules regarding State aid,","{'header': '18.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 300/55', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 14 October 2014\nauthorising Germany to apply a reduced rate of taxation on electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\n(2014/722/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Council Implementing Decision 2011/445/EU(2)Germany was authorised to apply a reduced rate of taxation to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC until 16 July 2014.\n\n((2)) By letter dated 26 February 2014, Germany sought the authorisation to continue to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to shore-side electricity pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.\n\n((3)) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Germany aims at continuing the promotion of a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.\n\n((4)) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities.

Whereas this programme is designed to complement action taken at national, regional and local levels, in particular by ensuring an exchange of experience and information relating to such action;
Whereas the main responsibility for integration in the educational field, occupational and economic integration, social integration and an independent way of life for disabled people lies with the Member States but cooperative action at Community level  may help Member States to improve the effectiveness of the measures which they take in this area;
Whereas the Community Charter of the fundamental social rights of workers, adopted at the European Council in Strasbourg on 9 December 1989 by the Heads of State or Government of 11 Member States, proclaims inter alia, in point 26:
'26. All disabled persons, whatever the origin and nature of their disability, must be entitled to additional concrete measures aimed at improving their social and professional integration.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter of 4 March 2010, Sweden sought authorisation to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (shore-side electricity) pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.
(2) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Sweden aims to promote a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.
(3) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities. Under the specific conditions of the electricity generation structure in the region concerned, i.e. the Nordic electricity market including Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway, the use of electricity from the onshore grid instead of electricity generated by burning bunker fuels on board is furthermore expected to avoid CO2 emissions. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the Union’s environmental, health and climate policy objectives.
(4) Allowing Sweden to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the above mentioned objective, since on-board generation will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the same reason, and because of the current relatively low degree of market penetration of the technology, the measure is unlikely to lead to significant distortions in competition during its lifetime and will thus not negatively affect the proper functioning of the internal market.
(5) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that provision is to be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long enough in order not to discourage port operators from making the necessary investments, but also the need not to undermine future developments of the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of 3 years, subject however to the entry into application of general provisions in the matter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen,","{'header': '30.6.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 170/36', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 20 June 2011\nauthorising Sweden to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\n(2011/384/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter of 4 March 2010, Sweden sought authorisation to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (shore-side electricity) pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.\n\n((2)) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Sweden aims to promote a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.\n\n((3)) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (1), as last amended by Directive 88/380/EEC (2), and in particular Article 15 (7) thereof,
Having regard to the applications lodged by Greece,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Directive 70/457/EEC, seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted in 1986 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the Directive is, with effect from 31 December 1988, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to the variety in the Community;
Whereas the same applies to seed of certain varieties of cotton (Gossypium spp.) officially accepted in Spain before 1986, by virtue of Articles 2 and 394 (1) of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of Directive 70/457/EEC provides that, in the cases set out in Article 15 (3), a Member State may be authorized, upon application, to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas, moreover, Article 15 (7) of Directive 70/457/EEC provides that:
- the period ending on 31 December 1988 may be extended before expiry where there is good reason (first subparagraph),
- with regard to Greece and in respect of applications submitted by that Member State not later than 31 December 1985 and made on the grounds referred to in Article 15 (3) (c), second alternative, that period may be extended to 30 June 1989 (second subparagraph);
Whereas Greece has applied for authorizations pursuant to Article 15 (2) of Directive 70/457/EEC in respect of certain varieties of cotton and soya bean (Glycine max) including varieties of cotton officially accepted in Spain before 1986;
Whereas it is impossible to complete before 31 December 1988 the examination of the application submitted by Greece in respect of the cotton varieties Jerez, Palma 76 and Tabladilla 100;
Whereas in respect of the cotton varieties Acala SJ-1, Acala SJ-2, C 210, C 312, Macnair 220, Promese and Stroman 254, Greece has not been able, for reasons for which it is not entirely responsible, to justify its application;
Whereas, for Greece, in the case of these 10 cotton varieties, the period mentioned above should accordingly be extended, pursuant to Article 15 (7), first subparagraph, of Directive 70/457/EEC in order to allow complete examination of the applications;
Whereas the application of Greece in respect of soya bean varieties relates to early varieties and is based on Article 15 (3) (c), second alternative of Directive 70/457/EEC, namely that it is well known that such varieties are not at present suitable for cultivation in Greece;
Whereas, for Greece, in the case of these soya bean varieties, it is appropriate to extend the said period until 30 June 1989, pursuant to Article 15 (7), second suparagraph, of Directive 70/457/EEC, in order to allow complete examination of the application;

on information to be published on a regular basis by companies the shares of which have been admitted to official stock-exchange listing
(82/121/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 54 (3) (g) and 100 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Council Directive 80/390/EEC of 17 March 1980 coordinating the requirements for the drawing up, scrutiny and distribution of the listing particulars to be published for the admission of securities to official stock-exchange listing (4) seeks to ensure improved protection of investors and a greater degree of equivalence in the protection provided, by coordinating requirements as to the information to be published at the time of admission;
Whereas, in the case of securities admitted to official stock-exchange listing, the protection of investors requires that the latter be supplied with appropriate regular information throughout the entire period during which the securities are listed; whereas coordination of requirements for this regular information has similar objectives to those envisaged for the listing particulars, namely to improve such protection and to make it more equivalent, to facilitate the listing of these securities on more than one stock exchange in the Community, and in so doing to contribute towards the establishment of a genuine Community capital market by permitting a fuller interpenetration of securities markets;
Whereas, under Council Directive 79/279/EEC of 5 March 1979 coordinating the conditions for the admission of securities to official stock-exchange listing (5), listed companies must as soon as possible make available to investors their annual accounts and report giving information on the company for the whole of the financial year; whereas the fourth Directive 78/660/EEC (6) has coordinated the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the annual accounts of certain types of companies;
Whereas companies should also, at least once during each financial year, make available to investors reports on their activities; whereas this Directive can, consequently, be confined to coordinating the content and distribution of a single report covering the first six months of the financial year;
Whereas, however, in the case of ordinary debentures, because of the rights they confer on their holders, the protection of investors by means of the publication of a half-yearly report is not essential; whereas, by virtue
of Directive 79/279/EEC, convertible or exchangeable debentures and debentures with warrants may be admitted to official listing only if the related shares are already listed on the same stock exchange or on another regulated, regularly operating, recognized open market or are so admitted simultaneously; whereas the Member States may derogate from this principle only if their competent authorities are satisfied that holders have at their disposal all the information necessary to form an opinion concerning the value of the shares to which these debentures relate; whereas, consequently, regular information needs to be coordinated only for companies whose shares are admitted to official stock-exchange listing;
Whereas the half-yearly report must enable investors to make an informed appraisal of the general development of the company's activities during the period covered by the report; whereas, however, this report need contain only the essential details on the financial position and general progress of the business of the company in question;
Whereas, in order to take account of difficulties resulting from the current state of laws in certain Member States, companies may be allowed a longer period to implement the provisions of this Directive than that laid down for the adaptation of national laws;
Whereas, so as to ensure the effective protection of investors and the proper operation of stock exchanges, the rules relating to regular information to be published by companies, the shares of which are admitted to official stock-exchange listing within the Community, should apply not only to companies from Member States, but also to companies from non-member countries","{'title': 'Council Directive 82/121/EEC of 15 February 1982 on information to be published on a regular basis by companies the shares of which have been admitted to official stock-exchange listing', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1163/2002(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1324/2002(5).
(3) As far as wheat and rye flour, groats and meal are concerned, when the refund on these products is being calculated, account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture. These quantities were fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil.
(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For ethoprophos and pirimiphos-methyl the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 19 January 2004 and 4 November 2003 respectively. For fipronil, the rapporteur Member State was France and all relevant information was submitted on 10 February 2004.
(3) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 3 March 2006 for ethoprophos, on 10 August 2005 for pirimiphos-methyl, on 3 March 2006 for fipronil, in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports (4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 16 March 2007 in the format of the Commission review reports for ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil.
(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points concerning ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for some issues and that such studies should be presented by the notifiers.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '17.8.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 214/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2007/52/EC\nof 16 August 2007\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include ethoprophos, pirimiphos-methyl and fipronil as active substances\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 703/2001(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 16(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1429/95 (2) set implementing rules for export refunds on products processed from fruit and vegetables other than those granted for added sugar.
(2) Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 states that to the extent necessary to permit exportation of economically significant quantities export refunds can be granted on the products listed at Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty. Article 18(4) of that Regulation provides that if the refund on the sugar incorporated in the products listed in Article 1(2)(b) is insufficient to allow exportation of these products the refund set in line with Article 17 thereof shall apply to them.
(3) Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that it be ensured that trade flows that have already arisen as a result of granting of export refunds are not disturbed. For that reason the quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3).
(4) Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when refunds are set account is taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability on the Community market of products processed from fruit and vegetables and for international trade prices, of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged.
(5) Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when prices on the Community market are determined account is taken of the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation.
(6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to differentiate the refund on a given product by destination.
(7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of provisionally preserved cherries, peeled tomatoes, sugar-preserved cherries, prepared hazelnuts and certain orange juices.
(8) Export refund rates and quantities should therefore be set for these products.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,","{'header': '16.10.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 271/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1204/2007\nof 15 October 2007\nsetting export refunds in the processed fruit and vegetable sector other than those granted on added sugar (provisionally preserved cherries, peeled tomatoes, sugar-preserved cherries, prepared hazelnuts, certain orange juices)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1429/95(2)set implementing rules for export refunds on products processed from fruit and vegetables other than those granted for added sugar.\n\n((2)) Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 states that to the extent necessary to permit exportation of economically significant quantities export refunds can be granted on the products listed at Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular Article 4(2), first subparagraph thereof,
After consulting the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/95/EC obliges producers to place only safe products on the market.
(2) Under Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, a product is presumed to be safe, as far as the risks and risk categories covered by the relevant national standards are concerned, when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards, the references of which have to be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union, in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Directive.
(3) Pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Directive, European standards should be established by European standardisation bodies under mandates drawn up by the Commission. The Commission will publish the references of such standards.
(4) Article 4(2) of the Directive lays down a procedure for the publication of references of standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies before the entry into force of the Directive. Where such standards ensure compliance with the general safety requirement, the Commission will decide to publish the references in the Official Journal of the European Union. In such cases, the Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, will decide, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15(2) of the Directive, whether the standard in question meets the general safety requirement. The Commission will decide to publish the reference of the standard after consulting the Committee established by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. The Commission will notify the Member States of its decision.
(5) Baby walking frames are devices that help pre-ambulatory children to move around on their own. Hospital emergency data from both Europe and the US over the last 20 years, however, consistently show that baby walking frames are a fall hazard, because they increase the mobility and the speed of children who are not yet able to stand or walk on their own.
(6) Accidents using baby walking frames are mainly due to falling down stairs or tipping over, especially when children try to go over uneven surfaces such as door thresholds or carpet edges. Injuries resulting from such accidents are very serious, because, in the majority of cases, they affect the child’s head.
(7) In September 1997, the Commission issued a mandate (3) to CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) to address the specific safety risks due to the increased mobility and speed provided by baby walking frames to pre-ambulatory children in the relevant standard that CEN was developing at that time.
(8) The Commission considered the first version of standard EN 1273 adopted by CEN in 2001 not to be satisfactory, since the standard did not address the specific risks described in the mandate.
(9) The revised version of EN standard 1273 of May 2005, however, provides for stability tests and design requirements geared to reducing injuries caused by falling down stairs and tipping over, as requested in the Commission’s mandate.
(10) EN 1273:2005 is widely used by the market surveillance authorities in the Member States, as confirmed by several RAPEX notifications making reference to this standard. Furthermore, some Members States refer to this standard in their legislation on the safety of child-care articles (4).
(11) The improved safety against falling down steps and tipping over provided by EN 1273:2005 increases the passive prevention of accidents arising from the use of baby walking frames.
(12) The Commission considers that EN 1273:2005 complies with the general safety requirement. As the standard was adopted under a mandate issued before the entry into force of Directive 2001/95/EC, the reference of EN 1273:2005 should be published in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 4(2), first subparagraph.
(13) This Decision on the compliance of EN standard 1273:2005 with the general safety requirement is taken at the initiative of the Commission.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee of Directive 2001/95/EC,","{'header': '13.1.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 8/29', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 December 2008\non the compliance of standard EN 1273:2005 on baby walking frames with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and publication of the reference of the standard in the Official Journal\n(notified under document number C(2008) 8616)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/18/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/95/EC obliges producers to place only safe products on the market.\n\n((2)) Under Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, a product is presumed to be safe, as far as the risks and risk categories covered by the relevant national standards are concerned, when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards, the references of which have to be published by the Commission in theOfficial Journal of the European Union, in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Directive.\n\n((3)) Pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Directive, European standards should be established by European standardisation bodies under mandates drawn up by the Commission.
