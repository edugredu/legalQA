Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (3), and in particular Article 106 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Council may authorise Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services, which must meet the conditions provided for in Directive 2006/112/EC and be included in the list given in Annex IV thereto.
(2) Directive No 2006/112/EC extended the period of application of the reduced rates of VAT until 31 December 2010. It enables Member States, both those wishing to avail themselves for the first time of the facility provided for, and those wishing to change the list of services to which they have applied the said provision in the past, to submit their request to the Commission.
(3) This is intended to make it possible for all Member States to take part under the same conditions in the trial of reduced rates for labour-intensive services. It is therefore appropriate to grant the acceding States, from their accession to the European Union, the same possibility of applying a reduced rate of VAT to certain labour-intensive services.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) In June 2001, the Commission adopted Decisions 2001/527/EC(1) and 2001/528/EC(2) setting up the Committee of European Securities Regulators and the European Securities Committee respectively.
(2) In its Resolutions of 5 February and 21 November 2002, the European Parliament endorsed the four-level approach advocated in the Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of European securities markets and called for certain aspects of that approach to be extended to the banking and insurance sectors subject to a clear Council commitment to reform to guarantee a proper institutional balance.
(3) On 3 December 2002, the Council invited the Commission to implement such arrangements in the fields of banking and insurance and occupational pensions and to establish as soon as possible new committees in an advisory capacity in relation to those fields.
(4) An independent body for reflection, debate and advice for the Commission in the field of banking regulation and supervision should be established.
(5) That body, to be called the Committee of European Banking Supervisors, hereinafter referred to as ""the Committee"", should also contribute to the consistent and timely application of Community legislation in the Member States and to the convergence of supervisory practices throughout the Community.
(6) The Committee should promote cooperation in the banking field, such as the exchange of information.
(7) The establishment of the Committee should be without prejudice to the organisation of banking supervision at either national or Community level.
(8) The composition of the Committee should reflect the organisation of banking supervision and should also take account of the role of central banks as regards the overall stability of the banking sector at national and Community level. The respective rights of the different categories of participants should be clearly identified. In particular, chairmanship and voting rights should be reserved to the competent supervisory authorities of each Member State; and participation in confidential discussions about individual supervised institutions should, where appropriate, be restricted to the competent supervisory authorities and to the central banks entrusted with specific operational responsibilities for supervision of the individual credit institutions concerned.
(9) The Committee should organise its own operational arrangements and maintain close operational links with the Commission and the Committee established by Commission Decision 2004/10/EC of 5 November 2003 establishing a European Banking Committee(3).
(10) The Committee should cooperate with the other committees in the financial sector, in particular with the Committee established by Decision 2004/10/EC, with the Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of Central Banks and with the Groupe de Contact of European banking supervisors. In particular, it should be possible for the Committee to invite observers from other committees in the banking and financial sector.
(11) The Committee should, at an early stage, consult extensively and in an open and transparent manner with market participants, consumers and end-users.
(12) Whenever the Committee provides advice on provisions applicable to both credit institutions and investment firms, it should consult those authorities competent for the supervision of investment firms which are not already represented on the Committee,","{'title': '2004/5/EC: Commission Decision of 5 November 2003 establishing the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn independent advisory group on banking supervision in the Community, called ""the Committee of European Banking Supervisors"" (hereinafter ""the Committee"") is established.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThe role of the Committee shall be to advise the Commission either at the Commission's request, within a time limit which the Commission may lay down according to the urgency of the matter, or on the Committee's own initiative, in particular as regards the preparation of draft implementing measures in the field of banking activities.\n\nThe Committee shall contribute to the consistent application of Community directives and to the convergence of Member States' supervisory practices throughout the Community.\n\nIt shall enhance supervisory cooperation, including the exchange of information on individual supervised institutions.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe Committee shall be composed of high level representatives from the following organisations:\n\n(a) the national public authorities competent for the supervision of credit institutions, hereinafter ""the competent supervisory authorities"";\n\n(b) the national central banks entrusted with specific operational responsibilities for the supervision of individual credit institutions alongside a competent supervisory authority;\n\n(c) the central banks which are not directly involved in the supervision of individual credit institutions, including the European Central Bank.\n\nEach Member State shall designate high level representatives to participate in the meetings of the Committee.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Articles 3(5) and 16(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In some preparations, authorised as additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, technological additives and other substances or products are incorporated to exert a function on the active substance contained in the preparation, such as stabilising or standardising it, facilitating its handling or its incorporation into feed. For example, those technological additives or other substances or products may increase flowability or homogeneity or reduce the dusting potential of the active substance. The specific composition of authorised additives consisting of preparations will therefore vary according to the rationale for the use of those preparations. The technological additives or other substances or products added to maintain the integrity of an active substance are however not intended to perform a function in the feed in which the preparation is to be incorporated.
(2) Taking into account that technological progress contributes to the development of new preparations, it is appropriate to better consider the specificities of additives consisting of preparations and to bring more transparency and clarity when placing them on the market, without affecting intellectual property rights relating to the composition of premixtures containing such additives.
(3) In particular, it is appropriate to introduce into Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 additional labelling requirements for this type of additives and for premixtures containing them, so as to allow a verification that technological additives used in a preparation are authorised for the intended purpose and that those additives exert a function only on the active substance contained in the preparation.
(4) While the most relevant information should be kept on the packaging or container of the additive or the premixture, technological progress also allows providing information about the composition of the preparations in a more flexible and less costly way via other written means. This is in compliance with the definition of labelling provided for in Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2).
(5) Operators should be able to provide information about the composition of the preparations which are placed on the market since such information enables the end-user or the purchaser to make an informed choice, allows appropriate risk assessment and contributes to fairness of transactions.
(6) Those additional labelling and information requirements should apply only to additives belonging to the categories referred to in Article 6(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Where such additives are authorised as preparations, only the active substance is indeed the subject of the authorisation, and not the other components of the preparations, which may vary.
(7) In order to prevent any undesirable effects on human health, animal health or the environment, operators should ensure that there is physico-chemical and biological compatibility between the components of the preparation which is placed on the market and used.
(8) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, on specific labelling requirements for certain additives and for premixtures, and Annex IV thereto, on general conditions of use, should therefore be amended in order to take into account technological progress and scientific development concerning additives consisting of preparations.
(9) A transitional period is needed to avoid disruptions in the placing on the market and use of existing additives consisting of preparations, and of feed containing them, so that they may be used until stocks are exhausted.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 203 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) Greenland is included in the list of overseas countries and territories set out in Annex II to the Treaties. In accordance with Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘the Treaty’), the purpose of the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union is to promote the economic and social development of the overseas countries and territories and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole.
(2) Denmark and Greenland have requested that veterinary checks between the Union and Greenland on fishery products, bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods, by-products and products derived from these by-products that are regarded as originating in Greenland according to Annex III to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (‘Overseas Association Decision’) (1), and of the same products which are introduced into Greenland from third countries, be permitted in accordance with the rules on sanitary and veterinary controls applicable to trade within the Union.
(3) Trade in those products between Greenland and the Union should, therefore, be conducted in compliance with Union rules on animal health and food safety. Accordingly, Denmark and Greenland should undertake to ensure that consignments of products dispatched to the Union from Greenland are in conformity with the applicable Union rules concerning animal health and food safety. In particular, eligible feed and food business operators should be registered and listed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(4) Veterinary checks at border inspection posts in Greenland should be carried out in accordance with Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (3). Veterinary checks at border inspection posts should be carried out in close cooperation with customs officials. To simplify those tasks it is appropriate to provide the competent authorities with references to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) specified in Annex I to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC of 17 April 2007 concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC (4).
(5) The competent authority in Greenland should provide official assurances to the Commission on the enforcement of the Union rules and animal health requirements for the products concerned. Those assurances should cover, in particular, compliance with the applicable provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1069/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 laying down health rules as regards animal by-products and derived products not intended for human consumption (5), Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (6) and Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (7). Those assurances should also include a commitment to ensure compliance with the rules on trade within the Union.
(6) Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products (8) requires the establishment of national monitoring plans for aquaculture animals. Accordingly, those provisions should also apply to Greenland.
(7) In order to permit importation of the products covered by this Decision into the Union from Greenland in accordance with the rules on trade within the Union laid down in Union legal acts, as well as to ensure the sanitary safety of the products concerned, Denmark and Greenland should undertake to transpose and implement the relevant provisions of Union laws in Greenland, before the date from which this Decision should apply.
(8) Denmark and Greenland should also undertake to ensure that imports into Greenland from third countries of the products concerned comply with Union rules on animal health and food safety.
(9) Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (9) provides for the introduction of a computerised system linking veterinary authorities, with a view, in particular, to facilitate the rapid exchange of information relating to animal health and welfare between the competent authorities (Traces). Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system (10) provides that the Member States are to use Traces from 1 April 2004. Traces is essential for the effective monitoring of trade in animals and products of animal origin and accordingly, it should be used for the transmission of data on movements and trade in such products between Greenland and the Union.
(10) Outbreaks of animal diseases listed in Council Directive 82/894/EEC of 21 December 1982 on the notification of animal diseases within the Community (11), are to be reported to the Commission through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) in accordance with Commission Decision 2005/176/EC of 1 March 2005 laying down the codified form and the codes for the notification of animal diseases pursuant to Directive 82/894/EEC (12). For the products concerned, those provisions should also apply to Greenland.
(11) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (13) established a rapid alert system for the notification of a direct or indirect risk to human health deriving from food or feed. Those provisions should also apply to Greenland for the products concerned.
(12) Before Greenland can carry out veterinary checks on products that are introduced into Greenland from third countries, a Union inspection should be carried out in Greenland in order to verify that one or more border inspection posts in Greenland are in compliance with the requirements laid down in Directive 97/78/EC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 136/2004 of 22 January 2004 laying down procedures for veterinary checks at Community border inspection posts on products imported from third countries (14) and Commission Decision 2001/812/EC of 21 November 2001 laying down the requirements for the approval of border inspection posts responsible for veterinary checks on products introduced into the Community from third countries (15).
(13) In the event that the results of such an inspection are positive, one or more border inspection posts in Greenland should be listed in Commission Decision 2009/821/EC of 28 September 2009 drawing up a list of approved border inspection posts, laying down certain rules on the inspections carried out by Commission veterinary experts and laying down the veterinary units in Traces (16). In order to ensure effective control of the products covered by this Decision introduced in Greenland and in the Union, it is appropriate that this Decision apply as from the moment at which one or more border inspection posts in Greenland are listed in Decision 2009/821/EC.

In accordance with Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘the Treaty’), the purpose of the association of the overseas countries and territories with the Union is to promote the economic and social development of the overseas countries and territories and to establish close economic relations between them and the Union as a whole.\n\n((2)) Denmark and Greenland have requested that veterinary checks between the Union and Greenland on fishery products, bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods, by-products and products derived from these by-products that are regarded as originating in Greenland according to Annex III to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (‘Overseas Association Decision’)(1), and of the same products which are introduced into Greenland from third countries, be permitted in accordance with the rules on sanitary and veterinary controls applicable to trade within the Union.\n\n((3)) Trade in those products between Greenland and the Union should, therefore, be conducted in compliance with Union rules on animal health and food safety. Accordingly, Denmark and Greenland should undertake to ensure that consignments of products dispatched to the Union from Greenland are in conformity with the applicable Union rules concerning animal health and food safety. In particular, eligible feed and food business operators should be registered and listed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules(2).\n\n((4)) Veterinary checks at border inspection posts in Greenland should be carried out in accordance with Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(3). Veterinary checks at border inspection posts should be carried out in close cooperation with customs officials. To simplify those tasks it is appropriate to provide the competent authorities with references to the Combined Nomenclature (CN) specified in Annex I to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC of 17 April 2007 concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC(4).\n\n((5)) The competent authority in Greenland should provide official assurances to the Commission on the enforcement of the Union rules and animal health requirements for the products concerned.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 613/98 (2), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas thiabendazole, flubendazole, thiamphenicol, doxycycline and oxibendazole should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas sodium selenite, sodium selenate and potassium selenate should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851 /EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

","21.5.2010 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 125/48
COUNCIL DECISION
of 19 January 2010
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Slovakia
(2010/290/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, Article 126(6) in conjunction with Article 126(13) and Article 136 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Slovakia,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 also establishes provisions for the implementation of Article 104 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, required the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considered that an excessive deficit in a Member State existed or might occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit existed in Slovakia. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Slovakia on 11 November 2009 (3).
(6) Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Slovakia, this overall assessment leads to the conclusions set out in this Decision.
(7) According to data notified by the Slovak authorities in October 2009, the general government deficit in Slovakia is planned to reach 6,3 % of GDP in 2009, thus exceeding and not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value. The planned excess over the reference value can be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it results, among other things, from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission services’ 2009 autumn forecast projects real GDP to contract by 5,8 % in 2009. While the excess over the 3 % reference value mainly reflects the severity of the economic downturn, it also results from the significant deterioration of the structural balance since 2005. Furthermore, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the Commission services’ 2009 forecast projects the general government deficit to reach 6 % of GDP in 2010 based on the no-policy change assumption. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) According to data notified by the Slovak authorities in October 2009, the general government gross debt remains well below the 60 % of GDP reference value and is planned to stand at around 30 % of GDP in 2009. According to the Commission services’ autumn forecast, the debt ratio is set to increase rapidly, reaching 42,7 % of GDP in 2011 under the no policy change assumption.
(9) In line with the provisions in the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission in its report gave due consideration to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully-funded pillar. While the implementation of these reforms leads to a temporary deterioration of the budgetary position, the long-term sustainability of public finances clearly improves. Based on the estimates of the Slovak authorities, the net costs of this reform amount to 1,1 % of GDP in 2009-2011, rising to 1,2 % in 2012. According to the Stability and Growth Pact, these can be taken into account on a linear degressive basis for a transitory period and only in case the deficit remains close to the reference value. Since the deficit does not remain close to the reference value in 2009-2011, the cost of the pension reform cannot be taken into account.
(10) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Slovakia, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '21.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/48', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 19 January 2010\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Slovakia\n(2010/290/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

In particular, it results, among other things, from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission services’ 2009 autumn forecast projects real GDP to contract by 5,8\xa0% in 2009. While the excess over the 3\xa0% reference value mainly reflects the severity of the economic downturn, it also results from the significant deterioration of the structural balance since 2005. Furthermore, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the Commission services’ 2009 forecast projects the general government deficit to reach 6\xa0% of GDP in 2010 based on the no-policy change assumption. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.\n\n((8)) According to data notified by the Slovak authorities in October 2009, the general government gross debt remains well below the 60\xa0% of GDP reference value and is planned to stand at around 30\xa0% of GDP in 2009. According to the Commission services’ autumn forecast, the debt ratio is set to increase rapidly, reaching 42,7\xa0% of GDP in 2011 under the no policy change assumption.\n\n((9)) In line with the provisions in the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission in its report gave due consideration to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully-funded pillar. While the implementation of these reforms leads to a temporary deterioration of the budgetary position, the long-term sustainability of public finances clearly improves. Based on the estimates of the Slovak authorities, the net costs of this reform amount to 1,1\xa0% of GDP in 2009-2011, rising to 1,2\xa0% in 2012. According to the Stability and Growth Pact, these can be taken into account on a linear degressive basis for a transitory period and only in case the deficit remains close to the reference value. Since the deficit does not remain close to the reference value in 2009-2011, the cost of the pension reform cannot be taken into account.\n\n((10)) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Slovakia, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Slovakia.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Slovak Republic.'}]}"

of 18 September 2000
amending Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating in Malaysia
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission, after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. EXISTING MEASURES
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1001/97(2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating in Malaysia. The rate of the duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is 32,5 % except for the company Hualon Corporation (M) Sdn. Bhd. (Hualon), for which a 16,4 % rate applies.
B. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(2) The Malaysian exporting producer, Hualon Corporation (M) Sdn. Bhd., lodged a request for an interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to it limited to the aspects of dumping pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the ""basic Regulation""). The request alleged that changed circumstances of a lasting nature have led to a stable or slightly reduced normal value and a considerable increase of its export price so that the continued imposition of measures to it was no longer necessary to counteract dumping. Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of an interim review the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) and commenced an investigation.
C. PROCEDURE
(3) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1998 until 30 June 1999 (hereinafter referred to as the ""investigation period"").
(4) The Commission officially advised the authorities of the exporting country of the initiation of the interim review and gave all parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(5) The Commission sent a questionnaire and received detailed information from the exporting producer concerned.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the exporting producer concerned.
(7) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1001/97, and were given an opportunity to comment. Their comments were taken into account and, where appropriate, the findings were modified accordingly.
D. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT
1. Product under consideration
(8) The product under consideration is the same as in the previous investigation, i.e. polyester textured filament yarn (hereinafter referred to as ""PTY""). PTY is directly derived from partially oriented polyester yarn, and is used in both the weaving and the knitting sectors to make polyester or polyester/cotton fabrics. The product is currently classifiable within CN code 5402 33 00. It should be noted, however, that Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 refers to CN codes 5402 33 10 and 5402 33 90 which were applicable for the product classification at the time that Regulation was published.
(9) There are different types of PTY, depending on the weight (""denier""), the number of filaments and the lustre. There are also different qualities, depending on the efficiency of the production process. However, no significant differences exist in the basic characteristics and uses of the different types and qualities of PTY. All types of PTY have been and are considered as one product for the purposes of this investigation.
2. Like product
(10) As in the previous investigation, this investigation has shown that the PTY produced in Malaysia by Hualon and sold on the Malaysian market or exported to the Community has the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses, and therefore, is to be considered a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
E. DUMPING
1. Normal value
(11) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, it was first established whether Hualon's total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, this was found to be the case since domestic sales volume of Hualon was at least 5 % of its total sales volume to the Community.
(12) For each of the types sold by Hualon on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable to the ten types sold for export to the Community, it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. This was considered to be the case when, during the investigation period, the total domestic sales volume of a type represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the same type exported to the Community.
(13) For those product types meeting the 5 % test, an examination was also made as to whether the domestic sales of each of these types could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of sales to independent customers of the type in question not made at a loss. In cases where sales of a type, not made at a loss, represented more than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type, normal value was based on a weighted average price of all domestic sales made during the investigation period. In cases where the volume of sales, not made at a loss, of a type represented at least 10 %, but less than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type, normal value was based on a weighted average price of the sales not made at a loss only.
(14) As a result of the methodology set out above, normal value for five types of PTY exported to the Community during the investigation period could be based on the domestic selling prices of comparable types of PTY.
(15) For the remaining five product types exported to the Community during the investigation period, it was found that the volume of domestic sales was lower than 5 % of the volume exported to the Community. Thus, domestic sales of the five product types were considered insufficient within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. For these types, normal value was constructed on the basis of the costs of manufacturing incurred by Hualon for the exported product type in question plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs (""SG &  A"") and profits in accordance with Article 2(3) and (6) of the basic Regulation. The SG &  A were based on Hualon's domestic sales of the like product. The profit margin was based on the Hualon's domestic sales of the like product made in the ordinary course of trade.
(16) Hualon claimed that in calculating constructed normal value the profit of profitable domestic sales of certain types which were also exported to the Community should only be used. The claim was rejected because Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation provides that profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary course of trade of the like product.
2. Export price
(17) Since all export sales of the product under consideration were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the prices paid or payable.
3. Comparison
(18) For the purposes of a fair comparison by type on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade, due allowance was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability. These adjustments were made in respect of transport, insurance, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit and commissions in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
4. Dumping margin
(19) The comparison was made between the weighted average normal value per product type and the weighted average export price for the same product type, in accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation.
(20) The comparison as described above showed the existence of dumping for the company concerned. Due to the varying dumping margins of the different product types, an overall weighted average dumping margin was established in accordance with Article 2(12) of the basic Regulation. The dumping margin established, expressed as a percentage of the total cif value at Community frontier level, duty unpaid, is 3,2 %.
(21) The dumping margin of this investigation, however, is considerably lower in comparison with the dumping margin established for the company concerned during the previous investigation, which amounted to 16,4 %.
F. LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES
(22) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, it was examined whether the changed circumstances that have led to the decrease of the dumping margin could be reasonably said to be of lasting nature. In this respect, it was found in particular that the production of PTY over the period 1996 to the investigation period has decreased considerably as raw materials were diverted to new production lines of other polyester yarns. Also, internal consumption of PTY increased significantly over the same period as it was directed to increase the production of products with higher added value. These two changes have decreased the volume of sales (domestic and export) of the product concerned significantly over the same period. These changes in the production and sales policies of the company are viewed as evidence that it is unlikely that there will be a recurrence of dumped exports at levels similar to those established in the previous investigation.
G. AMENDMENT OF MEASURES
(23) In view of the finding of a lower dumping margin for the company concerned and as this situation is not considered to be of a short-term nature, measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 on exports of this company should be amended by amending that Regulation accordingly.
(24) This review does not affect the date on which the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) 1001/97 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1992/2000 of 18 September 2000 amending Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester textured filament yarn originating in Malaysia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 shall be replaced by the following:', 'text': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/97 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n""Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (1), and in particular points (a) and (c) of Article 187 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) provides for preferential arrangements for 2014 as regards the customs duties for the import of certain goods originating in Ukraine. In accordance with Article 3 of that Regulation the agricultural products listed in Annex III thereto are to be admitted for import into the Union within the limits of the tariff quotas as set out in that Annex. The quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with Article 184(2)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013.
(2) Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 includes tariff quotas for milk and milk products. It is necessary to include those quotas in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 (3) and to insert in Article 19 of that Regulation a reference to the relevant rule on the proof of origin which is required to import under those quotas.
(3) Since the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are open only until 31 October 2014, the period of lodging import licence applications and the period of validity of import licences should be specified.
(4) According to Article 10(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, importers approved in May 2013 can import under quotas only during the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014. As the quotas opened for Ukraine are exceptionally running over two consecutive six-months periods, approved importers could only import until 30 June 2014 whilst the concerned quotas are open until 31 October 2014. It is therefore appropriate to enable those importers to import under the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 until 31 October 2014.
(5) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1001/2013 (4), has replaced some CN codes in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (5) by new CN codes which now differ from those referred to in Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. The new CN codes should therefore be reflected in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Since the quotas referred to in Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 are open only until 31 October 2014, this Regulation should enter into force as soon as possible.

Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

The fibres form a flexible, spongy body of even thickness, and are readily separable and ‘pluckable’.\nWithin the cylinder, the components are placed in the following order:\n—\nC (approximately 6\xa0mm long),\n—\nI (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nT (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nA (approximately 13\xa0mm long),\n—\nT (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nI (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nC (approximately12\xa0mm long),\n—\nI (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nT (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nA (approximately. 13\xa0mm long),\n—\nT (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nI (approximately 10\xa0mm long),\n—\nC (approximately 6\xa0mm long).\nThe percentage by weight of the different materials in the article is as follows:\n—\nC: approximately 17\xa0%,\n—\nI: approximately 16\xa0%,\n—\nA: approximately 8\xa0%,\n—\nT: approximately 41\xa0%,\n—\npaper: approximately 18\xa0%.\nThe article is designed to be cut up and to be used in the production of filter cigarettes. It is not evident from the objective characteristics of the article how it will be cut up.\n(See photographs nos. 664\xa0A and B)\n(\n*1\n)\n5601\xa022\xa010\nClassification is determined by General Rules 1, 4 and 6 for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature (GIR) and the wording of CN codes 5601 , 5601\xa022  and 5601\xa022\xa010 .\nThe article contains more filtering than tobacco components. The tobacco may remain placed between two filters and hence may not be combusted but only used as a flavouring component in a cigarette. The tobacco constitutes only approximately one third of the volume of the article. Consequently, the different filters give the article its essential character within the meaning of GIR 3(b).\nThe plain cellulose acetate fibres (A) together with the impregnated ones (I) constitute a higher percentage by weight and by volume than the cellulose acetate fibres with activated carbon (C). Consequently, the filters made of the plain and the impregnated cellulose acetate fibres (A, I) give the article its essential character within the meaning of GIR 3(b).\nThe filters made of the plain and the impregnated cellulose acetate fibres (A, I) do not have the required cohesion and strength. Consequently, classification under headings 5602  as ‘felt’ or 5603  as ‘nonwovens’ is excluded.\nThe filters made of the plain and the impregnated cellulose acetate fibres (A, I) are not made from a textile ‘fabric’ within the meaning of Note 1 to Chapter 63. Consequently, classification under heading 6307  is excluded.\nWithin the filters made of the plain and the impregnated cellulose acetate fibres (A, I), the fibres are oriented parallel to each other. Consequently, they are excluded from classification under heading 5601  as ‘articles of wadding’.\nSince filters made of the plain and the impregnated cellulose acetate fibres (A, I) cannot be classified under any heading in accordance to GIR 1 to 3, they are to be classified by application of GIR 4 in the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.\nSince the fibres are readily separable and ‘pluckable’, and form a flexible, spongy body of even thickness, their outward appearance is that of wadding. Consequently, the filters (A, I) are to be classified under heading 5601  (see also the HS Classification Opinion classifying ‘rods for making cigarette filter tips’ under subheading 5601\xa022 ).\nThe impregnation of the cellulose acetate fibres (I) does not exclude classification under heading 5601 , because the agglutinating substance does not penetrate into the inner layers of the fibres (see the HS explanatory notes to heading 5601 , (A), fourth paragraph).\nThe article is therefore to be classified under CN code 5601\xa022\xa010  as ‘articles of wadding of man-made fibres’.\n664\xa0A\n664\xa0B\n(\n*1\n)\nThe photographs are purely for information.'}]}"

conferring management of aid implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in Romania in the pre-accession period
(2006/298/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on co-ordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89 (1), and in particular Article 12(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period (2), and in particular Article 4(5) and (6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Special Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development for Romania (hereinafter Sapard) was approved by Commission Decision C(2000) 3742 final of 12 December 2000, as last amended by Commission Decision C(2006) 1194 of 11 April 2006, in accordance with Article 4(5) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999.
(2) The government of Romania and the Commission, acting on behalf of the European Community, signed on 2 February 2001 the Multi-Annual Financing Agreement laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of Sapard, as last amended by the Annual Financing Agreement for 2004, signed on 12 May 2005, which finally entered into force on 3 November 2005.
(3) The SAPARD Agency, public institution with legal status, in the subordination of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests and Rural Development has been appointed by the competent authority of Romania for the implementation of some of the measures defined in Sapard. The National Fund Department within the Ministry of Public Finance has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of Sapard.
(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted Decision 2002/638/EC of 31 July 2002 (3) and Decision 2003/846/EC of 5 December 2003 (4) conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in Romania in the pre-accession period with regard to certain measures provided for in Sapard.
(5) The Commission has undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of measure 1.2 ‘Improving the structures for quality, veterinary and plant-health controls, for the quality of foodstuffs and consumer protection’; measure 3.2 ‘Setting-up producers’ groups’; measure 3.3 ‘Agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and maintain the countryside’ and measure 3.5 ‘Forestry’ as provided for in Sapard. The Commission considers that, also with regard to those measures, Romania complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period (5), and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex-ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer with regard to measure 1.2, measure 3.2, measure 3.3 and measure 3.5, on the SAPARD Agency and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, in Romania the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(7) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission for measure 1.2, measure 3.2, measure 3.3 and measure 3.5 are based on a system that is not yet fully operating with regard to all relevant elements, it is therefore appropriate to confer the management of the SAPARD Programme on the SAPARD Agency and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.
(8) Full conferral of management of the Sapard is only envisaged after further verifications, in order to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily, have been carried out and after any recommendations the Commission may issue, with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the SAPARD Agency, in the subordination of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forests, Waters and Environment and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, have been implemented.
(9) On 6 October 2005 the Romanian Authorities proposed the rules for eligibility of expenditure for measure 1.2, measure 3.2 and measure 3.5, in accordance with Article 4(1) of Section B of the Multi-Annual Financing Agreement. The Commission is called upon to take a decision in this respect.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1998 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(2) provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) France still has intervention stocks of wheat.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of wheat held by the French intervention agency available on the internal market.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender.
(6) When the French intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular Article 15(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to the animal health requirements laid down in the specific acts of the Union referred to in Annex F thereto.
(2) Varroosis in bees is listed under its former name ‘varroasis’ in Annex B to Directive 92/65/EEC. It is caused by ectoparasitic mites of the genus Varroa and has been reported worldwide.
(3) Article 15 of Directive 92/65/EEC provides that, where a Member State considers that its territory or part of its territory is free from one of the diseases listed in Annex B thereto, it is to submit to the Commission appropriate documentation, on the basis of which a Decision is to be adopted.
(4) Varroosis spreads through movement of bee brood and direct contact between infested adult bees. The latter is only possible within the bee's flight range. Consequently, only territories where the movement of bee hives and brood can be controlled and which are geographically isolated enough to prevent the migration of bees from the outside can be recognised as disease-free. Moreover, the competent authorities must prove through the results of extended surveillance that the region is indeed free from varroosis and that, to maintain the status, the introduction of live bees and brood is strictly controlled.
(5) By adopting Commission Implementing Decision 2013/503/EU (2), the Åland Islands in Finland were recognised as a territory that is free from varroosis.
(6) The United Kingdom asked the Commission to recognise the territory of the Isle of Man as free from varroosis.
(7) Although the Isle of Man, as an internally self-governing dependency of the British Crown, is not part of the Union, it has a specific limited relationship with the Union. As a result, Regulation (EEC) No 706/73 of the Council (3) provides that for the purpose of applying rules concerning, amongst others, animal health legislation, the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man are to be treated as a single Member State.
(8) Varroosis is a notifiable disease on the Isle of Man and no bees in any stage of their life cycle, used hives, skeps or any receptacle used to house bees can be moved from mainland United Kingdom to the Isle of Man. In addition it is an island situated in the Irish Sea far outside the flight range of bees and it is therefore geographically sufficiently separated from potentially varroosis-infected areas.
(9) In accordance with Article 15(1) of Directive 92/65/EEC, the United Kingdom has submitted to the Commission documentation detailing the surveillance measures applied over several years to the bee population on the Isle of Man and the arrangements for verifying the absence of varroosis in that population.
(10) Following evaluation of the documentation submitted by the United Kingdom, the Isle of Man can be considered as a territory of the United Kingdom free from varroosis.
(11) The additional guarantees required in trade should therefore be defined, taking into account the measures already provided for in the legislation of the Isle of Man.
(12) The Annex to Implementing Decision 2013/503/EU should be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '19.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 45/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/266\nof 16 February 2015\nrecognising the Isle of Man as free of varroosis and amending the Annex to Implementing Decision 2013/503/EU\n(notified under document C(2015) 715)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Union of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to the animal health requirements laid down in the specific acts of the Union referred to in Annex F thereto.\n\n((2)) Varroosis in bees is listed under its former name ‘varroasis’ in Annex B to Directive 92/65/EEC.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 23 December 1988  terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain cellular mobile radio telephones originating in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan  (88/651/EEC)  (88/651/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by that Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE  (1) In June 1987 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the sole producer of complete TACS mobile telephones in the Community. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the product concerned originating in Japan and Canada and of material  injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to warrant the opening of an investigation.
The Commission accordingly announced, by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain cellular mobile radio telephones falling  within CN code ex 8525 20 90 originating in Japan and Canada, and commenced an investigation.
(2) In December 1987 the Commission received a complementary complaint from the same Community producer requesting an extension of the proceeding to include imports of the product concerned originating in Hong Kong. The complementary complaint contained  evidence that the transceivers for cellular mobile radio telephones sold in the Community were produced in Hong Kong.
The Commission accordingly announced, in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the extension of the anti-dumping proceeding to include imports of certain cellular mobile telephones originating in Hong Kong.
(3) The Commission officially notified the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainant and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and  to request a hearing.
(4) Most of the producers/exporters and importers known to be concerned made known their views in writing. Some of them requested and were granted hearings.
(5) The Commission sought and verified all the information it considered necessary for a determination of injury. On-the-spot investigations were carried out at the premises of the following companies:
(a) Community producer:
Motorola Limited UK, Basingstoke and Stotfold  (b) Importers/distributors:
Mitsubishi Electric UK Ltd, Rickmansworth  Panasonic Industrial UK Ltd, Slough  NEC Business Systems (Europe) Ltd, London  Novatel Communications Limited, Melksham  Carphone Group, Frome  Racal Vodac Ltd, Newbury  (6) The investigation period set pursuant to Article 7 (1) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 covered the period 1 January to 30 June 1987.
B. INJURY  (7) In order to determine whether or not the allegedly dumped imports caused material injury to the Community industry, the Commission took into consideration the following facts:
(a) Volume, market share and price of imports  (i) Volume  (8) Imports into the Community of cellular mobile radio telephones originating in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan increased from 37 376 units in 1985 to 46 069 in 1986. During the first half of 1987, 36 337 units were imported. Extrapolated over the whole  of 1987 the latter development would have represented a substantial increase. However, this trend should be assessed in the light of the development of the consumption of the product concerned during this period.
(ii) Consumption and market shares  (9) It was found that the consumption of the product concerned, the sales of which - for technical reasons - are limited to the United Kingdom and Irish markets, increased from approximately 112 000 units at the end of 1986 to approximately 175 000  units in June 1987, i.e. an increase of 56 %.
As far as the market share is concerned, it was found that during the same period the share held by the exporters concerned in this proceeding increased by 0,5 %.
(iii) Prices  (10) The evidence available to the Commission shows that during the reference period the prices of the imports were not lower than those charged by the Community producer.
(b) Effect on Community industry  (11) The Commission also examined whether the increase in allegedly dumped imports had a significant effect on the Community industry:
(i) Community production  (12) With regard to the production of the Community producer concerned, it was found that there was a sharp increase between 1985 (when Community production started) and 1986, and again during the first half of 1987.
(ii) Sales  (13) It was also found that sales of the product manufactured in the Community increased significantly between 1985 and 1986 and further increased during the first six months of 1987.
(iii) Consumption and market share  (14) The development of the production and sales of the Community producer concerned must be assessed in the light of the development of the consumption and market share of the Community industry as described above. The market share held by the  Community producer increased by 4 %. From a comparison of this increase in market shares of the Community industry and that of the allegedly dumped imports, it results that, in the period between December 1986 and June 1987, the share held by the  Community industry increased more than that held by the imports concerned in this investigation.
(iv) Capacity and capacity utilization  (15) With regard to the production capacity and capacity utilization of the Community producers it was found that, whereas the former increased by 52 % between 1986 and the investigation period, the latter more than doubled during the same period.
(v) Prices  (16) As far as the sales prices of the Community producer are concerned, it was found that they declined significantly during the major part of 1986 but more or less stabilized towards the end of 1986 and continued doing so during the first half of  1987.
(vi) Profits  (17) With regard to profitability it was found that after substantial losses in 1986, the Community producer's situation improved significantly during the investigation period. Although sales through a major sales channel continued to be made at a loss,  a considerable overall profit was realised on sales of cellular mobile radio telephones.
(c) Conclusion  (18) The above data indicates that, despite the significant growth in imports into the Community, the European producer was able to increase both production and market share as well as, given the abovementioned price stabilization, improve the company's  financial results.
(19) In the light of these findings it is considered that the Community producer concerned did not suffer material injury during the investigation period.
C. DUMPING  (20) In view of the above findings with respect to injury the Commission considered it unnecessary - notwithstanding the importance of the dumping margins alleged - to further investigate the question of dumping with regard to the imports concerned.
D. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING  (21) After having been informed by the Commission of the above findings, the complainant decided to withdraw the complaint due to the change in circumstances since the end of 1986.
In these circumstances, protective measures are unnecessary and the proceeding should be terminated,","{'title': '88/651/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 December 1988 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain cellular mobile radio telephones originating in Canada, Hong Kong and Japan'}"

Having regard to Council Directive 87/54/EEC of 16 December 1986 on the legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products (1) and in particular Article 3 (7) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the right to legal protection of topographies of semiconductor products in the Community applies to persons qualifying for protection under Article 3 (1) to (5) of Directive 87/54/EEC;
Whereas this right can be extended by Council Decision to persons who do not benefit from protection under the said provisions;
Whereas the extension of the protection in question should, as far as possible, be decided by the Community as a whole;
Whereas the Community has, since 7 November 1987, extended such protection on the basis of a series of interim Council Decisions to persons from certain territories the number of which was increased on 1 November 1993 (2);
Whereas these Decisions were based on the consideration that the territories which did not yet have specific legislation would make such provision and would make it applicable as soon as possible to persons from the Member States of the Community  benefiting from the right to protection under Directive 87/54/EEC;
Whereas the last of these Decisions, Decision 93/16/EEC, applies until 31 December 1994;
Whereas the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, which forms part of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations embodied in the Marrakesh Final Act of 15 April 1994, requires Members to grant  protection to integrated-circuit topographies in compliance with its own provisions and with those of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits to which it refers;
Whereas the Agreement, together with that establishing the World Trade Organization (to which it is annexed), will enter into force on 1 January 1995 or as soon as possible after that date; whereas the developed countries which are Members of the  Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization will have one year following the entry into force of that Agreement in which to implement the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights; whereas developing-country Members will  be entitled to defer for a further period of four years the date of application of the provisions of that Agreement other than Articles 3, 4 and 5;
Whereas it is foreseeable that the Agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights will be applied in the territories concerned within the prescribed deadlines;
Whereas provisions guaranteeing protection in the territories concerned for persons from the Community as regards topographies are in force in those territories;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, under Article 27 (1) of the Sixth Directive, the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas the United Kingdom was authorized by a Council Decision deemed to have been adopted on 14 April 1987, in accordance with the procedure laid down by Article 27 (4) of the Sixth Directive, to introduce, for a period of two years from 1 April 1987, a derogation measure to combat tax avoidance;
Whereas the purpose of that measure is to prevent groups of businesses which are treated as a single taxable person within the meaning of Article 4 (4) of the Sixth Directive and are not entitled to deduct tax in full from being able to enjoy full deduction of the tax on certain transfers of assets;
Whereas to prevent tax avoidance of this type the United Kingdom applies a legislative provision laying down that the company to which such assets are transferred becomes liable to tax;
Whereas the said measure constitutes a derogation from Article 21 (1) (a) of the Sixth Directive, whereby, under the internal system, the person liable for the tax is the taxable person who carries out the taxable transaction;
Whereas the United Kingdom has, by a letter registered at the Commission on 9 January 1989, requested authorization to extend the said measure by one year pending adoption of other provisions to be based on Article 20 of the Sixth Directive;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 9 February 1989 of the request made by the United Kingdom; whereas the Council's Decision is deemed to have been adopted if, within two months of the other Member States being informed, neither the Commission nor any Member State being informed, neither the Commission nor any Member State has requested that the matter be raised by the Council; whereas no such request has been made; whereas the Council's Decision is thus deemed to have been adopted on 11 April 1989;

Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry. Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.
(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.
(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(5) The United Kingdom notified the Commission of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5 in a holding on its territory where poultry or other captive birds are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones.
(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with the United Kingdom, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holding where the outbreak was confirmed.
(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly define the protection and surveillance zones established in the United Kingdom at Union level in collaboration with that Member State.
(8) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed, the protection and surveillance zones in the United Kingdom, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in the Annex to this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1233/2006 of 16 August 2006 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota of pigmeat allocated to the United States of America (4) has to be amended substantially. Regulation (EC) No 1233/2006 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new regulation.
(3) Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (5) and 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (6) should apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.
(4) In order to maintain a regular flow of imports, the quota period from 1 July to 30 June of the following year should be subdivided into a number of subperiods. In any event, under Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 licences are valid only up to and including the last day of the tariff quota period.
(5) The tariff quota should be administered on the basis of import licences. For this purpose, it is important to specify the arrangements for submitting applications and the details that should appear on the licence applications and the licences themselves.
(6) In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in question in the pigmeat sector, precise conditions should be laid down as regards operators' access to the tariff quota scheme.
(7) For appropriate administration of the tariff quotas, the security linked to the import licences should be set at EUR 20 per 100 kilograms.
(8) In the interest of the operators, the Commission should establish the quantities that have not been applied for, which are to be carried over to the following subperiod in accordance with Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for other woven fabrics of cotton falling within heading No 55.09 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Spain (1985)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas an Agreement between the European Economic Community and Spain (1) was concluded on 29 June 1970 and supplemented by the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Spain consequent on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community (2);
Whereas the Community committed itself, under this Agreement, to opening an annual total Community tariff quota of 2 013 tonnes of other woven fabrics of cotton, falling within heading No 55.09 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Spain; whereas, the quota duty is equal to 40 % of the Common Customs Tariff duty in respect of the products concerned; whereas this Community tariff quota should be opened for 1985;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the principles mentioned above, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market of the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States calculated by reference to the statistics of imports from Spain over a representative period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports by each of the Member States represent the following percentages of the imports into the Community from Spain of the products concerned:
1.2.3.4 //   //   //   //   // Member State  // 1981  // 1982  // 1983  //   //   //   //   // Benelux  // 4,8  // 1,7  // 0,7  // Denmark  // 0,3  // 0,2  // 0,1  // Germany  // 3,6  // 5,1  // 4,1  // Greece  // -  // 0,3  // 1,1  // France  // 74,2  // 60,1  // 58,2  // Ireland  // 12,0  // 21,2  // 27,8  // Italy  // 3,9  // 8,0  // 4,2  // United Kingdom  // 1,2  // 3,4  // 3,8  //   //   //   //
Whereas, in view of these factors, and of market forecasts for the products in question and in particular of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:
Benelux 2,1
Denmark 0,3
Germany 4,4
Greece 0,6
France 63,6
Ireland 22,1
Italy 3,8
United Kingdom 3,1
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of those Member States having used up their initial quota shares; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should under present circumstances be fixed at 85 % of the quota;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic anti-dumping Regulation) and in particular Articles 11(4) and 13(4) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) The Council, by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 (3) and (EC) No 2597/1999 (4) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing measures respectively on PET film originating, inter alia, in India (the original measures). By Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 (5) and (EC) No 1976/2004 (6), the Council extended these measures to PET film consigned from Israel and from Brazil (the extended measures) with the exception of imports produced by one Brazilian company, Terphane Ltd, and one Israeli company, Jolybar Ltd, specifically mentioned in each of those Regulations.
(2) By Regulation (EC) No 101/2006 (7) the Council amended Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 in order to exempt one other Israeli company, Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Ltd, from the extended measures.
(3) Following an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 (8), imposed an anti-dumping duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and maintained the extension of that duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether or not declared as originating in Brazil or Israel, with the exception of certain producers specified in Articles 2(4) of that Regulation (the anti-dumping measures in force).
(4) Following an expiry review of the countervailing measures, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (9) imposed a countervailing duty on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India and maintained the extension of that duty to imports of the same product consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether or not declared as originating in Brazil or Israel, with the exception of certain producers specified in Article 1(3) of that Regulation (the countervailing measures in force). The anti-dumping measures in force and the countervailing measures in force shall hereinafter together be referred to as ‘the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force’.
(5) Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 were last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 15/2009 (10).
B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION
1.   Request for a review
(6) The Commission subsequently received a request for an exemption from the extended measures pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20, 23(5) and 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. The application was lodged by S.Z.P. Plastic Packaging Products Ltd (SZP), a producer in Israel (the country concerned).
2.   Initiation of a review
(7) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by SZP and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20, 23(5) and 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting SZP an exemption from the extended measures. After consultation of the Advisory Committee, and after the Union industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Regulation (EU) No 6/2010 (11) (the initiating Regulation), a review of Regulations (EC) No 1292/2007 and (EC) No 367/2006 with regard to SZP.
(8) The Regulation initiating the review repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 with regard to imports of the product under investigation consigned from Israel by SZP. Simultaneously, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, customs authorities were directed to take appropriate steps to register such imports.
3.   Product concerned
(9) The product concerned is the same as that defined in the regulations imposing the original measures, being polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India, currently falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product concerned).
(10) It is considered that the PET film consigned from Israel to the Union under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product under review) has the same basic technical, physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses as the product concerned. Therefore, it is considered to be a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 2(c) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.
4.   Investigation
(11) The Commission officially advised SZP and the representatives of the country concerned of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were invited to make their views known and informed of the possibility to request a hearing. No such request was, however, received.
(12) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to SZP and received a reply within the relevant deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purposes of the review. A verification visit was carried out at the premises of SZP.
5.   Investigation period
(13) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009 (the IP). Data was collected from 2006 up to the end of the IP to investigate any change in the pattern of trade.
C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(14) The investigation confirmed that SZP did not export the product under review to the European Union during the period of the investigation that led to the extended measures, i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003. SZP’s first exports of the product under review occurred subsequent to the extension of measures to, inter alia, Israel.
(15) Furthermore, according to documentary evidence submitted, SZP was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it did not have any direct or indirect links with any of the Indian exporting producers or Israeli companies subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force.
(16) As already mentioned in recital 14, SZP did not export the product concerned to the Union until after the period of investigation that led to the extended measures. SZP manufactures PET film and either sells this film or uses it itself to produce a range of packaging products.
(17) Raw material of Indian origin, amongst others, is used by SZP to manufacture PET film exported to the Union but this was not considered to be a process involving circumvention. The Indian raw material constituted only a small proportion of the raw material bought at arms-length by SZP and was mixed with other raw materials which were mainly purchased domestically. The Indian producer of the raw material is a long-standing supplier to SZP.
(18) In addition no evidence was found that SZP was purchasing finished PET film from India to resell or tranship to the European Union.
D.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED
(19) In accordance with the above findings that SZP has not engaged in circumvention practices, the company should be exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force.
(20) The registration of imports of PET film consigned from Israel by SZP, as imposed by the initiating Regulation, should cease. In accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, which provides that measures shall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration, and in view of the exemption of the company from measures, no anti-dumping duty should be collected on imports of PET film consigned from Israel by SZP which entered the Union under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation.
(21) In relation to the countervailing measures, as SZP has been found not to be circumventing the measures in force, the exemption should take effect from the date of entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 6/2010 in accordance with Article 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. Repayment or remission must be requested from national customs authorities in accordance with applicable customs legislation.
(22) The exemption from the extended measures granted to PET film produced by SZP shall, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 23(6) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, remain valid on condition that the facts as finally ascertained justify the exemption and that it is, for instance, not established that the exemption was granted on the basis of false or misleading information submitted by the company concerned. Should prima facie evidence indicate otherwise, an investigation may be initiated by the Commission to establish if withdrawal of the exemption is warranted.
(23) The exemption from the extended measures of imports of PET film from SZP was established on the basis of the findings of the present review. This exemption is thus exclusively applicable to imports of PET film consigned from Israel and produced by that specific legal entity. Imported PET film produced or consigned by any company not specifically mentioned in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 and Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from the exemption and should be subject to the residual duty rate as imposed by those Regulations.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1742/96 (2) and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas, scientific data to address outstanding questions on safety and residues have been provided, these were considered insufficient to conclude the assessment on albendazole, thiamphenicol, oxibendazole, flubendazole and azaperone, so that they can be inserted into Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 2377/90;
Whereas additional information has now been provided in respect of albendazole, thiamphenicol, oxibendazole, flubendazole and azaperone; the duration of validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 2377/90 for the above-mentioned substances shall be extended in order that completion of the scientific evaluation in progress may be achieved;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

(3) To ensure uninterrupted supplies to the enlarged Community market while taking account of the economic supply conditions in the new Member States prior to their accession to the European Union, an autonomous and temporary import tariff quota should be opened for preserved mushrooms of the genus Agaricus falling within CN codes 0711 51 00, 2003 10 20 and 2003 10 30.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 955/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 249 thereof,

Whereas:
(1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 of 21 December 1998 applying a multiannual scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period 1 July 1999 to 31 December 2001(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1310/2000(6), the Community gave such preferences to Nepal.
(2) Articles 67 to 97 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 establish the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purposes of generalised tariff preferences. Article 76 of that Regulation provides, however, for derogations to those provisions in favour of least-developed GSP-beneficiary countries which submit an appropriate request to that effect to the Community.
(3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1539/1999(7), Nepal obtained such a derogation for certain textiles, for the period from 15 July 1999 to 14 July 2000.
(4) The request submitted by Nepal satisfies the requirements of Article 76 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. In particular the introduction of quantitative conditions (on an annual basis) reflecting the Community market's capacity to absorb the Nepalese products, Nepal's export-capacity and actual recorded trade flows, is such as to prevent injury to the corresponding branches of Community industry. The derogation should be adapted, however, with reference to the economic needs.
(5) In order to encourage regional cooperation among beneficiary countries, it is desirable to provide that the raw materials to be used in Nepal in the context of this derogation should originate in countries belonging to the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) (except Myanmar), to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) or to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
(6) The open and effective administration of these measures should be ensured by applying the relevant provisions, for the management of tariff quotas, laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1427/97(8).
(7) Any demand to extend application of the derogation beyond the quantities provided for must be considered in consultation with the Nepalese authorities.
(8) To be fully effective, the derogation should be granted for a reasonable length of time, that is, until 31 December 2001 when Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 expires.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade.

Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 29 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Lombardia; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under  this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the Italian authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a  single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole  programmation period;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (1), and in particular Articles 5 (9) and 28 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3901/89 of 12 December 1989 defining lambs fattened as heavy carcases (2), and in particular Article 1 (2) thereof,
Whereas Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 states that a producer marketing sheep's milk or sheep's milk products will, if he can prove that at least 40 % of the lambs born on his holding have been fattened as heavy carcases with a view to their slaughter, be able, at his request, to receive the premium for the heavy category, in proportion to the number of lambs born on his holding which are fattened as heavy carcases;
Whereas Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3901/89 defines lambs fattened as heavy carcases as those which have been the subject, after weaning, of a declaration of stock sent for fattening in verifiable batches and have reached a minimum average weight of 25 kilograms following a minimum period of fattening of 45 days; whereas, however, the second subparagraph of that paragraph provides for a derogation with regard to weaning for lambs belonging to a limited number of meat breeds and raised in geographically well defined areas;
Whereas the obligations to be complied with by the producer in order to be able to benefit from the provisions of Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 should be defined; whereas it is necessary to provide for an effective control procedure to ensure compliance with the provisions in question; whereas in cases where lambs are fattened in a Member State other than that in which the producer lodged his premium application and fattening declaration a procedure for administrative cooperation between the competent authorities of the two Member States must be set up and such procedures are to be notified to the Commission;
Whereas, for application of the derogation with regard to weaning, specific obligations should be laid down in order to make effective control possible; whereas for that purpose the beneficiary should be required to fatten as heavy carcases all the lambs born to his ewes; whereas this obligation is in line with customary farming practice in the geographical areas and for the breeds for which this derogation is intended;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 22 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the arrangements which are the subject of this Regulation may apply in Spain or Portugal from the 1990 marketing year if those Member States have introduced, from the 1990 marketing year, the measures provided for in Article 4 (4) of that Regulation; whereas, by Commission Decision 90/19/EEC (3), Spain was authorized, on a transitional basis and from the beginning of that marketing year, to introduce the arrangements on the basis of national implementing provisions; whereas Portugal has stated its intention to introduce the arrangements during the 1990 marketing year; whereas there should therefore be provision for this Regulation to apply only to premiums to be paid for the 1990 marketing year for which application has not yet been made;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sheep and Goats,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2814/90 of 28 September 1990 laying down detailed rules for the definition of lambs fattened as heavy carcasses', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Following submission of the application he shall also submit to the competent authority, no later than the day fattening of a batch begins, a specific declaration stating at least:\n\n- the date fattening is to begin,\n\n- the number of lambs in the batch,\n\n- the location where fattening is to take place.\n\nThese specific declarations shall relate to lambs whose fattening begins between 15 November preceding the beginning of the marketing year for which they are submitted and the following 14 November.\n\nFurthermore, if fattening takes place away from the beneficiary's holding, the declaration referred to in the previous subparagraph shall be accompanied by an undertaking by the manager of the fattening house to permit the controls for which provision is made in order to ensure that the fattening operations are being carried out.\n\n2. Holders of lambs that are fattened shall keep an up-to-date fattening register including the following information:\n\n(a) for each batch brought in for fattening:\n\n- the number of the batch, the number of lambs and the date fattening began,\n\n- a note of the indelible identification mark of the lambs and of the holding of origin;\n\n(b) for each batch leaving after fattening:\n\n- the date and average weight of the batch,\n\n- the composition of the batch showing the number of lambs from each batch brought in making up the batch leaving.\n\n3. The competent authorities designated by the Member States shall institute measures to check the declarations referred to in paragraph 1. These measures shall include:\n\n- on-the-spot inspections at the place of fattening of at least 10 % of those submitting declarations in respect of any marketing year,\n\n- an obligation on a person holding batches in a fattening house to provide the information needed for such checks.\n\n4.

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3815/89 (2) lays down detailed rules for the application of the compensation mechanism to imports of fruit and vegetables from Spain;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 152 of the Act of Accession, a compensation mechanism is to be introduced on imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, hereinafter referred to as the 'Community of Ten', from 1 January 1990, of fruit and vegetables from Spain for which a reference price is fixed with regard to third countries; whereas, Community offer prices for tomatoes coming from Spain should be fixed only during the period where reference prices are fixed with regard to third countries, this means from 1 April up to and including 20 December;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 152 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each Member State of the Community of Ten, plus transport and packaging costs incurred by the products from the production regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and bearing in mind developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetable sector; whereas the abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied for third countries;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3709/89, the producer prices to be used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product defined by its commercial characteristics recorded on the representative market or markets located in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter and which meet quality class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared with the normal fluctionations recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive variations with respect of normal price fluctuations, it shall not be taken into account;
Whereas, up to 10 July, tomatoes produced in the Community of Ten are grown mainly under glass; whereas the Community offer prices for this period of the marketing year must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas tomatoes imported from Spain during the same period will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such tomatoes may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for tomatoes not grown under glass should thereofre be adjusted by a conversion factor;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices being fixed for tomatoes for the period 1 April to 20 December 1990 at the levels set out hereinafter;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter of 23 March 2011 the United Kingdom requested authorisation to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on gas oil and unleaded petrol pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC on the islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the islands in the Clyde (all off the coast of Scotland) and the Isles of Scilly (off the south west coast of England).
(2) In these islands, the prices of gas oil and unleaded petrol are higher than the average prices in the rest of the territory of the United Kingdom, placing local fuel consumers at a disadvantage. The price difference is due to additional per unit costs induced by the geographic location of the islands, their low population numbers and the delivery of relatively low volumes of fuel.
(3) The tax reduction will be no larger than what is necessary to compensate for the additional per unit costs borne by the consumers in the geographical areas concerned.
(4) The reduced rates of taxation will be above the minimum rates laid down in Article 7 of Directive 2003/96/EC.
(5) In view of the insular nature of the areas to which it applies and the moderate reduction in the rate, the measure will not give rise to any movement specifically linked to the supply of fuel.
(6) Consequently, the measure is acceptable from the point of view of the proper functioning of the internal market and of the need to ensure fair competition and it is compatible with the Union’s health, environment, energy and transport policies.
(7) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that Article must be strictly limited in time. In order to provide the businesses and consumers concerned with a sufficient degree of certainty, the authorisation should be granted for a period of six years. However, in order not to undermine future general developments in the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to provide that, should the Council, acting on the basis of Article 113 of the Treaty, introduce a modified general system for the taxation of energy products to which the authorisation granted in this Decision would not be adapted, this Decision should expire on the day on which the rules on that modified system become applicable,","{'header': '30.11.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 317/34', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 24 November 2011\nauthorising the United Kingdom to apply reduced levels of taxation to motor fuels supplied on the islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly, in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\n(2011/776/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter of 23 March 2011 the United Kingdom requested authorisation to apply a reduced rate of excise duty on gas oil and unleaded petrol pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC on the islands of the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the islands in the Clyde (all off the coast of Scotland) and the Isles of Scilly (off the south west coast of England).\n\n((2)) In these islands, the prices of gas oil and unleaded petrol are higher than the average prices in the rest of the territory of the United Kingdom, placing local fuel consumers at a disadvantage.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 724/75 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Fund Regulation"") provides, independently of the national allocation of resources laid down by Article 2 (3) (a) of that Regulation, for participation by the Fund in financing specific Community regional development measures which are linked with Community policies and with measures adopted by the Community, in order to take better account of their regional dimension or to reduce their regional consequences;
Whereas the Member State concerned has provided the Commission with information on regional problems which might be the subject of a specific Community measure;
Whereas the Fund's resources are allocated with due regard to the relative severity of regional imbalance within the Community;
Whereas the negotiations on the accession of Portugal and Spain to the Community were opened on 17 October 1978 and 15 February 1979, respectively;
Whereas the southern regions of the Community could be affected by its enlargement, particularly because of increased competition in markets for certain agricultural products and because of problems involved in adapting their economic fabric;
Whereas, among these regions, the Mezzogiorno and the three regions of France adjacent to Spain are already benefiting, in this context, from a specific Community regional development measure instituted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2615/80 of 7 October 1980 instituting a specific Community regional development measure contributing to the development of certain French and Italian regions in the context of Community enlargement (6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 214/84 (7);
Whereas, in addition, Greece has been a member of the Community since 1 January 1981 ; whereas the development of some of that country's regions could also be adversely affected by the future enlargement of the Community to include Portugal and Spain;
Whereas this is particularly the case with the Greek islands, which are characterized by a very high dependence for employment on agriculture, which is itself heavily dependent on Mediterranean products, by a very weak economic structure and, furthermore, by their remoteness from the centres of economic activity owing to their particular geographical position;
Whereas it is in the Community's interest that the enlargement process should take place harmoniously ; whereas it is therefore necessary, even before the accessions become effective, to undertake vigorous structural measures in order that these regions may be able to adapt to enlargement ; whereas it is appropriate that the Community should make a special contribution to measures to be undertaken to this end by the Member State concerned by (1) OJ No L 73, 21.3.1975, p. 1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below.
(3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81, the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81.
(4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances, to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations.
(5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination.
(6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(4).
(7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6), Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

(2) Cyprus has faced the second most severe and longest drought since 1900, due to rainfall deficit in 2007 and 2008, August 2008 having proven the hottest month of the last decade and precipitation from January to August 2008 having been only 50 % of normal levels.
(3) According to preliminary data concerning the 2008 harvest, 95 % of cereal-producing areas have not yielded any crop at all, whereas fodder production has fallen so drastically that it has failed to cover even the minimum feed requirements of ruminant animals.
(4) From a quantity of about 150 million m3 or 54,7 % of capacity at the end of 2005, Cyprus' network of dams currently holds only 11 million m3 or 4 % of total capacity, obliging the authorities to strictly ration the water supply for irrigation purposes at the beginning of 2007 and to cut it down to zero in 2008.
(5) These damages must be considered all the more serious and exceptional, given that Cyprus put in place effective tools for risk and crisis management. In particular, Cyprus applies improved irrigation techniques in almost 95 % of the area under irrigation and has introduced water pricing policies and punitive measures to discourage excessive water consumption and losses, as well as promoted and provided incentives for the installation of water recycling systems in houses. Furthermore, Cyprus' National Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 already includes a number of measures to improve the use of water.
(6) Since the income of Cypriot farmers affected by the drought has been drastically reduced, they face the serious risk of not having the financial means to meet the immediate needs of their families and to start a new season, leading to an imminent danger of land abandonment, soil erosion and desertification.
(7) The State aid to be granted amounts to EUR 67,5 million and will benefit 34 000 eligible farmers and 3 000 livestock keepers.
(8) In order to be effective, the State aid must be granted and accessed by farmers as soon as possible.
(9) The Commission has not at this stage given an opinion on the nature and compatibility of the aid.
(10) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the emergency situation which has risen, to be compatible with the common market,","{'header': '13.11.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 302/7', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 20 October 2008\non the granting of an emergency State aid by the authorities of Cyprus to mitigate the consequences of drought in 2007/2008 in the agricultural sector\n(2008/853/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 19 September 2008, Cyprus presented to the Council a request for a decision in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) of the Treaty, declaring that the plan of Cyprus to grant national aid to Cypriot farmers hit by extreme drought in order to allow them to begin the next season's production cycle is compatible with the common market.\n\n((2)) Cyprus has faced the second most severe and longest drought since 1900, due to rainfall deficit in 2007 and 2008, August 2008 having proven the hottest month of the last decade and precipitation from January to August 2008 having been only 50\xa0% of normal levels.\n\n((3)) According to preliminary data concerning the 2008 harvest, 95\xa0% of cereal-producing areas have not yielded any crop at all, whereas fodder production has fallen so drastically that it has failed to cover even the minimum feed requirements of ruminant animals.\n\n((4)) From a quantity of about 150 million m3or 54,7\xa0% of capacity at the end of 2005, Cyprus' network of dams currently holds only 11 million m3or 4\xa0% of total capacity, obliging the authorities to strictly ration the water supply for irrigation purposes at the beginning of 2007 and to cut it down to zero in 2008.\n\n((5)) These damages must be considered all the more serious and exceptional, given that Cyprus put in place effective tools for risk and crisis management.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (1), and in particular Article 27 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas, by letter to the Commission registered on 10 September 1996, the Kingdom of Belgium requested authorization to introduce a measure derogating from Article 9 of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 20 December 1996 of the request made by the Kingdom of Belgium;
Whereas the measure is necessary to counter the tax avoidance effects that have led a growing number of Community taxable and non-taxable persons to purchase telecommunications services outside the Community in order to avoid payment of VAT; whereas the measure is furthermore necessary to discourage suppliers of telecommunications services established in a Member State from establishing themselves outside the Community;
Whereas the measure is also necessary to simplify the procedure for charging the tax insofar as it provides the same tax obligations for customers of telecommunications services regardless of whether these services are performed by suppliers established inside or outside the Community;
Whereas the derogations will not affect, except to a negligible extent, the amount of tax due at the final consumption stage and will not therefore have an adverse effect on the European Communities' own resources arising from value-added tax;
Whereas it is necessary to grant this measure from 1 January 1997 in order to remedy as quickly as possible a situation undermining the competitiveness of European telecommunications companies; whereas from 1 January 1997 the customers and the suppliers of telecommunications services had no longer a legitimate confidence in the continuation of the legislation in force at that date;
Whereas it is desirable that the derogation should be granted until 31 December 1999, or, if a Directive altering the place of taxation of telecommunications services enters into force at an earlier date, until that date, in order to allow the Council to adopt a general Community solution based on the Commission proposal,","{'title': '97/200/EC: Council Decision of 17 March 1997 authorizing the Kingdom of Belgium to apply a measure derogating from Article 9 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 9 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Kingdom of Belgium is authorized to include, within Article 9 (2) (e) of the Directive, telecommunications services.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 30 March 1992 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 (2), a definitive anti-dumping duty was imposed on imports of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) originating in Taiwan, Indonesia, India, the People's Republic of China and Turkey.
(2) On 8 February 1994 by Commission Decisions 94/132/EC, 94/133/EC, 94/134/EC, 94/135/EC and 94/136/EC (3), full refunds were granted to five Community importers (Codev Textiles Ltd, Ottoman Pacific Ltd, Pax Yarns Ltd, Rowson & Son Ltd, Unicom BVBA/Unitrac) for their import of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) exported to the Community by the Indonesian producer PT Indorama Synthetics in the periods 3 October 1991 to 30 April 1992 and 1 May 1992 to 30 November 1992, after it was found that there was only negligible dumping on imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Indonesia and produced by PT Indorama Synthetics in the periods under consideration.
(3) Between June 1993 and October 1995, Aliatex SL (Spain), Aquatex SRL (Italy), Burnet, Walker & Co (UK), James North Textiles Ltd (UK), Pax Yarns Ltd (UK), Retorderie François Schoeters NV (Belgium), Rowson & Son Ltd (UK), Sethos GmbH (Germany), Soparil SA (France), Symaco NV (Belgium), Texelle SpA (Italy) and Unicom BVBA (Belgium) lodged recurring applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties paid on their imports of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) originating in Indonesia and produced by PT Indorama Synthetics. All of these applications concerned imports made between January 1993 and May 1995. The amounts of anti-dumping duty paid by each of these importers were as follows:
>TABLE>
(4) On 22 May 1995 the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1168/95 (4), amended Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 to repeal the anti-dumping duties imposed by the latter in respect of imports of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) originating in Indonesia and produced by certain specified Indonesian producers. This amendment took place after a partial review investigation for the period between 1 January 1993 and 31 December 1993 had shown that the exporters concerned had not practised any dumping or only negligible dumping. Among the Indonesian exporters having only negligible dumping was PT Indorama Synthetics.
(5) The refund applications being recurring, the Commission took the period from January 1993 to May 1995 as the reference period for its determination of whether the dumping margin of PT Indorama Synthetics had been eliminated or reduced to a level below the level of the duty in force. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for this purpose. The information obtained in the partial review was taken into account in this respect, in accordance with Article 11 (8) (c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 (5).
B. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANTS
(6) The applicants based their claims on the Decisions 94/132/EC, 94/133/EC, 94/134/EC, 94/135/EC, 94/136/EC, and on Regulation (EC) No 1168/95, all of which concluded that only negligible dumping occurred on imports of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) originating in Indonesia and produced by PT Indorama Synthetics. Information in respect of normal value and export prices for the period January 1994 to July 1995 was also submitted. This information showed a continuation of only negligible dumping.
C. ADMISSIBILITY
(7) One of the applications of Pax Yarns Ltd was lodged on 1 July 1994 and pertained to imports for which the amount of anti-dumping duty had been determined on 11 October 1993. Article 11 (8) (a) of Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 limits to six months the period for lodging a refund application. As the time elapsed between the date of due determination of the duty and the lodging of the application in this case is over eight months, this particular application is not admissible.
(8) Soparil SA lodged a refund application on 8 April 1994. This application relates to seven separate imports made at different moments in time. The application is admissible for the imports for which the amount of anti-dumping duty had been determined on 29 October and 1 December 1993. However, for the other five imports, the amount of anti-dumping duty was determined more than six months before the date on which the application was lodged. The application is therefore not admissible in respect of these other five imports.
(9) All other applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community anti-dumping legislation, in particular those concerning time limits and evidence to be provided.
D. MERITS OF THE CLAIMS
(10) The investigation carried out by the Commission for the year 1993 in the framework of the partial review leading to Regulation (EC) No 1168/95 showed that the dumping margin of PT Indorama Synthetics was negligible during that period. A similar negligible dumping margin had already been found for PT Indorama Synthetics in the previous refund decisions concerning this company. As for the period in between the end of the investigation period of the review, 31 December 1993, and the repealing of the anti-dumping duty in respect of the exporters concerned by the review, 25 May 1995, the available information indicates that the dumping margin of PT Indorama Synthetics continued to be negligible.
(11) In the absence of dumping by PT Indorama Synthetics, the amounts to be refunded correspond to the full amount of anti-dumping duty paid for those imports since 1 January 1993 and for which refund applications had been submitted within the legal time limits. Consequently, the amounts of the refunds to be made are:

The ACP-EC Partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. These are essential elements of the above Agreement and thus form the basis for relations between us.\nIn this respect, the European Union has followed closely the recent transition in Haiti, especially as regards the designation of the new Interim Government of Haiti, which was sworn in on 17 March 2004 following an extensive consultation process based on the CARICOM/OAS plan.\nOn 12 May 2004, discussions took place in Brussels between you and the Commission of the European Communities with a view to examining the political agenda of the Interim Government in relation to the restoration of democratic and constitutional rule. The European Union took note of your commitments particularly as regards the improvements of the human rights situation, the establishment of democratic principles including the holding of free and fair elections, the rule of law and good governance, as stated in your letter of 25 May 2004 to the Commission. Those commitments should lead in due course to greater political stability in Haiti. The European Union strongly urges the Interim Government to translate these commitments rapidly into concrete actions to ensure that the democratisation process becomes an integral part of the Haitian political, economic and social life, thereby ensuring compliance with Article 9 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nIn the light of these elements, the Council of the European Union reviewed its decision of 22 December 2003 and decided to review the appropriate measures referred to in Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement as follows:\n1.\nthe redirection of the remaining funds under the eighth European Development Fund (EDF) to programmes that are of direct benefit to the Haitian people, to strengthen civil society and the private sector, and to support democratisation, the strengthening of the rule of law and the electoral process, will be continued and can also include actions determined as short and medium term priorities in the Interim Cooperation Framework (ICF) established in close cooperation between the Interim Government, civil society and major donors, particularly institutional support;\n2.\nthe allocation of resources under the ninth EDF will be notified upon publication of this Decision in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n;\n3.\ndiscussions on the programming of the ninth EDF resources will start immediately with the National Authorising Officer in view of the preparation of the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) and the National Indicative Programme (NIP). The strategy will take account of the results of the ICF;\n4.\nB-envelope could be used in advance of the signature of the 9th EDF CSP/NIP, according to real needs;\n5.\nthe signature of the NIP is foreseen following national elections respecting the OAS Resolution 822 and accepted as free and fair by the competent Haitian institutions and by the International Community. It is noted that national elections are expected by mid-2005 at the latest;\n6.\ncontribution to regional projects, operations of a humanitarian nature and trade cooperation are not affected.\nAll the above measures shall be reviewed regularly and at least within six months.\nIt is essential for the success of the cooperation to ensure a strengthened absorptive capacity for aid, which is currently lacking, through good governance and aid management capacity building measures. The modalities of implementation will be those adapted to the country's capacity for adequate management of public finances.\nThe European Union will follow closely further developments in the democratisation process, in particular in relation to the achievement of the commitments of the Interim Government and the steps towards local, national and presidential elections. The Union reiterates its readiness to continue enhanced political dialogue with the Haitian Interim Government under Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nPlease accept, Sir, the assurance of our highest consideration.\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council\nThe President\n’""}]}"

(1) Pursuant to Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission may authorise any Member State to introduce exemptions or reductions in the excise duty charged on mineral oils for specific policy considerations.
(2) As public transport is more environmentally friendly than transport in private vehicles, the French authorities have informed the Commission that they wish to introduce a differentiated rate of duty on diesel fuel used in local public passenger transport vehicles by refunding a proportion of future annual rises in duty on diesel fuel.
(3) The other Member States have been informed thereof.
(4) The Commission and all the Member States accept that the application of differentiated rate of excise duty on diesel fuel used in local public passenger transport vehicles will not give rise to distortions of competition or hinder the operation of the internal market.
(5) This Decision does not prejudice the outcome of any future State aid procedures that may be undertaken in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, nor does it override the requirement for Member States to notify instances of potential State aid to the Commission under Article 88 of the Treaty.
(6) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or the operation of the internal market or are incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment.
(7) The French Republic has requested authorisation to introduce the differentiated rate of duty on diesel fuel used in local public passenger transport vehicles from 1 January 2001.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 (2) sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs.
(2) The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has, on a request from the Commission, adopted on 4 April 2006 an updated scientific opinion relating to ochratoxin A (OTA) in food (3), taking into account new scientific information and derived a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 120 ng/kg b.w.
(3) It is foreseen in Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 that the appropriateness of setting a maximum level for OTA in foodstuffs such as dried fruit other than dried vine fruit, cocoa and cocoa products, spices, meat products, green coffee, beer and liquorice, as well as a review of the existing maximum levels, in particular for OTA in dried vine fruit and grape juice, has to be considered in the light of the recent EFSA scientific opinion.
(4) On the basis of the opinion adopted by EFSA, the existing maximum levels appear appropriate to protect public health and have to be retained. As regards the foodstuffs not yet covered by Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, it was considered necessary and appropriate for the protection of public health to establish maximum levels for ochratoxin A in those foodstuffs that are a significant contributor to the exposure of OTA (for the whole population, or for vulnerable group of the population, or for significant part of the population) or for those foodstuffs that are not necessarily a significant contributor to the exposure of OTA, but there is evidence that there can be found a very high level of OTA in these commodities. A maximum level is appropriate to be set in these cases to avoid that those very highly contaminated commodities could enter the food chain.
(5) On the basis of the information available, it does not appear necessary for the protection of public health to set a maximum level of OTA in dried fruit other than dried vine fruit, cocoa and cocoa products, meat products, including edible offal and blood products and liqueur wines as they are not a significant contributor to OTA exposure and high levels of OTA have been found only seldom in those commodities. In the case of green coffee and beer, the presence of OTA is already controlled at another more appropriate stage of the production chain (respectively roasted coffee and malt).
(6) Very high levels of OTA have been observed at several occasions in spices and liquorice. It is therefore appropriate to set a maximum level for spices and liquorice.
(7) There is recent evidence that in some main producing countries of spices exporting to the Union no prevention measures and official controls are in place to control the presence of ochratoxin A in spices. In order to protect public health, it is appropriate to establish without delay a maximum level for ochratoxin A in spices. To enable the producing countries to put prevention measures in place and not to disrupt trade to an unacceptable extent, a higher maximum level, applicable within short notice, is established for a limited period of time, before the maximum level reflecting the level achievable by applying good practices enters into application. It is appropriate that an assessment of the achievability in the different producing regions in the world of the levels for ochratoxin A by applying good practices takes place before the stricter level applies.
(8) It is appropriate to continue the monitoring of OTA in foodstuffs for which no maximum level has been set and in the case of regular findings of unusually high levels of OTA, setting of a maximum level for OTA in those foodstuffs might be considered as appropriate.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Whereas:
1.   PROCEDURE
1.1.   Measures in force
(1) On 15 September 2011 the Council imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of ceramic tiles originating in the People's Republic of China by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 (2) (‘the original Regulation’).
(2) A single duty rate of 26,3 % was imposed on imports of the product concerned manufactured by the following group of exporting producers:
— Dongguan City Wonderful Ceramics Industrial Park Co., Ltd and Guangdong Jiamei Ceramics Co. Ltd (together referred to as the Wonderful group), and
— Qingyuan Gani Ceramics Co. Ltd and Foshan Gani Ceramics Co. Ltd (together referred to as the Gani group).
(3) As set out in recitals 96 to 98 of the original Regulation, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) was notified after disclosure of provisional findings that the relationship between the companies had been severed and on that basis individual duties for the Gani group and for the Wonderful group should have been applied. The request could not be accepted at that stage as its merits needed to be properly examined.
1.2.   Request for a partial interim review
(4) On 2 October 2012 the Commission received a request for a partial interim review from the Gani group.
(5) The Gani group claimed that they were no longer related to the other two companies (the Wonderful group) as the shareholding relationship between them had ceased as of March 2011. The Gani group therefore requested an interim review of the measures in force, as the single duty rate in force was no longer appropriate.
1.3.   Initiation of a partial interim review
(6) The Commission determined, after having consulted the Advisory Committee, that such a review should therefore be opened.
(7) On 31 January 2014, the Commission initiated a partial interim review of the measures in force on imports into the Union of ceramic tiles originating in the People's Republic of China under Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation. It published a Notice of Initiation in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3).
(8) The review was limited in scope to the examination of the ownership structure of the Gani group and, if warranted, ex officio of the dumping margin as far as the Gani group was concerned.
(9) The review also covered ex officio the same matters as far as the Wonderful group was concerned.
1.4.   Review investigation period
(10) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2013 (‘the review investigation period’).
1.5.   Parties concerned by the investigation
(11) The Commission invited both the Gani group and the Wonderful group to cooperate with the investigation and to reply to the Commission's questionnaires. In addition, the Commission provided an opportunity for the companies to request market economy treatment under Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation.
(12) In the Notice of Initiation the Commission had provisionally chosen the United States of America as a third market economy country (‘analogue country’) within the meaning of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation and invited parties to comment on this choice.
(13) Interested parties had an opportunity to comment on the initiation of the investigation and to request a hearing with the Commission and/or the Hearing Officer for trade proceedings.
1.6.   Questionnaire replies and verification visits
(14) The Commission received questionnaire replies from both groups and also from two analogue country producers.
(15) The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the review. Verification visits under Article 16 of the basic Regulation were carried out at the premises of the following companies:
— Exporting producers in the country concerned:
— Dongguan City Wonderful Ceramics Industrial Park Co., Ltd;
— Guangdong Jiamei Ceramics Co. Ltd;
— Qingyuan Gani Ceramics Co. Ltd and
— Foshan Gani Ceramics Co. Ltd
— Producers in the analogue country that requested confidential treatment on the basis of risk of retaliation.
2.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(16) The product subject to this review is the same as defined in the original Regulation, namely glazed and unglazed ceramic flags and paving, hearth or wall tiles; glazed and unglazed ceramic mosaic cubes and the like, whether or not on a backing (‘the product concerned’), currently falling within CN codes 6907 10 00, 6907 90 20, 6907 90 80, 6908 10 00, 6908 90 11, 6908 90 20, 6908 90 31, 6908 90 51, 6908 90 91, 6908 90 93 and 6908 90 99.
3.   DUMPING
3.1.   Market Economy Treatment
(17) Neither group requested market economy treatment under Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
3.2.   Analogue Country
(18) As set out above, the Commission proposed the United States of America as analogue country, as it had been in the previous investigation. The Commission also contacted companies in a number of other possible analogue countries, but received no replies or cooperation from any other company. The choice of the United States of America was therefore confirmed as appropriate.
3.3.   Investigation
(19) The investigation leading to the imposition of the measures in force established that the Gani group and the Wonderful group were related, in so far as one of the shareholders of the Wonderful group owned more than 5 % of the shares in a company in the Gani group. Dumping margins were calculated separately for each of the groups. The injury margins for the two groups were higher than the dumping margins.
(20) To take into account the risk that, due to their corporate links, the companies with the higher individual dumping margin could channel their exports through the companies with the lower dumping margin, a single weighted average dumping margin was then calculated for both groups and a single duty rate imposed.
(21) The Commission examined whether the alleged change in the relationship would render the single duty rate to be no longer justified. Subsequently, the Commission examined the need for the review of the individual dumping margins.
(22) The review investigation revealed that the shares referred to in recital 19 were sold to the owner of the Gani group and the Wonderful group has no longer a stake in the Gani group. There were no indications that the two groups would have any other structural or corporate links. Accordingly, the change of the relationship between the two groups was accepted as claimed and the Gani group and the Wonderful group were considered no longer related for the purposes of specifying the duty.
(23) It follows that there are no longer reasons for the imposition of a single duty rate. Instead, separate individual duty rates should be assigned to the Gani group and the Wonderful group.
(24) As to the need for reviewing the individual dumping margins as calculated for each of the groups in the investigation leading to the imposition of the measures in force, the Commission assessed whether the circumstances with regard to the two groups concerned had changed significantly so that it would warrant the review of these individual dumping margins.
(25) The investigation leading to the imposition of the measures in force established the following:
(1) they did not share production facilities;
(2) they did not share sales companies; and
(3) they did not subcontract for each other.
(26) The review investigation confirmed that this situation remained unchanged despite the change in relationship.
(27) In these specific circumstances, the Commission considered that the cessation of the relationship did not change the functioning of each of the the two groups in any way that has a bearing on the calculation of their dumping margins. Therefore, amending these dumping margins on the basis of new calculations is not warranted under Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation.
(28) In view of the above, the separate dumping margins calculated in the original investigation should be imposed as individual duties. These dumping margins are 13,9 % for the Gani group and 32,0 % for the Wonderful group.
(29) These findings were disclosed to interested parties and they were given time to comment.
(30) The Wonderful group first claimed that they had informed the Commission during the verification visit in the People's Republic of China that some of the evidence submitted by the Gani group in the request for review was false or misleading. They pointed out that the Commission has at its disposal Article 18 of the basic Regulation for this type of situation. They also questioned whether the provisions of Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation had been complied with in this respect.
(31) The Commission has verified all the relevant and duly documented evidence collected during the investigation, which showed that the two groups were no longer related to each other, as well as the evidence with regard to the functioning of each of the two groups, both before and after the cessation of the relationship. This evidence confirms that the group has irrevocably split in two, a fact that is not contested by the Wonderful Group.
(32) On the basis of these facts, the Commission has no ground for applying Article 18 of the basic Regulation. In addition, these facts confirm that Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation was complied with.
(33) Secondly the Wonderful group questioned whether the provision that ‘the amount of the anti-dumping duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping established’ in Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation has been complied with, on the grounds that new export prices and analogue country normal values were verified during this investigation.
(34) As set out in recitals 24 to 27 above, the investigation revealed that the functioning of each of the two groups did not change as a result of the cessation of the relationship. As also explained in the Notice of Initiation, in this case no new dumping margins were required. Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation has been complied with, as the amount of the anti-dumping duty does not exceed the margin of dumping, as established in the original investigation. The fact that new export prices and analogue country normal values were also verified during this investigation does not change this conclusion.
(35) Finally the Wonderful group suggested that ‘giving individual margins to companies which were once related but where that relationship has been ended’ is a dangerous precedent to set and allows for a group of companies to manipulate trade defence measures.
(36) The Commission disagreed with this suggestion. Every review is carried out on its own merits as established by the investigation and not on speculation, and where companies are not related to each other they are entitled to their own individual duty as set out in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(37) The Union industry association Cerame-Unie (CET) argued that the end of the shareholding relationship does not mean that the possibility of circumvention via the group with the lowest duty can be eliminated. To illustrate this, CET noted that the timing of the two groups being split coincided with the imposition of provisional measures in the original case, and that the two groups did not discuss a split prior to the initiation of the original case. During the original investigation the groups were related and therefore CET submitted that the Gani group and the Wonderful group had access to each other's data.
(38) However CET did not provide any evidence to back up these assumptions. In addition, the Commission is under an obligation to impose individual duties on each of the two groups now as it has been established that they are no longer related to each other. The Commission is not entitled to consider two legally separate company groups as related for the purpose of imposing a single duty rate simply because of the mere possibility that the two groups might collaborate together.
(39) CET argued that if the business operations of the two groups have remained unchanged, as has been disclosed, then the risk of circumvention between the two groups must also have remained unchanged.
(40) The Commission dismissed this argument. The only reason why the two groups were treated as one in the original investigation was due to the ownership link, and this fact has now disappeared.
(41) CET also noted that the locations of the production facilities of the two companies are relatively close to each other, which would make physical circumvention of the measures relatively simple.
(42) The Commission dismissed this argument as well. Indeed, there is no legal basis to give unrelated companies the same duty, merely because of the fact that companies are relatively close to each other and therefore circumvention is simpler. It is common in the People's Republic of China to have many producers of a particular product in one city or area.
(43) In view of the above, the comments received after disclosure did not change the conclusion as set out in recital 28 above. Therefore, the separate dumping margins calculated in the original investigation should be imposed as individual duties. These dumping margins are 13,9 % for the Gani group and 32,0 % for the Wonderful group.
(44) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 15(1) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '12.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 67/23', 'title': ""COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/409\nof 11 March 2015\namending Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitely the provisional duty imposed on imports of ceramic tiles originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe table in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 shall be amended as follows:\n—\nthe line below shall be removed from the table:\nCompany\nDuty\nTARIC additional code\n‘Dongguan City Wonderful Ceramics Industrial Park Co., Ltd; Guangdong Jiamei Ceramics Co.

(3) The holder of the authorisation submitted an application requesting a reduction in the authorised withdrawal time from three days to zero days before slaughter and the introduction of maximum residues limits (MRLs) for liver (1,0 mg/kg), kidney (0,8 mg/kg), muscle (0,5 mg/kg) and skin/fat (1,0 mg/kg) from animals fed with the additive. The holder of the authorisation submitted the relevant data to support its request.
(4) The Authority concluded in its opinion of 12 September 2013 (4) that the modification from three days to zero days of withdrawal time does not compromise consumer safety and the new data submitted confirm that no MRLs are necessary.
(5) However, for the purpose of the feasibility of controls, it was considered appropriate to established MRLs as proposed by the applicant.
(6) The conditions provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 are satisfied.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1289/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2)(b)(iii) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) The harmonisation of visa policy is an essential measure in relation to establishing progressively an area of freedom, security and justice, specifically as regards border crossing.
(2) Measure No 38 of the Vienna Action Plan, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 3 December 1998, states that attention must be given to new technical developments in order to ensure where appropriate greater security in the uniform format for visas.
(3) Conclusion No 22 of the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 states that a common active policy on visas and false documents should be further developed.
(4) Member States currently use forms, for affixing visas issued to persons holding travel documents which are not recognised by the Member State drawing up the form, which do not meet the required security standards. For this reason, the format for such forms should be harmonised in order to render them more secure.
(5) This uniform format must contain all the necessary information and meet high technical standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. It must also be suited to use by all Member States and bear universally recognisable harmonised security features which are clearly visible to the naked eye.
(6) This Regulation limits itself to a description of the model for the uniform format. The description must be supplemented by further technical specifications which must remain secret in order to prevent counterfeiting and falsification and which may not include personal data or references to such data. Powers to adopt such further technical specifications should be conferred on the Commission, assisted by the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas(3).
(7) To ensure that the information referred to is not made available to more persons than necessary, each Member State should designate a single body having responsibility for printing the uniform format, while remaining free to change the body, if need be. Each Member State should communicate the name of the competent body to the Commission and the other Member States.
(8) Member States should, in concert with the Commission, implement the necessary measures in order to ensure that the processing of personal data respects the standard of protection referred to in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(4).
(9) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.
(10) This Regulation constitutes in relation to the implementation of the Agreement on the association of Norway and Iceland a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union.
(11) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice by letter of 3 July 2001 of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(12) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation. As a result, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, the provisions of this Regulation do not apply to Ireland.

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement on the European Economic Area (2) (‘the EEA Agreement’) entered into force on 1 January 1994.
(2) Pursuant to Article 98 of the EEA Agreement, the EEA Joint Committee may decide to amend, inter alia, Annexes IV and XXI thereto.
(3) Annexes IV and XXI to the EEA Agreement contain specific provisions and arrangements concerning energy and statistics, respectively.
(4) Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users (3) is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.
(5) Directive 2008/92/EC repeals Council Directive 90/377/EEC of 29 June 1990 concerning a Community procedure to improve the transparency of gas and electricity prices charged to industrial end-users (4) which is incorporated into the EEA Agreement. Directive 90/377/EEC is consequently to be repealed under the EEA Agreement.
(6) Liechtenstein is to be exempted from the obligations foreseen in Directive 2008/92/EC, except for the obligation to provide the industrial price data for industrial end-user band IC for electricity and for industrial end-user band I3 for gas.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

It may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.\n\n((9)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 6 July 2007.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nto Commission Regulation of 5 July 2007 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nRefunds\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n21,55\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09400\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1102\xa020\xa090\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa040\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n27,70\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09300\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n21,55\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09500\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1103\xa013\xa090\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1103\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa060\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa020\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa069\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09110\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09130\nC10\nEUR/t\n20,01\n1104\xa029\xa001\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa003\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa020\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n23,09\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,70\n1104\xa029\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa051\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa055\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n3,85\n1107\xa010\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1107\xa010\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,62\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1109\xa000\xa000\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa051\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,12\n1702\xa030\xa059\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1702\xa030\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,12\n1702\xa030\xa099\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1702\xa040\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n24,12\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n18,47\n1702\xa090\xa075\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n25,28\n1702\xa090\xa079\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n17,54\n2106\xa090\xa055\xa09000\nC14\nEUR/t\n18,47\nNB:\nThe product codes and the ‘A ’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10\n:\nAll destinations\nC14\n:\nAll destinations except for Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n(\n1\n)\nNo refund shall be granted on products given a heat treatment resulting in pregelatinisation of the starch.\n(\n2\n)\nRefunds are granted in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2730/75 (\nOJ L 281, 1.11.1975, p. 20\n), as amended.'}]}"

of 26 July 2002
establishing a Radio Spectrum Policy Group
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2002/622/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community(1) (hereinafter the Radio Spectrum Decision) establishes a policy and legal framework in the Community for radio spectrum policy so as to ensure the coordination of policy approaches and, where appropriate, harmonised conditions with regard to the availability and efficient use of the radio spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market in Community policy areas such as electronic communications, transport and Research and Development.
(2) The Radio Spectrum Decision recalls that the Commission may organise consultations in order to take into account the views of Member States, Community institutions, industry and of all radio spectrum users involved, both commercial and non-commercial, as well as of other interested parties on technological, market and regulatory developments which may relate to the use of radio spectrum.
(3) A consultative group to be called the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (hereinafter the Group) should be established. The Group should assist and advise the Commission on radio spectrum policy issues such as radio spectrum availability, harmonisation and allocation of radio spectrum, provision of information concerning allocation, availability and use of radio spectrum, methods for granting rights to use spectrum, refarming, relocation, valuation and efficient use of radio spectrum as well as protection of human health.
(4) The Group should contribute to the development of a radio spectrum policy in the Community that takes into account not only technical parameters but also economic, political, cultural, strategic, health and social considerations, as well as the various potentially conflicting needs of radio spectrum users with a view to ensuring that a fair, non-discriminatory and proportionate balance is achieved.
(5) The Group should gather high-level governmental experts from the Member States and a high level representative of the Commission. The Group could also include observers and invite other persons to attend meetings as appropriate, including regulators, competition authorities, market participants, user or consumer groups. The Group should therefore allow cooperation between Member States and the Commission in such a way as to contribute to the development of the internal market.
(6) As the focal point for addressing radio spectrum policy issues in the context of all relevant Community policies, close operational links should be maintained between the Group and specific groups or committees established for the implementation of sectoral Community policies including transport policy, internal market policy for radio equipment, audiovisual policy, space policy, and communications.
(7) The Radio Spectrum Decision has created a Radio Spectrum Committee to assist the Commission in the elaboration of binding implementing measures addressing harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum. The work of the Group should not interfere with the work of the Committee.
(8) In order to guarantee effective discussions, each national delegation attending the Group should have a consolidated and coordinated national view of all policies which affect the use of radio spectrum in that Member State in relation not only to the internal market but also to public order, public security, civil protection and defence policies as the use of radio spectrum for such policies may influence the organisation of radio spectrum as a whole. At present, different national government departments have responsibility over different parts of the radio spectrum.
(9) The Group should consult extensively and in a forward-looking manner on technological, market and regulatory developments relating to the use of radio spectrum with all radio spectrum users involved, both commercial and non-commercial, as well as with any other interested parties.
(10) The use of radio spectrum does not stop at borders and given the forthcoming accession of additional Member States, the Group may be opened to these countries and to countries which are members of the European Economic Area.
(11) CEPT (European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications administrations, comprising 44 European countries) should be invited as observer with the work of the Group considering the impact of the activities of the Group on radio spectrum at a pan-European level and considering the technical expertise gained by CEPT and its affiliate bodies in radio spectrum management. It is also appropriate to draw on such expertise on the basis of mandates to be granted pursuant to the Radio Spectrum Decision in view to the development of technical implementing measures in the areas of radio spectrum allocation and information availability. In view of the importance of European standardisation for the development of equipment using radio spectrum, it is likewise important to associate as observer the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute (ETSI),","{'title': '2002/622/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2002 establishing a Radio Spectrum Policy Group (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nSubject matter\n\nAn advisory group on radio spectrum policy, called the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (hereinafter referred to as the Group), is hereby established.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nAims\n\nThe Group shall assist and advise the Commission on radio spectrum policy issues, on coordination of policy approaches and, where appropriate, on harmonised conditions with regard to the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum necessary for the establishment and functioning of the internal market.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nMembership\n\nThe Group shall be composed of one high level governmental expert from each Member State as well as of a high-level representative from the Commission.\n\nThe Commission shall provide the secretariat to the Group.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': ""Article 4\n\nOperational arrangements\n\nAt the Commission's request or at its own initiative, the Group shall adopt opinions to be addressed to the Commission, upon consensus or, if not possible, on the basis of a simple majority, each member having one vote except the Commission which shall not vote.

- 100 tonnes of fresh table grapes falling within CN code ex 0806 10 15, originating in the Canary Islands, for the period 1 January to 31 March;
Whereas, where the said products are imported into that part of Spain which is included in the customs territory of the Community, they qualify for exemption from customs duties and are not subject to observance of the reference price; whereas, where the said products are imported into Portugal, the quota duties aplicable are to be calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Act of Accession; whereas, where the said products are released for free circulation in the remainder of the customs territory of the Community, they qualify for the progressive reduction of customs duties according to the same timetable and under the same conditions as those provided for in Article 75 of the Act of Accession, provided that for fresh table grapes the reference prices are observed; whereas, to qualify for the tariff quotas, the products in question have to comply with certain marking and labelling conditions designed to prove their origin;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas however, since the quotas are to cover requirements which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy, they should not be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under conditions and according to a procedure to be determined; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used and inform the Member States accordingly;

Having regard to Directive 1999/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 6(2)(b) of Directive 1999/62/EC of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, Member States may apply reduced rates or exemptions for vehicles which travel only occasionally on the public roads of the Member State of registration and are used by natural or legal persons whose main occupation is not the carriage of goods, provided that the transport operations carried out by these vehicles do not cause distortions of competition. This reduction or exemption is subject to the Commission's agreement.
(2) France has requested the Commission to agree on the exemption from the vehicle tax according to Directive 1999/62/EC for vehicles of 12 tonnes or more, which are used exclusively in connection with public and industrial works in France.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 19 January 2006
accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China
(2006/109/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports into the Community of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
(2) Upon publication of the definitive Regulation, no undertakings could be accepted by the Commission. During the investigation leading to the imposition of definitive measures several exporting producers had indicated their intention to offer a price undertaking but they had failed to submit sufficiently substantiated undertaking offers within the deadlines set in Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. Nevertheless, as set out in recital 152 of the definitive Regulation, the Council, in view of the complexity of the issue for the economic operators in question (predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises) and given that the definitive disclosure was not preceded by a provisional disclosure, considered that they should exceptionally be allowed to complete their undertaking offers beyond the said deadline.
B.   UNDERTAKING
(3) Subsequent to the abovementioned deadline, the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME) together with 20 cooperating Chinese companies or cooperating groups of companies, including the related importer of one of the groups (the companies) offered a joint undertaking. The undertaking stipulates that a breach by any of the companies or the CCCME shall be considered as a breach of the undertaking by all signatories. However, given that the resales of the related importer in the Community are not under the aegis of the CCCME, any violation by that related importer or its related exporters in the PRC shall be considered as a breach only from that particular group. The undertaking offer was supported by the Chinese authorities.
(4) According to this undertaking, the CCCME and the companies undertake to ensure that the product concerned is exported at or above a minimum price set at a level that eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. In addition, the offer made foresees the indexation of the minimum price of the product concerned in accordance with public international quotations for its main raw material, i.e. pig iron, given that the casting prices vary significantly depending on the prices of pig iron.
(5) In view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the joint undertaking offered by the CCCME and the companies can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover, the regular and detailed reports which the CCCME and the companies undertook to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring, and it is considered that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited.
(6) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) 268/2006 (3). This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty established in the above-mentioned Regulation will instead be payable.
(7) To further ensure the effective respect of the undertaking, the importers have been made aware by the above Council Regulation that any violation of the undertaking may lead to the retrospective application of the anti-dumping duty for the relevant transaction.
(8) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking, or in case of a withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '17.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 47/59', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 19 January 2006\naccepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China\n(2006/109/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertaking offered by China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME) and the cooperating producers mentioned in the table, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China is hereby accepted.\nCompany\nTaric additional code\nBeijing Tongzhou Dadusche Foundry Factory, East of Dongtianyang Village, Dadushe, Tongzhou Beijing\nA708\nBotou City Simencun Town Bai Fo Tang Casting Factory, Bai Fo Tang Village, Si Men Cun Town, Bo Tou City, 062159, Hebei Province\nA681\nBotou City Wangwu Town Tianlong Casting Factory, Changle Village, Wangwu Town, Botou City, Hebei Province\nA709\nChangan Cast Limited Company of Yixian Hebei, Taiyuan main street, Yi County, Hebei Province, 074200\nA683\nChangsha Jinlong Foundry Industry Co., Ltd, 260 Jinchang Road, JinJing Town, Changsha, Hunan\nA710\nChangsha Lianhu Foundry, Lianhu Village, Yuhuating Town, Yuhua District, Changsha, Hunan\nA711\nManufactured and sold by GB Metal Products Co., Ltd, Zhuanlu Town, Dingzhou, Hebei or manufactured by GB Metal Products Co., Ltd, Zhuanlu Town, Dingzhou, Hebei and sold by its related sales company GB International Trading Shanghai Co., Ltd, B301-310 Yinhai Building, 250 Cao Xi Road, Shanghai\nA712\nGuiyang Bada Foundry Co., Ltd, Mengguan Huaxi Guiyang, Guizhou\nA713\nHebei Jize Xian Ma Gang Cast Factory, Nankai District.

Whereas:
(1) Article 16(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4), provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2010/2003(6), shall apply as regards exports of products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty.
(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' arrival at destination.
(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(7) provides, on an autonomous basis, for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Malta, from 1 November 2003.

Whereas the marketing of provisionally preserved raspberries falling within subheading ex 08.11 E of the Common Customs Tariff is characterized by competition from non-member countries at prices significantly below the prices at which Community products can be marketed; whereas there is a failure to comply with the price levels agreed with the main non-member supplier countries for the 1985/86 marketing year; whereas imports in 1985 were significantly higher than the average for the last three years;
Whereas in these circumstances the Community market is exposed to serious disturbances which might endanger the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas it is therefore necessary to apply protective measures;
Whereas the aim of the protective measures should be to exclude the marketing of imported products at abnormally low prices;
Whereas this objective can be achieved by introducing a minimum import price to be respected on import into the Community and by applying countervailing charges on products which do not respect that price; whereas the countervailing charges should be calculated on the basis of the prices applied by supplier countries;
Whereas the minimum import price may be undercut due to events which are not a consequence of prices applied by non-member countries, e.g. fluctuation of exchange rates; whereas that fact should be taken into consideration when countervailing charges are fixed;

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Bacitracin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) Sulphur should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC(3) of the European Parliament and of the Council to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine. The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 11 December 2012 (2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use may be considered as an effective source of selenium for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) The Authority concluded that the limitation of the supplementation with organic selenium should apply to the already authorised organic selenium compounds, the selenised yeasts, and hydroxy-analogue of selenomethionine. Thus, in case inorganic compounds of selenium are also added to the feed, the supplementation with organic selenium should not exceed 0,2 mg per kg complete feed.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(2) provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) The United Kingdom still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the United Kingdom intervention agency available on the internal market and a standing invitation to tender should be opened.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender.
(6) When the United Kingdom intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.

(4) Commission Decision 2008/557/EC of 27 June 2008 on a financial contribution from the Community towards emergency measures to combat avian influenza in Poland in 2007 (3) provided for a financial contribution by the Union towards emergency measures to combat avian influenza in Poland in 2007.
(5) Poland submitted an official request for reimbursement on 13 March 2008 as set out in Article 7(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(6) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 makes the payment of that financial contribution from the Union subject to the condition that the planned activities were actually implemented and that the authorities provided all the necessary information within the set deadlines.
(7) Decision 2008/557/EC provided that a first tranche of EUR 845 000 should be paid as part of the Union’s financial contribution.
(8) An audit according to Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 carried out by the Commission’s services did reveal only minor financial issues.

The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1062/2001 of 31 May 2001 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 June 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 May 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(4) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 3.\n\n(5) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 55.\n\n(6) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 25.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 May 2001 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2032/2000 (OJ L 243, 28.9.2000, p. 14).\n\nC01: All destinations except Poland.'}]}"

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 45(2)(e) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 provides rules on the use of the VIS for consultation and requests for documents. In implementation of Article 16 of the VIS Regulation, measures should be adopted to set out rules for the exchange of the messages transmitted by the infrastructure of the VIS (VIS Mail Specifications). These messages shall not be recorded in the VIS and the personal data transmitted shall be used solely for the consultation of central visa authorities and consular cooperation.
(2) Subject to further measures adopted by the date referred to in Article 46 of the VIS Regulation concerning the integration of the technical functionalities of the Schengen Consultation Network, the VIS Mail Specifications should define four types of messages which may be used from the start of operations of VIS until the date referred to in Article 46 of the VIS Regulation. These should include messages related to consular cooperation (Article 16(3) of the VIS Regulation), messages related to the transmission of requests to the competent visa authority to forward copies of travel documents and other documents supporting the application and to the transmission of electronic copies of those documents (Article 16(3) of the VIS Regulation), messages that data processed in the VIS are inaccurate or that data were processed in the VIS contrary to the provisions of the VIS Regulation (Article 24(2) of the VIS Regulation) and messages that an applicant has acquired the nationality of a Member State (Article 25(2) of the VIS Regulation).
(3) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, on 13 October 2008 Denmark decided to implement Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in Danish law. Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 is thus binding upon Denmark in international law. Denmark has therefore an obligation under international law to implement this Decision.
(4) In accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (2), the United Kingdom has not taken part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application as it constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom is therefore not an addressee of this Commission Decision.
(5) In accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (3), Ireland has not taken part in the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and is not bound by it or subject to its application as it constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Ireland is therefore not an addressee of this Commission Decision.
(6) This Decision constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession.
(7) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters’ association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis

 (5).
(8) As regards Switzerland, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC (6) on the conclusion of that Agreement on behalf of the European Community.
(9) As regards Liechtenstein, this Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC of 28 February 2008 on the signature, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis

of VIS Mail and VISION implies a phased process as depicted below:\nBefore VIS becomes operational, VISION shall be the unique communication network for consultations on visas\n(\n1\n)\n.\nIn Phase 1, from the start of operations of VIS, the VIS Mail mechanism may be used for transmission of following types of information:\n—\nmessages related to consular cooperation,\n—\nrequests for supporting documents,\n—\nmessages on inaccurate data,\n—\nMember State nationality acquired by an applicant.\nThe provisions of the VIS Regulation concerning the use of VIS Mail for the transmission of information relating to consular cooperation and requests for supporting documents (Article 16(3)), for the amendment of data (Article 24(2)) and for advance data deletion (Article 25(2)) are applicable in Phase 1. The VIS Mail mechanism, including the central mail relay and the national mail servers, needs to be in place in case at least one Member State intends to use the mechanism in Phase 1 to ensure that this Member State is able to transmit such messages\n(\n2\n)\n. During Phase 1 of the VIS Mail operation, VISION shall be used in parallel.\nIn Phase 2, when all the Schengen visa issuing posts are connected to VIS, the VIS Mail mechanism shall replace the Schengen Consultation Network from the date determined in accordance with Article 46 of the VIS Regulation. As from this date all types of messages shall be exchanged via the VIS infrastructure by means of the VIS Mail mechanism.\n2.\nSMTP Mail Exchange Infrastructure\nThe SMTP mail exchange shall use the VIS infrastructure, which includes national interfaces and the sTESTA network, and shall be based on national mail servers exchanging messages via a central mail relay infrastructure.\nThe central SMTP mail relay infrastructure shall be developed and installed in the VIS Central Unit and Back-up Central Unit sites. The management and monitoring of the mail relay including logging shall be provided by the Management Authority.\nThe national SMTP mail server infrastructure shall be prepared by the Member States. The national mail server infrastructure needs to be protected against unauthorised access to the messages.\n3.\nApplication Solution\nThe VIS Mail operations shall start in Phase 1 with business processes developed taking into account the technical solution of VISION to ensure a smooth switch-over between Phases 1 and 2 when VIS Mail will replace VISION.\nTechnical specifications describing the functionalities of the VIS Mail mechanism shall be without prejudice to the legal aspects of consular cooperation and visa procedures.\n(\n1\n)\nThis network is used for consultations between Member States, including representation, and for the exchange of information that a visa with limited territorial validity (VLTV) has been issued.\n(\n2\n)\nThe fact that the VIS Mail mechanism may be used concerns the optional use of the mechanism itself, not the availability of the tool, which is then obligatory.'}]}"

Whereas equidae, being live animals, are included in the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty;
Whereas in order to ensure the rational development of equidae production, thereby increasing productivity in the sector, rules governing intra-Community trade in equidae intended for competitions must be laid down at Community level;
Whereas the breeding and rearing of equidae and in particular of horses is generally included in the farming sector; whereas it constitutes a source of income for part of the farming population;
Whereas there are disparities in the Community as regards the rules for access to competitions; whereas those disparities constitute a barrier to intra-Community trade;
Whereas trade in equidae intended for competitions and participation in such competitions may be jeopardized by disparities existing in the rules concerning the allocation of a percentage of the prize money or profits for the safeguard, development and improvement of breeding in the Member States; whereas introducing free access to the competitions presupposes harmonization of these rules;
Whereas, pending such harmonization, in order, in particular, to maintain or increase productivity in that sector, Member States should be authorized to reserve a percentage of prize money or profits for the safeguard, development and improvement of their breeding activities; whereas, however, a ceiling should be fixed for that percentage;
Whereas it is advisable to adopt implementing measures regarding certain technical aspects; whereas, for the purposes of the planned measures, provision should be made for close and effective cooperation between Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Zootechnics,","{'title': 'Council Directive 90/428/EEC of 26 June 1990 on trade in equidae intended for competitions and laying down the conditions for participation therein', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Directive lays down the conditions governing trade in equidae intended for competitions and the conditions governing their participation therein.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, the definitions set out in Article 2 of Council Directive 90/427/EEC of 26 June 1990 on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae (4) shall apply.\n\nFurthermore, 'competition' means any equestrian competition, including horse racing, show-jumping, eventing, dressage, events reserved for horse-drawn vehicles and showing classes.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 (1), and in particular Articles 70(3) and 105(1) thereof; and Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (2) and in particular Article 103(3) thereof; and Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (3) and in particular Articles 74(4) and 92 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The legal framework for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section, the Financial Instrument for the Fisheries Guidance (hereinafter ‘the Structural Funds’) and for the Cohesion Fund is largely established although it has been subject to frequent adjustments. Programming involves the preparation of multiannual development plans in several stages, with each stage constituting a 7-year period. Each programming period is governed by a set of individual Regulations which are based on the same general principles but introduce certain new rules specifically designed for the programming period concerned. The relevant provisions governing the 2007-2013 programming period are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1828/2006 of 8 December 2006 setting out rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund (4), Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 498/2007 of 26 March 2007 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (5), Commission Regulation (EC) No 1848/2006 of 14 December 2006 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the common agricultural policy and the organisation of an information system in this field and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 595/91 (6) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1975/2006 of 7 December 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, as regards the implementation of control procedures as well as cross-compliance in respect of rural development support measures (7).
(2) The relevant provisions governing the 2000-2006 programming period are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds (8) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 16 May 1994 establishing a Cohesion Fund (9). Commission Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 of 11 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the structural policies and the organization of an information system in this field (10) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 of 26 July 1994 concerning irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of the Cohesion Fund and the organization of an information system in this field (11) established rules as to irregularities and the recovery of sums wrongly paid in connection with the financing of policies by the Funds, and applied to that programming period. Those Regulations established reporting requirements in case of detected irregularities. Those requirements resulted in a disproportionate administrative burden on Member States and the Commission.
(3) By virtue of Article 28(1) of the Protocol Concerning the conditions and arrangements for admission of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union (12), measures which on the date of accession have been subject to assistance under Council Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 of 21 June 1999 establishing an Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-accession (13) (ISPA) not completed by that date are considered to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 and all provisions governing the implementation of measures approved pursuant to the latter Regulation apply to those measures. Concerning ex-ISPA projects, this Decision should therefore also be addressed to Bulgaria and Romania.
(4) Accordingly, in order to reduce the burden imposed on Member States and to improve efficiency, Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2035/2005 (14) and Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2168/2005 (15) so that, for the 2000-2006 programming period, Member States do not need to report cases where the irregularity consists solely of the failure to partially or totally execute an operation co-financed by the Union budget owing to the bankruptcy of the final beneficiary or the final recipient, and which do not involve other irregularities preceding the bankruptcy or suspected fraud (hereinafter referred to as ‘simple bankruptcies’).
(5) While Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 as amended and Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 as amended simplified the existing reporting system, the simplifications introduced did not extend to the requirement relating to the submission of the special report referred to in Article 5(2) of both Regulations. Experience of dealing with reported irregularities, and examining the special reports submitted, in particular for the 1994-1999 programming period, has shown that the administrative burden for the Member States in applying the provisions of Article 5(2) of both Regulations to simple bankruptcies is disproportionate, given that it is highly unlikely that the failure to recover in such cases results from the fault or negligence of the authorities of the Member State.
(6) In order to give full effect, therefore, to the aims of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 as amended and Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 as amended, it is appropriate to extend that simplification to the requirement to submit a special report under Article 5(2) of both Regulations so that Member States which are benefiting from the simplification provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of those Regulations equally benefit from the simplification of the requirement to report under Article 5(2).
(7) While the legal framework governing the Structural Funds as well as the Cohesion Fund and the irregular use thereof is clearly identifiable by programming period, the identification of disproportionate administrative requirements in the established reporting system is only possible at the closure of a given programming period. Therefore, in order to effectively assess and improve the reporting system, a certain period of time was necessary.
(8) Further efforts to simplify the reporting obligations were introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2035/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 2168/2005 amending, respectively, Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 and Regulation (EC) No 1831/94. Most notably, the reporting threshold laid down in both Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 and Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 was raised from EUR 4 000 to EUR 10 000. Given the short period of time between the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 2035/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 2168/2005 and the end of the 2000-2006 programming period, however, the intended simplification of the reporting system could not be fully achieved for that programming period, thus necessitating the elimination of the reporting obligations for cases involving an amount of less than EUR 10 000 which were notified before 28 February 2006.
(9) For reasons of equal treatment, therefore, all reporting obligations with regard to the irregular use of the Structural Funds and of the Cohesion Fund should benefit from the raised threshold and the intended simplification of the reporting system introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 as amended and Regulation (EC) No 1831/94 as amended.
(10) This Decision is without prejudice to the obligation for Member States to take all appropriate measures to recover amounts unduly paid and to account to the Commission for amounts which are recovered.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Coordination Committee of the Funds, the European Fisheries Fund Committee and of the Rural Development Committee,","{'header': '23.12.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 341/49', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 21 December 2010\nexempting certain cases of irregularity arising from operations co-financed by the Structural Funds and by the Cohesion Fund for the 2000-2006 programming period from the special reporting requirements laid down by Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1681/94 and by Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/94\n(notified under document C(2010) 9244)\n(2010/802/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The legal framework for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guidance Section, the Financial Instrument for the Fisheries Guidance (hereinafter ‘the Structural Funds’) and for the Cohesion Fund is largely established although it has been subject to frequent adjustments.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(1)(b)(ii) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 lays down the general principles governing food and feed in general, and food and feed safety in particular, at Community and national level. It provides for emergency measures where it is evident that food or feed imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment, and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.
(2) Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products (2) provides that the production process of animals and primary products of animal origin is to be monitored for the purpose of detecting the presence of certain residues and substances in live animals, their excrements and body fluids and in tissue, animal products, animal feed and drinking water. Article 29 of Directive 96/23/EC requires that guarantees provided by third countries must have an effect at least equivalent to those provided for in this Directive.
(3) The results of the latest Community inspection visit to India have revealed shortcomings as regards the residue control system in live animals and animal products.
(4) Despite guarantees provided by India, Member States report to the Commission increased findings of nitrofurans and their metabolites in crustaceans imported from India and intended for human consumption or animal feed. The presence of those substances in food is forbidden by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 (3) and they present a serious risk for human health.
(5) These products of animal origin are also used in the manufacturing of feed for aquaculture animals. Nitrofurans or their metabolites are not authorised as feed additive following provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). In addition, such products of animal origin which contain nitrofurans used as antibacterial substances are excluded from feed for farmed animals, since they are category 2 animal by-products in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).
(6) Therefore it is appropriate to adopt, at Community level, certain emergency measures applicable to importations of crustaceans of aquaculture origin from India in order to ensure the effective and uniform protection of human health in all Member States.
(7) Accordingly, Member States should allow importations of crustaceans of aquaculture origin from India only if it can be shown that they have been subjected to an analytical test at origin to verify that the concentration of nitrofurans or their metabolites are not in excess of the decision limit of the confirmatory analytical method used, in accordance with Commission Decision 2002/657/EC (6).
(8) However, it is appropriate to authorise the importation of consignments that are not accompanied by the results of the analytical tests at origin, provided that the importing Member State ensures that those are tested on arrival at the Community border and kept under the official control until the results become available.
(9) This Decision should be reviewed in the light of the guarantees offered by India and on the basis of the results of the analytical tests carried out by the Member States.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.10.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 258/31', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 September 2009\non emergency measures applicable to crustaceans imported from India and intended for human consumption or animal feed\n(notified under document C(2009) 7388)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/727/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 lays down the general principles governing food and feed in general, and food and feed safety in particular, at Community and national level.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands with regard to certain agricultural products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(2) and in particular Article 3(4), Article 4(4), Article 5(2) and Article 6(2) and the third paragraph of Article 8 thereof,
(1) Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2790/94(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 825/98(4), lays down common detailed rules for the implementation of the specific arrangements for the supply of certain agricultural products to the Canary Islands; whereas the adjustments that experience has shown to be necessary should be made and the Regulation should be amended in the interests of clarity and administrative efficiency;
(2) Whereas Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 does not state the reason why proof that import licences, exemption certificates and aid certificates as provided for in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of that Regulation have been charged must be presented within six working days of completion of the customs formalities;
(3) Whereas the provisions of Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 are nonetheless related to those of Article 3(1) thereof, which stipulates that aid is to be paid on presentation of a fully utilised aid certificate; whereas operators who present aid certificates more than six working days after completion of the customs formalities should accordingly forfeit their entitlement to the aid;
(4) Whereas it is difficult in practice for operators to comply with the time limit of six working days following completion of the customs formalities provided for in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 for the presentation of proof that import licences and exemption and aid certificates have been charged;
(5) Whereas, as a consequences, the provisions of Article 3(1) and Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 should be clarified, on the one hand, and conditions more in line with normal practice should be laid down regarding the time limit for presentation of aid applications and penalties applying cases where that time limit is not met, on the other hand;
(6) Whereas the introduction in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 of a time limite for presentation of aid applications that can normally be met and of proportionality in penalties applicable to operators not meeting the time limit for returning certificates will simplify the procedure for paying the aid without depriving the authorities of the instruments they need to ensure that the aims of the arrangements are met, i.e. in particular to guarantee regular supplies of certain agricultural products and to offset the effects of the islands' geographical situation by effectively passing on the benenfits granted, right through to the placing on the market of the products intended for local consumption;
(7) Whereas the time limit provided for in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2790/94 is confusing since it may be interpreted as laying down a condition for entitlement to the Community aid; whereas it no longer seems worthwhile to maintain that time limit for the purposes of sound administration of the arrangements since such administration is now fully computerised; whereas that time limit should accordingly be done away with and reference made solely to the time limit laid down in Article 3(1) of that Regulation for the payment of the aid;

fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2162/2002 of 5 December 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 6 December 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 5 December 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Whereas:
(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prohibits the use and the placing on the market of chlorofluorocarbons.
(2) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 states that, following a request of a Member State and in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 18(2), the Commission may authorise the use of chlorofluorocarbons until 31 December 2004 in delivery mechanisms for hermetically-sealed devices designed for implantation in the human body for delivery of measured doses of medication.
(3) Medtronic is a producer of the Isomed infusion system, an implantable drug-delivery system that is used for the treatment of cancer pain, non-malignant pain, spasticity and cancer chemotherapy. The Isomed device utilises a minute quantity of CFC-114 to create the pressure to deliver the medication. To date there is no alternative to the CFC but Medtronic is seeking an alternative. As the pump is implanted in the body there is no escapee of CFC into the environment during the use of this device.
(4) The Commission has examined the technical and economic aspects of the Isomed infusion system produced by Medtronic and accepts that currently there is no technical and economically feasible alternative substance or technology and that the temporary use of CFCs in these drug pumps for medical uses remains essential.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC (1), and in particular Article 7(3) in conjunction with Article 60(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 obliges manufacturers of construction products to draw up a declaration of performance when a construction product that is covered by a harmonised standard or conforms to a European Technical Assessment issued for that product is placed on the market. A copy of that declaration should be supplied either in paper form or by electronic means.
(2) In accordance with Article 7(3) and Article 60(b) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011, the Commission is delegated the task of setting out the conditions governing the electronic processing of the declarations of performance in order that they may be made available on a website. Those conditions for making the declarations of performance available online permit the use of new information technologies and reduce costs to manufacturers of construction products and the construction sector as a whole.
(3) Taking into account the potential specific needs of the recipients of construction products, especially the micro-enterprises amongst them, and in particular those operating in construction sites without internet access, this delegated act should not be extended to comprise any derogation from Article 7(2) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.
(4) In order to ensure that the electronic form of a declaration of performance corresponding to a particular product is readily identifiable, manufacturers should link every single product, or batch of the same product, they are placing on the market to a given declaration of performance by means of the unique identification code of the product-type, which should be mentioned in the declaration of performance in accordance with Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.
(5) For the purpose of alleviating the administrative burden involved in the provision of declarations of performance, while also ensuring the continued reliability of the information provided in such declarations, the electronic form of a declaration of performance should not be altered after it has been made available online and should remain accessible for at least a period of 10 years after the construction product has been placed on the market or such other period that may apply by virtue of the second subparagraph of Article 11(2) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011.
(6) The website on which the declaration of performance is made available should be subject to monitoring and maintenance to ensure, insofar as possible, that it is kept continuously accessible and does not become unavailable as a result of technical malfunction.
(7) The website on which the declaration of performance is made available should be accessible free of charge to the recipients of construction products. Those recipients should be instructed on how to access the website and the electronic form of the declaration of performance.
(8) In order to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the European construction sector as a whole, economic operators providing declarations of performance wishing to benefit from new information technologies for the purposes of facilitating the provision of such declarations should be able to do so as soon as possible,","{'header': '21.2.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 52/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 157/2014\nof 30 October 2013\non the conditions for making a declaration of performance on construction products available on a website', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 obliges manufacturers of construction products to draw up a declaration of performance when a construction product that is covered by a harmonised standard or conforms to a European Technical Assessment issued for that product is placed on the market.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 20 December 1990  concerning applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain the imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America  (Quantum Chemical Corporation)  (Only  the English and Dutch texts are authentic)  (91/165/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 (2) amended Regulation (EEC) No 1282/81 (3) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America. Anti-dumping duty of 5,9 % was applied to the  American company US Industrial Chemical Co., later to become Quantum Chemical Corporation, to which the 5,9 % duty was declared to be applicable by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2166/89 (4).
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 490/90 (5) repealed Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States. Thus, since 2 March 1990, anti-dumping duty can no  longer be imposed on imports of vinyl acetate monomer.
(3) Commission Decision 90/461/EEC (6), which sets out the details of the case, the procedure, and the arguments of the applicant, refunded part of the anti-dumping duties paid by Quantum Chemical Europe BV, Bavel, Netherlands (hereinafter referred to  as 'Quantum'), in respect of the import in the period May 1988 to March 1989 of vinyl acetate monomer produced and exported by the Quantum Chemical Corporation. The Decision stated that Quantum's applications for the period 1 April 1989 to 1 March 1990,  the expiry date of the anti-dumping duty applied, would be examined before a further decision was taken.
(4) For this second period, Quantum, which imported into the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, submitted recurring applications for the sums of Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ] (7).
(5) The applicant was informed of the results of the examination after the evidence adduced had been verified and had the opportunity to submit its comments.
(6) In the notified English and Dutch versions of the abovementioned Decision, a clerical error was found concerning the sums to be refunded. The applicant was told that this error would be rectified in that Decision.
(7) Pursuant to Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the applications' admissibility and merits. No Member State raised any objection.
B. ADMISSIBILITY
(8) The applications are admissible in that they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular with regard to time limits.
C. MERITS OF THE CLAIM
(9) The recurring applications concerning the duties paid on imports of vinyl acetate monomer between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 appear to be well founded The actual dumping margin, calculated as for the previous decision according to the method used  during the first investigation, was nil.
Accordingly, Quantum's applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties paid on imports into the Community of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 must be granted.
D. AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED
(10) The sums of Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ] are therefore to be refunded to Quantum.
(11) A correction must also be made to notified Decision No 90/461/EEC of 6 August 1990. The sums indicated in the notified versions were not those indicated to the applicant before the Decision was taken and included in the subsequent translation of  the original Decision.
The amounts to be refunded by way of anti-dumping duties paid for the period March 1988 - March 1989 actually totalled Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ], and not Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ] as indicated in the notified version of Decision 90/461/EEC.  Decision 90/461/EEC must therefore be amended. This means that the Dutch authorities must refund a further Fl [ . . . ] to the applicant under Decision 90/461/EEC. The notified version of the same Decision awarded £ [ . . . ] too much. The United  Kingdom authorities have notified the Commission that they had refunded only £ [ . . . ] under this Decision and would not therefore need to proceed to recovery.","{'title': '91/165/EEC: Commission Decision of 20 December 1990 concerning applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain the imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (Quantum Chemical Corporation) (Only the English and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nQuantum's applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties totalling Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ] submitted in respect of the period between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 are hereby granted.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe sums of Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ] indicated in paragraph (11) above and the notified English and Dutch versions of Article 2 of Commission Decision 90/461/EEC shall be corrected to read: Fl [ . . . ] and £ [ . . . ].'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe sum of Fl [ . . . ] shall be refunded by the Netherlands authorities, that of £ [ . . . ] by the United Kingdom authorities.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Quantum Chemical Europe BV, Bavel, the Netherlands.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 1990.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 213, 4. 8. 1987, p. 32.\n\n(3) OJ No L 129, 15. 5. 1981, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ No L 208, 20. 7. 1989, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ No L 53, 1. 3. 1990, p. 1.\n\n(6) OJ No L 240, 3. 9. 1990, p. 21.\n\n(7) In accordance with Article  8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, which deals with the non-disclosure of business secrets, certain figures have been omitted from the published version of this Decision.'}]}"

Whereas the production of cheeses, the prices of which are bound within GATT, forms the principal use of milk in mountainous regions ; whereas their production is subject to considerable seasonal fluctuations ; whereas prices do not move in harmony with these fluctuations because of imports made at the prices bound within GATT at a level below the threshold price ; whereas, in the absence of a sufficient seasonal price increase, there is not enough incentive to voluntary storage to stabilise the market in those cheeses over the year ; whereas, to correct this situation and to avoid disturbance of the market, provision should be made for granting aid for private storage;
Whereas certain cheeses manufactured from sheep's milk and needing at least six months for maturing may, because of the long interval between production and sale, suffer a price imbalance that likewise makes aid for private storage necessary;
Whereas the Council must adopt general rules for the granting of aid ; whereas these should relate only to cheeses which reach standards to be laid down ; whereas the intervention agency is responsible for implementation of the provisions of this Regulation ; whereas, to ensure uniformity of the system in the Community, the storage contract should be drawn up in accordance with Community provisions and there should be a uniform method of calculating the amount of aid according to the cost of storage;
Whereas private storage must contribute to the attainment of a balanced market ; whereas Community rules should be provided to ensure the orderly functioning of this form of storage;","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 508/71 of the Council of 8 March 1971 laying down general rules on private storage aid for long-keeping cheeses', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 92/260/EEC(2) lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses.
(2) Commission Decision 93/197/EEC(3), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production.
(3) Annex I to Commission Decision 97/10/EC of 12 December 1996 amending Council Decision 79/542/EEC and Commission Decisions 92/160/EEC, 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC in relation to the temporary admission and imports into the Community of registered horses from South Africa(4) provides for additional guarantees which apply to the regionalisation of South Africa for imports of registered horses into the European Community.
(4) Those additional guarantees prohibit the use of vaccination against African horse sickness within the African horse sickness free area. Consequently, the vaccination status of registered horses which have been resident in the African horse sickness free area for more than 24 months can no longer be certified under the current import conditions.
(5) In addition it is necessary to make the transportation of registered horses into the free area subject to authorisation in cases where such horses have not been vaccinated or where for veterinary reasons such vaccination was not carried out in compliance with all instructions of the manufacturer.
(6) It is necessary to adapt the additional guarantees for the regionalisation of South Africa for imports into the Community of registered horses in the light of the animal health situation in that country, and to reflect these modifications in the animal health conditions and veterinary certification applicable to such importation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in eggs that the refund should be fixed at an amount which would permit Community participation in world trade and would also take account of the nature of these exports and their importance at the present time.
(3) The present market situation in certain third countries and that regarding competition makes it necessary to fix a refund differentiated by destination for certain products in the egg sector.
(4) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (2), stipulates that no refund is granted if the products are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the date on which the export declaration is accepted. In order to ensure uniform application of the rules in force, it should be stated that, in order to qualify for the refund, the egg products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 must bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 89/437/EEC of 20 June 1989 on hygiene and health problems affecting the production and the placing on the market of egg products (3).
(5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished. That abolition should not, however, lead to a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

on temporary measures relating to the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Irish Government
(ECB/2011/4)
(2011/227/EU)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first indent of Article 127(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), and in particular Article 12.1 and the second indent of Article 34.1, in conjunction with the first indent of Article 3.1 and Article 18.2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro may conduct credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants, with lending being based on adequate collateral. The criteria determining the eligibility of collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem monetary policy operations are laid down in Annex I to Guideline ECB/2000/7 of 31 August 2000 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (1) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘General Documentation’).
(2) Pursuant to Section 1.6 of the General Documentation, the Governing Council of the ECB may, at any time, change the instruments, conditions, criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Pursuant to Section 6.3.1 of the General Documentation, the Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils its requirements for high credit standards on the basis of any information it may consider relevant.
(3) There are exceptional circumstances prevailing in the financial market, arising from the fiscal position of the Irish Government in the context of an adjustment plan supported by the euro area Member States and the International Monetary Fund, and there is a disruption of the normal assessment by the market of securities issued by the Irish Government, with negative effects on the stability of the financial system. This exceptional situation requires a swift and temporary adaptation of the Eurosystem monetary policy framework.
(4) The Governing Council has assessed the fact that the Irish Government has approved an economic and financial adjustment programme which it has negotiated with the European Commission, the ECB and the International Monetary Fund, as well as the strong commitment of the Irish Government to fully implement such programme. The Governing Council has also assessed and endorsed the implementation of the programme by the Irish Government until now. The Governing Council has also assessed, from a Eurosystem credit risk management perspective, the effects of such a programme on the securities issued by the Irish Government. The Governing Council considers the programme to be appropriate, so that, from a credit risk management perspective, the marketable debt instruments issued by the Irish Government or guaranteed by the Irish Government retain a quality standard sufficient for their continued eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations, irrespective of any external credit assessment. These positive assessments are the bases for this exceptional and temporary suspension, put in place with a view to contributing to the soundness of financial institutions, thereby strengthening the stability of the financial system as a whole and protecting the customers of those institutions. However, the ECB should closely monitor the continued strong commitment by the Irish Government to fully implement the economic and financial adjustment programme underlying these measures.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Articles 23(4) and 40(1)(g) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In view of the situation on the Community and world sugar markets, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of white sugar until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year which, having regard to possible fluctuations in world prices for sugar, must provide for the determination of export refunds.
(2) The general rules governing invitations to tender for the purpose of determining export refunds for sugar established by Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 should be applied.
(3) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans.
(4) In line with Articles 32 and 33 of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third countries' exports. Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favourable competitive position.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1156/92 (2), and in particular Article 27 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are fixed annually before the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas because of the importance of apple-growing in the Community it is necessary to fix a reference price for apples;
Whereas apples harvested during a given crop year are marketed from July of one year to June of the following year; whereas reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period from 1 July up to and including 30 June of the following year;
Whereas to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas producer prices are the average of the prices recorded during the three years prior to the date of fixing the reference price, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, on the representative market or markets situated in  the production areas where prices are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or for part of it and which satisfy specified requirements as regards market preparation;  whereas when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market must be disregarded;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Europe Agreements between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one  part, and the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland, the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic,  Romania and the Republic of Bulgaria, respectively, of the other part (1), provide for concessions  for certain agricultural products originating in those countries; whereas those concessions involve  reductions in the variable levies under tariff quotas and reductions in customs duties;
Whereas, pursuant to the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the Uruguay Round Multilateral  Trade Negotiations (2), the Community undertook to turn all variable agricultural levies and other  non-tariff barriers into their tariff equivalent and to replace them by fixed customs duties from 1  July 1995;
Whereas the replacement of variable levels and other barriers by customs duties affects the  concessions granted pursuant to the aforementioned Europe Agreements and could reduce the  possibilities for preferential access to the Community market granted to the associated countries  of Central Europe;
Whereas, as a result of the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in accordance with  Articles 76, 102 and 128 of the Act of Accession, those concessions should be adjusted to take into  account also, in particular, the arrangements for trade in agricultural products which existed  between Austria, Finland and Sweden, of the one part, and Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech  Republic, Romania and Bulgaria, of the other part;
Whereas, to that end, transitional autonomous measures are provided for in Regulations (EC) Nos  3379/94 (3), 1767/95 (4) and 2179/95 (5); whereas these measures apply until 31 December 1995;
Whereas, in accordance with the Directives concerning agricultural products adopted by the Council  on 6 March 1995, negotiations are currently under way with the countries concerned for the  conclusion of Additional Protocols to the Europe Agreements; whereas 'interim' Additional Protocols  will cover solely the trade-related aspects of the Additional Protocols; whereas, because of the  excessively tight deadlines, however, the interim Additional Protocols cannot enter into force on 1  January 1996;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 247/2006 of 30 January 2006 laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions of the Union (1), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In the light of the experience gained from the application of Commission Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 (2) it appears that some provisions of that Regulation need to be adapted.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3) provides for the issuing and use of certificates using computerised systems; references to this possibility should be integrated in Regulation (EC) No 793/2006.
(3) The first indent of Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 includes only the specific supply arrangements which are to be paid at any time of the year. Additional measures should be added in order to ensure the proper functioning and the efficiency of the programme. It should therefore be made possible to make payments at any time of the year for import and supply of live animals as well as for the measures referred to in Article 50 of that Regulation.
(4) The procedures for amendments to programmes provided for in Article 49 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 need to be more precise. It is appropriate to specify the rules for the submission of the requests for amendments to the overall programmes and for their approval by the Commission, as well as the timing for their application. Due to budgetary rules, the approved amendments should be implemented as from 1 January of the year following the request for amendment. Moreover, there should be a distinction between major amendments requiring approval by a Commission Decision and minor amendments that should only be notified to the Commission for information.
(5) The current wording of Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 needs to be clarified in a more precise way with reference to the relating Article of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.
(6) In order to ensure a smooth transition from the previous arrangements applying until 2006 as regards the possibility to make use of electronic certificates for the purposes of aid under the Specific Supply Arrangements and as regards the possibility to make payments throughout the year for the import and supply of live animals as well as for the measures referred to in Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 793/2006, the amendments to Articles 5(2), 7(2) and 29 should be applicable as from the date on which the Commission has notified its approval of the relevant Member State's overall programme in accordance with Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 247/2006.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 793/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the application lodged by the Hellenic Republic,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Directive 70/457/EEC, Member States shall ensure that, after the expiry of a period ending on 31 December of the second year following that in which a variety was accepted, seed and propagating material of varieties accepted after 1 July 1972 in one or more Member States in accordance with the provisions of the Directive are subject to no marketing restrictions relating to the variety;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 75/268/EEC of 28 April 1975 on mountain and hill farming and farming in certain less-favoured areas (1), as amended by Directive 76/400/EEC (2), and in particular Article 2 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (4),
Whereas the Government of the French Republic has communicated to the Commission, in accordance with Article 2 (1) of Directive 75/268/EEC, a list of areas situated in the overseas departments of Martinique, Guadeloupe, Reunion and Guyana and eligible for inclusion in the Community list of less-favoured farming areas, together with the relevant information concerning the characteristics of these areas;
Whereas the index used for defining the very difficult climatic conditions referred to in the first indent of Article 3 (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC is for each commune an average altitude of more than 800 metres;
Whereas the index used for defining steep slopes as referred to in the second indent of Article 3 (3) of Directive 75/268/EEC is a percentage greater than 20;
Whereas where there is a combination of the two abovementioned factors, the criteria used are a minimum altitude of 500 metres and an average slope of 15 %, or a minimum altitude of 400 metres and an average slope of 16 %;
Whereas the indices used to define the presence of infertile land referred to in Article 3 (4) (a) of Directive 75/268/EEC are a value of final agricultural production per hectare not exceeding 77 % of the average of Metropolitan France (FF 1 840 and FF 2 400 respectively), or a livestock density of 0.17 livestock units (L.U.) per forage hectare;
Whereas the index used to establish the existence, referred to in Article 3 (4) (b) of Directive 75/268/EEC, of economic results appreciably lower than the mean, is the fact that the gross farm income per family worker amounts to approximately 27 % of the national average of Metropolitan France (FF 7 700 and FF 28 400 respectively);
Whereas the index used to define a low population as referred to in Article 3 (4) (c) of Directive 75/268/EEC is the fact that the actual density is not greater than one inhabitant per square kilometre ; whereas the percentage of the total active population engaged in agriculture is at least 30 %;
Whereas the characteristics used for defining the areas affected by specific handicaps within the meaning of Article 3 (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC are, on the one hand, the unfavourable aspects of natural conditions of production - climatic phenomena of an adverse nature and of frequent occurrence such as cyclones, prolonged periods of drought and of very irregular rainfall, and often very rugged land surfaces - and, on the other hand, handicaps resulting from insularity and remoteness from the mother country ; whereas these characteristics give rise to an increase in the cost of products, especially production materials ; whereas moreover the overall extent of  (1)OJ No L 128, 19.5.1975, p. 1. (2)OJ No L 108, 26.4.1976, p. 21. (3)OJ No C 79, 5.4.1976, p. 37. (4)OJ No C 131, 12.6.1976, p. 28.
these areas does not exceed 2.5 % of the area of the Member States concerned (0.46 % of the combined area of Metropolitan France and the overseas departments);
Whereas the indices thus used by the Government of the French Republic to define the three classes of area in the overseas departments communicated to the Commission satisfy, respectively, the characteristics of the mountain areas, the less-favoured areas and the areas affected by specific handicaps referred to in Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC;
Whereas the communication of the Member State concerned does not describe the present situation in the areas in question with regard to the infrastructure referred to in Article 3 (2) of Directive 75/268/EEC ; whereas it appears that the infrastructure is inadequate ; whereas moreover the absence of information about current or proposed programmes prevents an assessment of the period within which a definite improvement will occur in this situation ; whereas it nevertheless appears expedient to include the areas in question in the Community list of less-favoured farming areas, on the understanding that the Government of the French Republic will present shortly a detailed communication to the Commission on this subject,","{'title': 'Council Directive 76/631/EEC of 20 July 1976 concerning the Community list of less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Directive 75/268/EEC (France - overseas departments)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe areas situated in the overseas departments of Guadeloupe, Reunion, Martinique and Guyana which are listed in the Annex shall be included in the Community list of less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Article 3 (3), (4) and (5) of Directive 75/268/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Member State concerned shall forward to the Commission by the end of 1976 at the latest, a detailed communication indicating the period within which measures for the substantial improvement of infrastructure will be effective in the areas listed in Annex.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThis Directive is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 July 1976.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.P.L.M.M. van der STEE\n\nANHANG - BILAG - ANNEX - ANNEXE - ALLEGATO - BIJLAGE\n\nZones défavorisées au sens de l'article 3 paragraphe 3 de la directive 75/268/CEE\n\nDépartement de la Guadeloupe\n\nParties de communes : Deshaies, Pointe-Noire, Bouillante, Vieux-Habitants, Baillif, Saint-Claude, Gourbeyre, Vieux-Fort, Trois-Rivières, Capes-terre, Sainte-Anne, Morne-à-l'Eau, Gosier, Abymes.\n\nDépartement de la Martinique\n\nCommunes : Fonds-Saint-Denis, Le Morne-Rouge, Le Morne-Vert.\n\nParties de communes : L'Ajoupa-Bouillon, Basse-Pointe, Bellefontaine, Le Carbet, Case-Pilote, Fort-de-France, Grand-Rivière, Gros-Morne, Le Lorrain, Macouba, Le Marigot, Le Prêcheur, Saint-Joseph, Sainte-Marie, Saint-Pierre, Schoelcher.\n\nDépartement de la Réunion\n\nCommunes : Cilaos, Plaine-des-Palmistes, Salazie.\n\nParties de communes : Les Avirons, Bras-Panon, Entre-Deux, L'Étang-Salé, Petite-Île, La Possession, Saint-André, Saint-Benoît, Saint-Denis, Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis, Saint-Joseph, Sainte-Marie, Saint-Paul, Saint-Philippe, Saint-Pierre, Sainte-Rose, Sainte-Suzanne, Le Tampon, Les Trois Bassins.\n\nZones défavorisées au sens de l'article 3 paragraphe 4 de la directive 75/268/CEE\n\nDépartement de la Guyane\n\nZone des communes côtières entre la côte et la limite de l'ancienne colonie de la Guyane : Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni, Mana, Iracoubo, Sinnamary, Kourou, Macouria-Tonate, Montsinery-Tonnegrande, Cayenne, Matoury, Remire-Montjoly, Roura, Regina, Ouanary, Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapok.\n\nZone de l'intérieur : bande de deux kilomètres de largeur le long des fleuves frontières Maroni, à l'Ouest, et Oyapok, à l'Est : Grand-Santi-Papa-Ichton, Maripasoula (à l'ouest sur le Maroni), Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapok (à l'est sur l'Oyapok).\n\nZones défavorisées au sens de l'article 3 paragraphe 5 de la directive 75/268/CEE\n\nDépartement de la Guadeloupe\n\nGrande-Terre\n\nCommunes : Anse-Bertrand, Port-Louis, Le Moule, Saint-François, Pointe-à-Pitre, Petit-Canal.\n\nParties de communes : Sainte-Anne, Morne-à-l'Eau, Le Gosier, Abymes.\n\nBasse-Terre\n\nCommunes : Baie-Mahault, Lamentin, Petit-Bourg, Sainte-Rose, Basse-Terre, Goyave.\n\nParties de communes : Deshaies, Pointe-Noire, Bouillante, Vieux-Habitants, Baillif, Saint-Claude, Gourbeyre, Vieux-Fort, Trois-Rivières, Capes-terre.\n\nDépendances : Les Saintes : Terre-de-Haut, Terre-de-Bas ;

Whereas in application of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, it is necessary to determine for the pigmeat sector and for the 1992/93 marketing year, on the one hand, the quantities of meat and processed products of the forecast  supply balance for Madeira which benefit from an exemption for the levy on direct imports from third countries or from an aid for deliveries originating from the rest of the Community, and on the other hand, the quantities of pure-bred breeding animals  originating in the Community which benefit from an aid with a view to developing the potential for production in the Azores and Madeira;
Whereas it is appropriate to fix the amount of the aids referred to above for the supply to the archipelagos, on the one hand, in meat and, on the other hand, of breeding animals originating in the rest of the Community; whereas these aids must be fixed  taking into account in particular the costs of supply from the world market, conditions due to the geographical situation of the archipelagos and the basis of the current prices on export to third countries for the animals or products concerned;
Whereas the common detailed implementing rules for the supply regime for the Azores and Madeira for certain agricultural products were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1696/92 (2); whereas it is appropriate to lay down complementary  implementing rules adjusted in the light of current commercial practices in the pigmeat sector in particular regarding the duration of the validity of import certificates and the aid, the amount of the securities ensuring compliance with their  obligations by operators;
Whereas with view to efficiently managing the supply regime, it is necessary to provide for a time limit for the making of requests for certificates and a period of reflection for the delivery of the latter;
Whereas in application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, the supply regime is applicable from 1 July 1992; whereas it is necessary to provide for application of the detailed implementing rules from the same date;

(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1941/2006 of 11 December 2006, fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2007 (2), allocated cod fishing quotas to Poland in the Baltic Sea for 2007.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 804/2007 (3) established that catches for cod in the Eastern Baltic Sea (Subdivisions 25-32, EC Waters) were deemed to have exhausted the quota allocated to Poland for 2007 and therefore prohibited, as from 12 July 2007, fishing for that stock in the Baltic Sea by vessels flying the flag of Poland.
(3) On the basis of information in its possession, the Commission estimated in July 2007 that the catches of cod in the Eastern Baltic Sea (Subdivisions 25-32, EC Waters) by vessels flying the flag of Poland were three times the amounts originally declared by Poland. Moreover, fishing vessels flying the flag of Poland continued fishing for that stock after the prohibition, thereby further overshooting the quota allocated to Poland for 2007.
(4) Following several technical meetings between the Polish authorities and the Commission in order to establish a verified quantity of overshooting, Poland notified an overshooting of the quota by 8 000 tonnes.
(5) Article 23(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2847/1993 provides that the Council is to adopt rules for deducting quantities fished in excess from the annual quotas. Those rules are to be established in accordance with the objective and management strategies of the common fisheries policy (CFP), taking into account, as a matter of priority, the degree of overfishing and the biological status of the resources concerned.
(6) Such rules have been established by Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (4). According to Article 5 of that Regulation the quantities fished in excess of the annual quotas should be deducted from the quota of the same stock in the following year.
(7) The main causes for the overfishing of cod by vessels flying the flag of Poland are a deficient control and enforcement scheme and a fleet for which the potential to catch cod is disproportionate with regard to the fishing opportunities allocated each year to Poland by the Council.
(8) In order to address comprehensively the serious shortcomings in the implementation of the common fisheries policy by Poland, resulting in particular in misreported and undeclared fishing for the cod in the Eastern Baltic Sea, and to avoid a repetition of the overfishing of cod that occurred in 2007, Poland has committed itself to adopt and implement National Action Plans including immediate measures to improve the control and enforcement systems in accordance with Community standards and specific measures to adjust the capacity of the Polish fleets in order to achieve a stable balance between that capacity and the fishing opportunities for cod in the Baltic Sea allocated to Poland.
(9) In light of this commitment and given the high amount of overfishing and the resulting socio-economic consequences of its immediate pay-back, it is appropriate to derogate from Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96 and to adopt specific rules for the deduction of the quantities fished in excess.
(10) The quantity of cod fished in excess by Poland in 2007 should therefore be deducted from Poland's quota over a period of four years, in such a way as to reduce the socio-economic consequences in particular in the first year.
(11) The Commission should evaluate the implementation of the National Action Plans adopted by Poland. If the actions and timelines laid down in the plans are not met, the Council may amend the rules for the deduction of the quantities fished in excess.
(12) In order to ensure certainty for the fishers concerned as regards the size of their cod fishing quotas for 2008 in the Baltic Sea and in order to avoid endangering resources, it is essential to decide any reduction in such quotas for 2008 as early as possible in the fishing season.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 18 May 1979  concerning the ""special financing scheme for investments to increase exporting firms' production capacity"" in France  (Only the French text is authentic)  (79/519/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to those concerned to submit their observations,
Whereas:    I. Under the ""special financing scheme for investments to increase exporting firms' production capacity"" in France, ""specialized financial institutions"" float loans on foreign financial markets denominated in foreign currencies with an exchange rate guarantee provided by the State ; the interest rate on the loans is lower than that which could be obtained for loans in French francs on the domestic market.
The funds obtained in this way are on-lent to French firms in the form of long-term loans (up to 15 years) denominated in French francs at a rate of interest approximately two points lower than the terms given by institutions for their own normal loan business. The loans may cover up to 35 % of investment costs intended to increase production capacity. The firms concerned must undertake to increase the proportion of their sales accounted for by their exports to non-member countries.
This favourable rate of interest can be charged by the financial institutions in question only because of the State guarantee against the exchange risks they run when converting funds raised in foreign currencies into loans in French francs. Without the guarantee they would either have to rule out the conversion operation or cover themselves against the risk by charging firms interest rates or a premium which would bring the cost of the loans up to ordinary French commercial rates.
II. By so doing the French authorities ""favour"" certain firms whose investments, thanks to the exchange rate guarantee, have the advantage of a preferential rate of interest. Without running any exchange rate risk at all, since their loans are expressed in French francs, these firms in practice receive an interest relief-grant of some two percentage points.
The provision of a State guarantee of whatever type constitutes an aid, whether or not the State concerned later has to make good a loss. In any event, in the present case the guarantee has resulted in the effective utilization of ""State resources"", as the State budget expended some FF 20 million in 1976 on this head and some FF 40 million in 1977.
The scheme favours ""certain undertakings and the production of certain goods"" since it applies only to investments that expand production capacity in firms undertaking to increase their sales on non-member country markets, even if the production realized as a result of the investment is not used for the purpose of such sales.
Such an aid scheme is likely to affect trade between Member States and to threaten to distort competition.
This conclusion is not invalidated by the argument that the loans are granted at a higher rate of interest than is charged on the financial markets of other Member States.
The fact that a national measure offsets certain disparities between the costs of firms in one Member State and the costs of firms in another does not deprive it of its character of an aid measure. The Court of Justice's judgments on this question were particularly clear in joined cases 6 and 11/69 and case 173/73, where the French and Italian Governments had adduced differences between Member States, concerning rates of interest in one case and the cost of certain social security charges in the other, as grounds for their aids.
III. The scheme constitutes a general scheme of aid, since it is not intended to solve any specific industrial or regional problems defined in advance but may be applied to investment by any firm provided this is linked to increasing its sales in non-member countries.
By reason of the scope of its application the scheme does not, therefore, satisfy the tests for the derogations of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) as aid to facilitate the development of ""certain economic activities or of certain economic areas"", since its benefit may be enjoyed by industrial investment regardless of location and regardless of line of business.
In view of this extensive scope the Commission cannot assess the effects of the scheme of aid on trade and competition within the Community or check for compliance with the principles and disciplines laid down for sectoral and regional aids.
Where a Member State plans to institute sectoral or regional aids it must comply with the requirements and procedures of Article 93 (2) and (3) of the Treaty ; whereas, under the present scheme of general aids, the French Government can at any time take equivalent measures without complying with the said requirements and procedures.
On its current terms the scheme cannot therefore be considered compatible with the common market.
IV. Most of the Member States feel the need for general schemes of aid enabling them to facilitate the adjustment or development of industry in the new context of international competition without being tied in advance to specific sectoral or regional constraints.
In the past the Commission has considered that it could take account of this need while nevertheless ensuring compliance with Community requirements as regards aids, if, before aids were granted under such a scheme, it was in a position to verify that its application satisfied the tests of the Treaty for use of the derogation from the principle of incompatibility with the common market offered by Article 92 (3) (c) and if they satisfy its general policy on use of this derogation.
To this end the Commission, as regards the ""special financing scheme for investements to increase exporting firms' production capacity"", must be given advance notice, pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, as is the case for other general schemes of aid existing in the Community, of:  - any sectoral programmes drawn up by the French Government for the application of this scheme,
or, in their absence,
- individual decisions to grant aid to individual firms where there are likely to be significant effects on trade and competition within the Community.
This procedure extends only to investments in products not listed in Annex II to the Treaty, aids in respect of Annex II products being subject to the rules of the common agricultural policy,","{'title': ""79/519/EEC: Commission Decision of 18 May 1979 concerning the 'special financing scheme for investments to increase exporting firms' production capacity' in France (Only the French text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Government of the French Republic shall take the necessary measures to ensure that loans given by specialized financial institutions under the ""special financing scheme for investment by exporting firms"" are henceforth granted only where the following conditions are fulfilled:    - where such loans are granted under programmes for an entire sector or branch of industry, such programmes shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty,\n\n- where such loans are granted to one or more individual firms, significant cases as defined in Article 2 shall be notified to the Commission in like manner.\n\nThis procedure does not extend to investments in respect of products listed in Annex II to the EEC Treaty.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nGiven the current terms as to interest and duration of the loans in question, significant cases of application shall mean, for the purpose of the first indent of Article 1, cases where the amount of the investment is equal to or greater than three million EUA.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic, which within one month from its date of adoption shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to comply therewith.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 May 1979.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nRaymond VOUEL\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

approving tebuconazole as an existing active substance for use in biocidal products for product-types 7 and 10

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes tebuconazole.
(2) Tebuconazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 7, film preservatives, and product-type 10, masonry preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which correspond respectively to product-types 7 and 10 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Denmark was designated as rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority reports, together with recommendations, to the Commission on 16 April 2012 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority reports were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 27 September 2013, in two assessment reports.
(5) It appears from those reports that biocidal products used for product-types 7 and 10 and containing tebuconazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) It also appears from the reports that the characteristics of tebuconazole render it very persistent (vP) and toxic (T) in accordance with the criteria laid down in Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). The period of approval should be 10 years in consistency with the current practice under Directive 98/8/EC, since the conditions of Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 are not met. However, for the purpose of authorising products in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, tebuconazole shall be considered as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 10(1)(d) of that Regulation.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to approve tebuconazole for use in biocidal products for product-types 7 and 10.
(8) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '25.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 283/40', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1038/2013\nof 24 October 2013\napproving tebuconazole as an existing active substance for use in biocidal products for product-types 7 and 10\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1182/2007 of 26 September 2007 laying down specific rules as regards the fruit and vegetable sector, amending Directives 2001/112/EC and 2001/113/EC and Regulations (EEC) No 827/68, (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96, (EC) No 2826/2000, (EC) No 1782/2003 and (EC) No 318/2006 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 (1), and in particular Article 42(a), (b) and (j) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The first subparagraph of Article 80(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 (2) provides for a limit on market withdrawals as a proportion of the volume of marketed production of any given product in any given producer organisation. In the interests of promoting free distribution as a destination for such withdrawals, that limit should not include products sent for free distribution.
(2) The third subparagraph of Article 80(2) provides for a 3 % margin of error in calculating the volume of marketed production. This terminology might be seen as misleading and in the interests of clarity the provision should instead refer to a 3 % margin of overrun.
(3) Article 55(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1182/2007 provides that operational programmes approved before 31 December 2007 may be modified to meet the requirements of that Regulation. However, such modifications require the Member State concerned to adopt a national strategy under that Regulation, which may take some time in 2008.
(4) Market withdrawals under Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 (3) may not be carried out after 31 December 2007, following the modifications made to that Regulation by Regulation (EC) No 1182/2007.
(5) It is also desirable to allow for the rapid introduction in 2008 of the new crisis prevention and management measures where this is administratively practicable and for which appropriate checks may be carried out, namely those on promotion and communication and training.
(6) Therefore, in order to allow for a smooth transition between the regimes governed by Regulations (EC) No 2200/96 and (EC) No 1182/2007, for rapid implementation of those new crisis prevention and management measures, and to avoid any unnecessary interruption of market withdrawal measures, it is necessary to permit Member States to make expenditure on such measures carried out from 1 January 2008 eligible, even where an operation under a measure is carried out before the operational programme concerned has been amended to cover it. For similar reasons Member States should be permitted to allow amendments to measures in existing programmes under Article 55(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1182/2007 to cover expenditure carried out from 1 January 2008.
(7) In the interests of good management the operation should otherwise respect the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 and the national strategy and operational programme should be subsequently amended to cover that measure before an application is made for payment of the related aid.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Articles 13(2) and 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For tembotrione the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2006/586/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, Austria received on 25 November 2005 an application from Bayer CropScience AG for the inclusion of the active substance tembotrione in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2006/586/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 7 February 2007. In accordance with Article 11(6) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 (4) additional information was requested from the applicant on 14 May 2012. The evaluation of the additional data by Austria was submitted in the format of an updated draft assessment report in September 2012.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance tembotrione (5) on 6 March 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 3 October 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for tembotrione.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing tembotrione may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve tembotrione.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing tembotrione. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(8) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (6) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (7) should be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) established a European Maritime Safety Agency (‘the Agency’) for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 724/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), which amended Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks in the fields of prevention and response to pollution caused by ships, following accidents in Union waters, particularly those of the oil tankers ‘Erika’ and ‘Prestige’.
(3) Regulation (EU) No 100/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5), amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks with regard to response to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations and extended the Agency’s services to the States applying for accession to the Union and to the European Neighbourhood partner countries.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 2038/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) established a multiannual funding for the action of the Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships which expired on 31 December 2013.
(5) Given the potentially devastating ecological impact and extremely high economic costs of pollution incidents, as well as the possible socioeconomic impact of such incidents on other sectors, such as tourism and fisheries, the Agency should have sufficient means to allow it to carry out its assigned tasks in relation to response to marine pollution by ships and oil and gas installations. Those tasks are important in preventing further damage of both a monetary and non-monetary nature.
(6) For the purposes of implementing the tasks of preventing and responding to pollution by ships, the Administrative Board of the Agency adopted on 22 October 2004 an Action Plan for Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response, which determines the Agency’s oil pollution response activities and which is aimed at the optimum use of the financial resources available to the Agency. On 12 June 2007, the Administrative Board adopted an Action Plan for Hazardous and Noxious Substances Pollution Preparedness and Response. In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002, both Action Plans are updated yearly through the Agency’s annual work programme.
(7) Regard should be had to the existing agreements on accidental pollution, which facilitate mutual assistance and cooperation between Member States in this field, as well as to the relevant international conventions and agreements for the protection of European maritime areas from pollution incidents requiring parties to take all appropriate measures to prepare for and respond to an oil pollution incident.
(8) The pollution response action of the Agency, as specified in its action plans, relates to activities in the fields of information, cooperation and coordination, including with regard to marine pollution caused by hazardous and noxious substances. Above all, that response action relates to the provision of operational assistance to the affected Member States or third countries sharing a regional sea basin with the Union (‘affected States’) by supplying, on request, additional anti-pollution vessels to combat oil pollution caused by ships as well as marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations. The Agency should pay particular attention to those areas identified as most vulnerable without prejudice to any other area in need.
(9) The activities of the Agency in the field of pollution response should comply with existing cooperation arrangements providing for mutual assistance in the event of a maritime pollution incident. The Union has acceded to various regional organisations and is preparing to accede to other regional organisations.
(10) The Agency’s action should be coordinated with the activities under the bilateral and regional agreements to which the Union is a party. In the event of a maritime pollution incident, the Agency should assist affected States, under whose authority clean-up operations are conducted.
(11) The Agency should play an active role in maintaining and further developing the European Satellite Oil Monitoring Service (CleanSeaNet) for surveillance, the early detection of pollution and the identification of the ships or oil and gas installations responsible, for example in the case of discharges of oil from ships and of operational releases and accidental spills from offshore platforms. That service should improve the availability of data and the effectiveness and timeliness of the pollution response.
(12) The additional means to be provided by the Agency to affected States should be made available through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism established by Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).
(13) The information related to public and private pollution response mechanisms and associated response capabilities in the various regions of the Union should be made available by Member States through the Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS) established by Council Decision 2007/779/EC, Euratom (8), when available for that purpose.
(14) In order to make the Agency’s operational assistance more efficient in view of the extension of the Agency’s pollution response mandate to third countries sharing a regional sea basin with the Union, the Agency should make every effort to encourage those third countries to pool information and cooperate in the maintenance by the Agency of a list of response mechanisms and associated response capabilities.
(15) In order to improve the effectiveness of the Agency’s pollution response activities, Member States should share with the Agency scientific studies they may have carried out on the effects of chemicals used as dispersants which could be relevant for those activities.
(16) In order to ensure thorough implementation of the Agency’s action plans, the Agency should be provided with a viable and cost-effective system for financing, in particular, the provision of operational assistance to affected States.
(17) Financial security should therefore be provided for the funding of the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of pollution response and associated actions on the basis of a multiannual commitment. The size of that multiannual commitment should reflect the expansion of the Agency’s remit with regard to pollution response, and also the need for the Agency to increase the efficiency in using the funds allocated to it, in a context of budgetary constraints. The annual amounts of the Union contribution should be determined by the European Parliament and the Council in accordance with the annual budgetary procedure. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out a mid-term evaluation of the Agency’s ability to fulfil its responsibilities in the field of response to marine pollution caused by ships and oil and gas installations in an effective and cost-efficient manner.
(18) The amounts to be committed for the funding of pollution response should cover the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020, in line with the multiannual financial framework laid down in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (9) (‘the multiannual financial framework’). A financial envelope covering the same period should therefore be provided.
(19) The Agency’s support to States applying for accession to the Union and to the European Neighbourhood partner countries should be financed through existing Union programmes for those States and countries and should therefore not be part of the multiannual funding of the Agency.
(20) In order to optimise the allocation of commitments and take into account any changes with regard to activities in response to pollution caused by ships, it is necessary to ensure continuous monitoring of the particular needs for action so as to allow for adaptation of the annual financial commitments.
(21) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002, the Agency should report on the financial execution of the multiannual funding of the Agency in its annual report.
(22) It is appropriate to ensure continuity in the funding support provided under the action of the Agency in the field of response to marine pollution caused by ships and oil and gas installations, and to align the period of application of this Regulation with that of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013. Therefore, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2014,","{'header': '28.8.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 257/115', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 911/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23 July 2014\non multiannual funding for the action of the European Maritime Safety Agency in the field of response to marine pollution caused by ships and oil and gas installations\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No\xa01406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)established a European Maritime Safety Agency (‘the Agency’) for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No\xa0724/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), which amended Regulation (EC) No\xa01406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks in the fields of prevention and response to pollution caused by ships, following accidents in Union waters, particularly those of the oil tankers ‘Erika’ and ‘Prestige’.\n\n((3)) Regulation (EU) No\xa0100/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), amending Regulation (EC) No\xa01406/2002, assigned to the Agency tasks with regard to response to marine pollution caused by oil and gas installations and extended the Agency’s services to the States applying for accession to the Union and to the European Neighbourhood partner countries.\n\n((4)) Regulation (EC) No\xa02038/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)established a multiannual funding for the action of the Agency in the field of response to pollution caused by ships which expired on 31 December 2013.\n\n((5)) Given the potentially devastating ecological impact and extremely high economic costs of pollution incidents, as well as the possible socioeconomic impact of such incidents on other sectors, such as tourism and fisheries, the Agency should have sufficient means to allow it to carry out its assigned tasks in relation to response to marine pollution by ships and oil and gas installations.

Whereas the exporting non-member countries have undertaken to issue certificates of authenticity guaranteeing the origin of these products; whereas the form and layout of these certificates and the procedures for using them must be specified; whereas  the certificate of authenticity must be issued by an appropriate authority in a non-member country, the standing of which is such as to ensure that the special arrangements are properly applied;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1084/94 (3), a licence is required for all imports into the Community of beef and veal products;
Whereas in order to ensure that the importing of these meats is managed efficiently it is appropriate to provide that the issuing of import licences shall be subject to verification in particular of the entries on the certificates of authenticity;

Whereas:
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in the Republic of Mozambique to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The requirements in the legislation of Mozambique on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular, the ""Departamento de Inspecção de Pescado (DIP) - Ministério das Pescas"" is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from Mozambique. In particular those rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with article 3(1) (a) (I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3). These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the DIP to the Commission. It is therefore the responsibility of the DIP to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of Directive 91/493/EEC.
(7) The DIP has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the rules set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC with regard to the control of fishery products, and regarding the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 97/132/EC of 17 December 1996 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products(1), as last amended by Decision 2002/957/EC(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex V to the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (""the Agreement"") recognises the sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand. Depending on the equivalence or non-equivalence of these measures with those required by the European Community, Annex VII of the Agreement provides that appropriate official health certificates should be used in the trade of these products with New Zealand.
(2) Commission Decision 2003/56/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2003/385/EC(4), lays down the certification requirements and provides models for official health certificates to be used for the importation from New Zealand of live animals and animal products. In cases where full equivalence of sanitary measures has been determined, simplified certificates may be used, models for which are set out in Annexes II to V to that Decision.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 650/2003(6), provides for special certification requirements for animals and products of animal origin to prevent the spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.

Whereas, because of the outbreak of classical swine fever in certain production regions in Spain, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 913/97 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1147/98 (4), to introduce exceptional support measures for the pigmeat market in that Member State;
Whereas the swift and effective implementation of the exceptional support measures has come up against problems of capacity in the rendering plants which are to process the piglets; whereas, therefore, their slaughter and storage in cold stores should be allowed;
Whereas, because the veterinary and trade restrictions continue to apply, the number of pigs for fattening and piglets which may be delivered to the competent authorities should be increased so that the exceptional measures can continue in the coming weeks and the list of eligible areas laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 913/97 should be adjusted in line with the current veterinary and health situation;
Whereas the discontinuation of the support measures as a result of the number of eligible piglets being used up has led to a substantial increase in the weight of the animals and, consequently, an intolerable situation as regards their welfare; whereas an increase in the number of eligible animals from 12 June 1998 is therefore warranted;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), and in particular Article 18 (1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (2), and in particular Article 22 (1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live birds other than poultry.
(2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in imported birds in quarantine in a Member State, it appears therefore appropriate to suspend imports of these birds from certain areas at risk and to use for the definition of the areas a reference to the relevant Regional Commissions of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
(3) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (1) to Directive 90/425/EEC (3) provides for approved bodies, institutes and centres and a model certificate to accompany animals or their gametes between such approved premises in different Member States. The information required for trade could be used for import purposes.
(4) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC of 16 October 2000 laying down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certification for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine (4) provides that Member States are to authorise the import of birds from the third countries listed as members of the OIE. The countries belonging to the OIE Regional Commissions listed in the Annex to the present Decision are members of the OIE and accordingly Member States are required to accept imports of birds, other than poultry, from those countries under Decision 2000/666/EC.
(5) When admitting to the quarantine premises, the Member States should ascertain, based on certification, whether the particular bird in question is indigenous, or was born and reared or caught in the exporting country.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '28.10.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 285/60', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 27 October 2005\nconcerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries for the import of captive birds\n(notified under document number C(2005) 4288)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/760/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 (2) lays down detailed rules concerning the procedure for recognition of third countries for the purpose of equivalence in accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.
(2) The Council of the European Union, in its conclusions on organic farming of the 3237th Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting of 13 and 14 May 2013, encouraged the Commission to improve the current mechanisms to facilitate international trade in organic products and require reciprocity and transparency in any trade agreement.
(3) The ongoing review of the legal framework of the organic production sector has revealed shortcomings in the current scheme of recognition of third countries for the purpose of equivalence. Most of the equivalence arrangements signed by the Commission and third countries have been unilaterally applied by the European Commission which has not been conducive to the promotion of a level playing field. It was found that equivalence recognition with third countries should be established through international agreements. Therefore, the current scheme of recognition of third countries for the purpose of equivalence based on equivalence arrangements should shift to a scheme based on balanced international agreements with a view to promoting a level playing field, transparency and legal certainty.
(4) In order to facilitate the transition to the new scheme of recognition based on international agreements, it is appropriate to introduce a final date for receiving new requests for inclusion in the list provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 and set out in Annex III to that Regulation.

Whereas sound scientific advice is an essential basis for Community rules on consumer health, which concerns matters relating to consumer health in its strictest sense, but also on animal health and welfare, plant health and environmental health;
Whereas scientific advice on matters relating to consumer health must, in the interests of consumers and industry, be based on the principles of excellence, independence and transparency;
Whereas, besides cases in which consultation of the Scientific Committees is mandatory, those Committees may also be consulted on matters of particular relevance to consumer health and food safety;
Whereas, although many of the problems requiring a scientific opinion fall within the field of competence of one of the existing Scientific Committees, it is nonetheless apparent that some problems may involve the competence of several Committees;
Whereas, in order to strengthen their cohesion and at the same time avoid certain overlaps, it is appropriate to redefine the activities of certain Committees;
Whereas by Decision 97/404/EC (1) the Commission established a Scientific Steering Committee to coordinate the work of the Scientific Committees;
Whereas the Commission must be able to obtain sound and timely scientific advice;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 354/79 (3), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession, laid down the general rules for the import of wines, grape juice and grape must;
Whereas some third countries, having established vis-Ă -vis their wine producers an effective inspection system implemented by the bodies or services of those third countries, referred to in Article 50 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, have expressed an interest in the possibility of authorizing the producers themselves to issue certificates and analysis reports provided for in that Article; whereas, with a view to facilitating trade with those third countries, in so far as they have concluded undertakings with the Community which include clauses, concerning closer cooperation on the prevention of fraud and maintain good trade relations with the Community, it is appropriate to authorize those concerned, in a manner similar to that already allowed for wines of Community origin, to consider documents issued by the producers themselves as documents issued by the said bodies or services of the third countries, provided that they provide appropriate assurances and exert proper control over the issue of such documents;
Whereas, in order to test the effectiveness of the new system, it should be stipulated from the outset, that these rules will apply only for a three-year trial period;
Whereas, in view of the need to ensure swift and effective protection of consumers, it is essential to provide for the possibility of temporarily suspending the new arrangements before the end of the test period in the event of a health risk to the consumer or in the event of fraud;
Whereas Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 354/79 sets out the conditions which the analysis reports must meet; whereas with a view to facilitating trade with third countries which can provide sufficient assurances with regard to the production of wine, it is appropriate to stipulate that only certain particulars need be provided with regard to wine originating in those third countries;
Whereas the present wording of Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 354/79 has given rise to difficulties of interpretation with regard to the total quantity exempted from the requirement to present the documents in question; whereas it should therefore be adapted for reasons of clarity;

THE  COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of 22 December 1994 on protection against  dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community  (1), as last amended by  Regulation (EC) No 1251/95  (2), and in particular Article 10 (5) and 14 (5) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
I.  BACKGROUND
(1)  On 19 December 1994, the Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 3119/94  (3),  imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Russia,  Ukraine, Brazil and South Africa.
(2)  On 26 July 1995, the Commission, by Decision 95/418/EC  (4), accepted an undertaking offered  by, inter alia, the South African producer, Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited,  thereby terminating the investigation with regard to this company.
(3)  On 6 October 1995, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2413/95  (5), imposed a definitive  anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Russia, Ukraine, Brazil and  South Africa. That Regulation excludes from the application of the duty imports of  ferro-silico-manganese produced and exported by, inter alia Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation  Limited on the basis of the undertaking accepted by the Commission.
(4)  By correspondence sent to the Commission immediately prior to the adoption of Regulation (EC)  No 2413/95, however, Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited withdrew the undertaking. A  proposal is accordingly being made to the Council to amend Regulation (EC) No 2413/95 by imposing a  definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese produced and exported by this  company.
II.  REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
A.  Grounds for action
(5)  In light of the circumstances  described above, it is considered appropriate that, pending a decision by the Council on the  imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro-silico-manganese produced and  exported by Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited, such imports be made subject to  registration pursuant to Article 10 (5), in conjunction with Article 14 (5), of Regulation (EC) No  3283/94. This will ensure that, should the Council impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on these  imports, the duty can be levied retroactively from the date of entry into force of this Regulation.  The amount of possible future liability cannot, however, be estimated at this stage of the  procedure.
B.  Imports subject to registration
(6)  The imports subject to registration are imports of  ferro-silico-manganese, falling within CN Code 7202  30  00, originating in South Africa, produced  and exported by Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation Limited (Taric additional code 8874),","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2698/95 of 22 November 1995 introducing registration with regard to certain imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in South Africa', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nImports of ferro-silico-manganese falling within CN code 7202  30   00, originating in South Africa, produced and exported by Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corporation  Limited (Taric additional code 8874) are hereby subject to registration in conformity with Article  14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 3283/94.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe customs authorities are directed, pursuant to Article 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No  3283/94, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports referred to in Article 1.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the  Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall expire nine months following the date of its entry into force or on the date of entry into  force of a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC) No 2413/95 by imposing a definitive  anti-dumping duty on the imports referred to in Article 1, whichever is the earlier.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 22 November 1995.\n\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President'}]}"

of 28 June 2013
laying down further exceptional measures as regards the release of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose on the Union market at reduced surplus levy during the 2012/13 marketing year
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 64(2) and Article 186, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) During the 2011/12 sugar marketing year, the Union average bulk white sugar ex-factory price reached a level of 175 % of the reference price of EUR 404/tonne and was approximately EUR 275/tonne higher than the world market price. The Union price is now stable at a level of around EUR 700/tonne, which is the highest level reached since the reform of the sugar market organisation and disturbs the optimal fluidity of the sugar supply on the Union market. The expected increase of this already high price level at the beginning of the 2012/13 marketing year substantiated the risk of serious market disturbances which had to be prevented by the necessary measures. On 18 January, 15 February and 22 March 2013 the Commission adopted Implementing Regulations (EU) No 36/2013 (2), (EU) No 131/2013 (3) and (EU) No 281/2013 (4) providing exceptional measures intended to address the market disturbance. Notwithstanding the measures taken, the current prices registered on the market show that it is necessary to adopt further measures to address the persisting market disturbance.
(2) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/13, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 500 000 tonnes than in 2011/12. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.
(3) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 4 600 000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/13 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 1 200 000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.
(4) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/13.
(5) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.
(6) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota (5) has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.
(7) For a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, a reduced surplus levy should be fixed at a level per tonne allowing for a fair treatment of Union sugar producers, ensuring the good functioning of the Union sugar market and helping to reduce the difference between Union and world market sugar prices without creating risks of accumulation of surpluses in the Union market.
(8) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar.
(9) With a view to increasing the supply, sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market with a reduced surplus levy.
(10) The reduced surplus levy should be paid after the application is admitted and before the certificate is issued.
(11) The validity of the certificates should be limited in time to encourage a fast improvement of the supply situation.
(12) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant’s own production should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.
(13) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply. The minimum eligibility requirements for applications should be specified.
(14) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received. In order to simplify and standardise those notifications, models should be made available.
(15) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.
(16) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether the quantity applied for was fully or partially granted.
(17) The competent authorities should notify the Commission of the quantities for which certificates with a reduction of the surplus levy have been issued. For this purpose, models should be made available by the Commission.
(18) Sugar quantities released on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates issued under this Regulation should be subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne. This consistent approach is aimed at preventing abuse of the mechanism introduced by this Regulation.
(19) For the purpose of establishing average prices for quota and out-of-quota sugar on the Union market in accordance with Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (6), sugar covered by a certificate issued pursuant to this Regulation should be considered as quota sugar.
(20) In accordance with Article 2(1)(a) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (7) contributions and other duties provided for within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are to constitute own resources. It is therefore necessary to set the date of establishment of the amounts in question within the meaning of Article 2(2) and Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the Communities’ own resources (8).
(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '29.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 179/55', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 629/2013\nof 28 June 2013\nlaying down further exceptional measures as regards the release of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose on the Union market at reduced surplus levy during the 2012/13 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) During the 2011/12 sugar marketing year, the Union average bulk white sugar ex-factory price reached a level of 175\xa0% of the reference price of EUR 404/tonne and was approximately EUR 275/tonne higher than the world market price.

On 18 January, 15 February and 22 March 2013 the Commission adopted Implementing Regulations (EU) No 36/2013(2), (EU) No 131/2013(3)and (EU) No 281/2013(4)providing exceptional measures intended to address the market disturbance. Notwithstanding the measures taken, the current prices registered on the market show that it is necessary to adopt further measures to address the persisting market disturbance.\n\n((2)) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/13, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 500\xa0000 tonnes than in 2011/12. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.\n\n((3)) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 4\xa0600\xa0000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/13 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 1\xa0200\xa0000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.\n\n((4)) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/13.\n\n((5)) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.\n\n((6)) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota(5)has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.\n\n((7)) For a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, a reduced surplus levy should be fixed at a level per tonne allowing for a fair treatment of Union sugar producers, ensuring the good functioning of the Union sugar market and helping to reduce the difference between Union and world market sugar prices without creating risks of accumulation of surpluses in the Union market.\n\n((8)) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar.\n\n((9)) With a view to increasing the supply, sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market with a reduced surplus levy.\n\n((10)) The reduced surplus levy should be paid after the application is admitted and before the certificate is issued.\n\n((11)) The validity of the certificates should be limited in time to encourage a fast improvement of the supply situation.\n\n((12)) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant’s own production should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.\n\n((13)) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply. The minimum eligibility requirements for applications should be specified.\n\n((14)) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received. In order to simplify and standardise those notifications, models should be made available.\n\n((15)) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.\n\n((16)) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether the quantity applied for was fully or partially granted.\n\n((17)) The competent authorities should notify the Commission of the quantities for which certificates with a reduction of the surplus levy have been issued. For this purpose, models should be made available by the Commission.\n\n((18)) Sugar quantities released on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates issued under this Regulation should be subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne. This consistent approach is aimed at preventing abuse of the mechanism introduced by this Regulation.\n\n((19)) For the purpose of establishing average prices for quota and out-of-quota sugar on the Union market in accordance with Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system(6), sugar covered by a certificate issued pursuant to this Regulation should be considered as quota sugar.\n\n((20)) In accordance with Article 2(1)(a) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources(7)contributions and other duties provided for within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are to constitute own resources. It is therefore necessary to set the date of establishment of the amounts in question within the meaning of Article 2(2) and Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the Communities’ own resources(8).\n\n((21)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Temporary reduction of the surplus levy', 'text': 'Article 1\nTemporary reduction of the surplus levy\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 967/2006, the amount of the surplus levy for a maximum quantity of 150\xa0000 tonnes of sugar in white sugar equivalent and 8\xa0000 tonnes of isoglucose in dry matter, produced in excess of the quota fixed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and released on the Union market in the 2012/13 marketing year, shall be fixed at EUR 148 per tonne.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The reduced surplus levy provided for in paragraph 1 shall be paid after the application referred to in Article 2 is admitted and before the certificate referred to in Article 6 is issued.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Application for certificates', 'text': 'Article 2\nApplication for certificates\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0In order to benefit from the conditions specified in Article 1, sugar and isoglucose producers shall apply for a certificate.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Applicants may be only undertakings producing beet and cane sugar or isoglucose, which are approved in accordance with Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and have been allocated a production quota for the 2012/13 marketing year, in accordance with Article 56 of that Regulation.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Each applicant may submit not more than one application for sugar and one for isoglucose per application period.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Applications for certificates shall be submitted by fax or electronic mail to the competent authority in the Member State in which the undertaking was approved.
