THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 435/80 of 18 February 1980 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the overseas countries and territories (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3486/80 (2), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 435/80 stipulates that, for the period 1 January to 31 March, carrots, falling within subheading ex 07.01 G II of the Common Customs Tariff, and, for the period 15 February to 15 May, onions, falling within subheading ex 07.01 H of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States, are subject on importation into the Community to the reduced rates of duty of 10,2 and 4,8 % respectively; whereas such reduction of duties applies only to imports up to ceilings of 500 tonnes for each of these products above which the customs duties actually applicable to third countries are reintroduced; whereas this Regulation comes to an end on 28 February 1985;
Whereas, therefore, the pro rata temporis clause is applicable for the establishment of the levels of the ceilings;
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible reintroduction of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to reintroduce customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2834/84 of 8 October 1984 establishing ceilings and Community surveillance for imports of carrots and onions, falling within heading No ex 07.01 of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (1985)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Articles 30 and 32 thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2008/396/EC (2) cleared, for the 2007 financial year, the accounts of all the paying agencies except for the Estonian paying agency ‘PRIA’, the Greek paying agency ‘OPEKEPE’, the Finnish paying agency ‘MAVI’, the Italian paying agency ‘ARBEA’, the Maltese paying agency ‘MRAE’, the Dutch paying agency ‘Dienst Regelingen’ and the Portuguese paying agencies ‘IFADAP’, ‘INGA’ and ‘IFAP’.
(2) Following the transmission of new information and after additional checks, the Commission can now take a decision on the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted by the Estonian paying agency ‘PRIA’, the Dutch paying agency ‘Dienst Regelingen’ and the Portuguese paying agency ‘INGA’.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD (3) lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting advances paid during the financial year in question, i.e. 2007, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. Such amounts are to be deducted from, or added to, the advances against expenditure from the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken.
(4) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States’ reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model tables 1 and 2 that have to be provided in 2008 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than four or eight years respectively. This Decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
(5) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within four years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within eight years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently to be borne by the Community budget. This Decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation.
(6) In clearing the accounts of the paying agencies concerned, the Commission must take account of the amounts already withheld from the Member States concerned on the basis of Decision 2008/396/EC.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 of 22 May 2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof
Whereas:
(1) The Union has been financing Member States actions in the field of fisheries control and enforcement since 1990, in line with the objectives established in Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (2).
(2) Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 provides, amongst other actions, for Union financial measures for expenditure on fisheries control, inspection and surveillance for the period 2007 to 2013. Commission Regulation (EC) No 391/2007 (3) establishes detailed rules for the implementation of such measures.
(3) Regulation (EU) No 693/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) modified the date by which Member States have to notify their annual fisheries control programme to the Commission.
(4) For simplification purposes and being given the low cost of some investments, it is appropriate to accept projects below EUR 40 000 without requesting justification by Member States.
(5) Rules related to documents supporting pre-financing requests should be aligned with the related provisions set out in Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5)
(6) In view of the principle of sound financial management, Member States should have clear indications on the rules to be followed in order to benefit from Union financial assistance when incurring expenditure in the area of fisheries control and enforcement.
(7) Rules applicable to the Union financial contribution to national control programmes should be simplified and clarified.
(8) Investments in the area of control and enforcement may be carried out by the competent national authorities, by administrative bodies or by the private sector. The statement of expenditure should be adapted in this respect.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 391/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and
Having regard to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of dangerous substances and preparations (1), and in particular Article 2a thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE) is used as a brominated flame retardant in order to protect plastics, fabrics and other articles against fire.
(2) On the basis of a risk assessment pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances (2) it was considered necessary to restrict the placing on the market and use of pentaBDE, and the substance was therefore added to Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC.
(3) Recently, new information has become available showing that pentaBDE is used in specific fabrics for aircraft evacuation slides and slide-rafts and cannot be replaced by suitable alternatives due to the extensive safety testing and regulatory requirements.
(4) Emissions from such slides into the environment and exposure of humans cannot be expected, except in emergency cases for a few seconds, and only in the rare event that the material is burning.
(5) Considering the limited application of pentaBDE in aircraft emergency evacuation systems and the negligible contribution to the overall risks posed by that article to health and the environment, it is justified to permit pentaBDE to be placed on the market and used for that specific purpose.
(6) Given the complexity of the substitution process and the authorisation regulations for aircraft emergency systems, and the serious socio-economic implications, a time limited derogation is justified for articles essential for evacuation situations. Permitting the use of pentaBDE in aircraft emergency evacuation systems would maintain aircraft safety by preventing the use of older emergency systems.
(7) Directive 76/769/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) This Directive should apply without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers, in particular Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (3), and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (Sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (4).

","COMMISSION DECISION of 11 December 1998 under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 concerning section 110(5) of the Copyright Act of the United States of America (notified under document number C(1998) 4033) (98/731/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's right under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 356/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 21 April 1997 the Commission received a complaint pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (hereafter 'the Regulation`). The complaint was lodged by the Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO) with the unanimous support of the Groupement européen des sociétés d'auteurs et compositeurs (GESAC).
(2) The complainant alleged that Section 110(5) of the 1976 Copyright Act of the United States of America is inconsistent with several provisions of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (hereafter 'the WTO Agreement`) and its annexes. On that basis the complainant asked the Commission to take the necessary actions to convince the United States of America to repeal this measure.
(3) The complaint contained sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of a Community examination procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation. Consequently, such procedure was initiated on 11 June 1997 (3).
(4) Following the initiation of the examination procedure the Commission conducted an in-depth legal and factual investigation into Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act as well as into the amendments to the statute as discussed in US Congress at the time of the investigation and enacted meanwhile. Based on the findings of this investigation the Commission reached the conclusions which are indicated below.
B. FINDINGS REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBSTACLE TO TRADE
(5) Although under the US Copyright Act the right holder of a musical work has the exclusive right 'to perform the copyrighted work publicly`, Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act exempts certain public performances from protection. Before the recent addition of a new subparagraph widening the scope of the exemption (see further under item D) it read as follows: 'Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 106, the following are not infringements of copyright: ( . . . ) communication or transmission embodying a performance or display of a work by the public reception of the transmission on a single receiving apparatus of a kind commonly used in private homes, unless (a) a direct charge is made to see or hear the transmission or (b) the transmission thus received is further retransmitted to the public`. The exemption covers the use of a radio or television set 'of a type commonly found in private homes` in a shop, a bar, a restaurant or any other place frequented by the public. As a result of its vague and ambiguous statutory language, Section 110(5) has given rise to a very broad interpretation of what is commonly referred to as the 'homestyle exemption`. For example, it has been held that the exemption can also apply to companies operating large chains of stores throughout the country and using the playing of music in stores as part of their commercial policy (4).
(6) Under Article 9(1) of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (hereafter 'TRIPs`), members must comply with Articles 1 to 21 of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (hereafter the 'Berne Convention`). Article 11bis(1) of the Berne Convention, as revised by the Paris Act of 1971, grants the right holders of literary and artistic works (which include musical works) the exclusive right of authorising not only the broadcasting and other wireless communication of their works, but also the public communication of a broadcast of their works by loudspeaker or analogous instrument. By permitting qualifying locations to use music without being licensed by the right holders and without payment of royalties, the US exemption deprives right holders of the protection to which they are entitled under Article 11bis(1)(iii) when broadcasts of their works are publicly communicated by loudspeakers or analogous instruments and under Article 11(1)(ii) when direct cable transmissions of their works are publicly communicated by such instruments. Article 11bis(1)(iii) or Article 11(1)(ii) clearly cover situations where broadcast music or music transmitted by cable is further transmitted to the public by a radio or a television apparatus (such as under the homestyle exemption) or any other means since it addresses the issue of public communication of broadcast works and not the technical specifications of the means used for that purpose.
(7) Article 11bis(2) of the Berne Convention provides that, while countries may place conditions on the exercise of the exclusive rights set out in Article 11bis(1), such conditions may not be prejudicial to the right holders' right to obtain equitable remuneration. Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act is prejudicial to the right holders' right to obtain such remuneration, as it deprives them of all remuneration in respect of the use of their works in situations covered by the homestyle exemption.
(8) The Commission also reviewed the homestyle exemption from the point of view of 'minor reservations`, a category of exceptions which might be considered to apply on the exercise of the exclusive rights under the Berne Convention, but concluded that, even where 'minor reservations` were applicable to the exclusive rights set out in Article 11bis(1)(iii) and (1)(ii), it would still remain that the homestyle exemption is clearly not a minor reservation. The exemption is widely applied on a commercial basis through the US and the economic losses incurred by Community rightholders are important, ranging between 13 to 24 % of the US performing rights organisations' annual distributions to Community collecting societies representing composers and arrangers of music, lyricists and publishers.
(9) Since Article 9(1) of TRIPs imposes a mandatory obligation on WTO members to comply with Articles 1 to 21 of the Berne Convention, a WTO member is in breach of its obligations under the TRIPs Agreement where it fails to comply with the Berne Convention. Therefore, since Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act contravenes Article 11bis(1), bis (2) and (1) of the Berne Convention, Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act is in breach of Article 9(1) of TRIPs. Also, the Commission holds the opinion that Article 13 of TRIPs cannot be invoked by the United States to justify the homestyle exemption, as this provision limits the scope of existing exemptions under the Berne Convention to special cases which do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. It does not allow additional exemptions to the rights protected under the Berne Convention.
(10) Under these circumstances the Commission considers that the complainant's allegations are well-founded and that Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act constitutes an obstacle to trade within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation, that is 'a practice adopted or maintained by a third country in respect of which international trade rules establish a right of action`.
(11) The Commission none the less considers that reference to the above legal bases does not rule out recourse to any other pertinent provision of the WTO Agreement and of the Agreements annexed to it, which could be of use in procedures before the WTO.
C. FINDINGS REGARDING ADVERSE TRADE EFFECTS
(12) Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act curtails Community right holders in the full and normal exercise of their exclusive rights under the Berne Convention and the TRIPs Agreement. The right holders are deprived of the possibility to license the performing right of their work (either directly or through collecting societies) and of the possibility to obtain remuneration for the communication of their works to the public.
(13) The most direct effect of Section 110(5) is that it deprives right holders of their remuneration for certain communications to the public. Estimations made by the Commission reveal that the direct loss of licensing income to Community right holders for performing rights in music (i.e. composers and arrangers of music, lyricists and music publishers) resulting from the application of Section 110(5) amounts to between USD 3,8 and 6,8 million a year. These amounts represent 13 to 24 % of the US performing rights organisations' annual distributions to Community collecting societies representing these three categories of right holders. This shows that the losses caused by the homestyle exemption to the Community right holders are important.
(14) The homestyle exemption also entails indirect losses to the Community right holders as it acts as a disincentive to the US performing right organisations to effectively and efficiently license bars, shops, restaurants and others in markets where no exemption exists and leads to a reduction of the efficiency of US organisations when trying to license such venues. The result of the very existence of Section 110(5) is that even those venues which clearly do not qualify for the exemption are not always properly licensed.
(15) Further indirect losses are also caused by the fact that the homestyle exemption has acted as a catalyst for negative public and private attitudes towards licensing of non-dramatical musical works in the US. Powerful lobbies of music users have systematically (and successfully) resisted efforts by the collecting societies to effectively license and to collect reasonable fees for the communication of music to the public.
(16) As a result of Section 110(5), the prospective revenue a right holder can expect from the licensing of his work in the US is less than it should be. This reduced prospective income may have a negative impact on the stimulus to export music to the US.
(17) Under these circumstances the Commission considers that the complainant's allegations are well-founded and that Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act is causing adverse trade effects within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the Regulation.
D. RECENT AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 110(5) OF THE US COPYRIGHT ACT
(18) While the Commission was investigating the homestyle exemption, US Congress was examining a bill amending Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act in view of widening its scope.
(19) On 6 and 7 October 1998, the bill, entitled 'Fairness in Music Licensing Act`, was adopted by, respectively, the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. The bill consists of adding a new subparagraph B to Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act which provides for a further exception to the rightholders' exclusive right to authorise public communication of their works, while the homestyle exemption remains unchanged under subparagraph A. The new subparagraph B now applies to a much wider range of beneficiaries, namely eating, drinking and other commercial establishments provided that they fulfil a certain number of conditions, mainly with regard to the surface of the establishment and the number of loudspeakers used. It covers the use of any type of audiovisual device, and is thus not limited to the use of a 'homestyle` apparatus only.
(20) The bill was signed by the President of the United States on 27 October 1998, to enter into force 90 days after enactment. Since this means that, from a legal point of view, the bill is now part of the US legal order, although its entry into effect has been delayed for 90 days, it can already be the object of a dispute settlement procedure under WTO.
(21) From a legal point of view, the new paragraph B of Section 110(5) also deprives right holders to the protection they are entitled under Articles 11bis (1)(iii) and 11(1)(ii) of the Berne Convention when broadcasts of their works or cable transmissions of their works are communicated to the public. Therefore, the Commission's analysis of the 1976 version of Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act (now under subparagraph A of the section) fully applies to the new version of the Statute, which is thus equally in breach of the Berne Convention and the TRIPs Agreement.
(22) As far as the adverse trade effects are concerned, it is clear that they will be seriously amplified by the widening of the Statute's scope in terms of beneficiaries and type of audiovisual devices used to perform music in public establishments. Whereas the Commission estimated that the 1976 homestyle exemption applied to between 20 and 35 % of US business establishments categorised as small business by US Government and employing fewer than 20 persons, and to between 6 and 12 % of US business of the same category employing more than 20 persons, the US collecting societies estimate that, only where eating and drinking business is concerned, the new Bill would already exempt 70 % of all US bars and restaurants, as they fall below the surface thresholds under the new Section 110(5)B.
E. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(23) Ensuring that WTO partners fully comply with their obligations is of the utmost importance for the Community which has committed itself to the same obligations. Therefore, the Community should immediately challenge Section 110(5) of the US Copyright Act.
F. CONCLUSIONS AND MEASURES TO BE TAKEN
(24) Meetings have been held and letters have been exchanged with the relevant US authorities to discuss this matter further and aimed at finding an amicable solution to the problems concerning the licensing of music works but the US authorities have not forwarded any proposals in view of such a solution.
(25) In these circumstances, it appears that the interests of the Community call for initiation of WTO dispute settlement proceedings,","{'title': '98/731/EC: Commission Decision of 11 December 1998 under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 concerning section 110(5) of the Copyright Act of the United States of America (notified under document number C(1998) 4033)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

(1) Fishery resources, which are an exhaustible natural resource, should be protected in the interests of biological balances and global food security.
(2) In 1994 the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the European Community is a contracting party, adopted an action plan to ensure the effectiveness of its conservation programme for Atlantic blue-fin tuna.
(3) The stocks concerned cannot be managed effectively by the ICCAT contracting parties, whose fishermen are obliged to reduce their catches of Atlantic blue-fin tuna, unless all non-contracting parties fishing Atlantic blue-fin tuna cooperate with ICCAT and comply with its conservation and management measures.
(4) ICCAT has identified Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic blue-fin tuna in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of the organisation's tuna conservation measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the observation of vessels.
(5) Imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna originating in Belize, Equatorial Guinea and Honduras are currently prohibited by Council Regulation (EC) No 2092/2000 of 28 September 2000 prohibiting imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) originating in Belize, Honduras and Equatorial Guinea(1).
(6) ICCAT has taken note of the strengthening of cooperation with Honduras for the conservation of Atlantic blue-fin tuna. At its 2001 annual meeting it recommended the lifting of the prohibition of imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Honduras.
(7) ICCAT has taken note of the progress of cooperation with Belize for the conservation of Atlantic blue-fin tuna. At its 2003 annual meeting it recommended the lifting, as of 1 January 2004, of the prohibition of imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Belize.
(8) ICCAT's attempts to encourage Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to comply with measures for the conservation and management of Atlantic blue-fin tuna have been to no avail.
(9) ICCAT has recommended its contracting parties to take appropriate steps to prohibit imports of Atlantic blue-fin tuna products in any form from Sierra Leone and to continue prohibiting such imports from Equatorial Guinea. These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures. These measures should therefore be implemented by the Community, which has sole competence in this matter.
(10) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements.

approving aid from Spain to the coal industry during 1989

(89/102/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1),
Whereas:
I
By letters of 22 September and 13 October 1988, the Spanish Government informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, of the financial measures it intends to take during 1989 in order to give direct of indirect support to the coal industry. The following aid is submitted for the approval of the Commission pursuant to the abovementioned Decision:
1.2 //  // (Pta, million)   // - aid to cover operating losses   // 48 358,9   // - aid to sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry   // 2 585,0   // - aid to promote innovation   // 615,0   // - aid to the mining environment   // 125,0.
Aid totalling Pta 48 358 900 000 to cover operating losses has been granted to the Hunosa, Figaredo, Hullasa and La Camocha undertakings in respect of total production of 4 284 000 tonnes to cover the difference for each tonne produced between projected average costs and projected average revenue. This aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence complies with Article 3 (1) of the Decision.
The aid to cover operating losses is intended to facilitate the process of rationalization in the coal industry by staggering pit closures under a regional industrial conversion policy. It thereby helps solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry in accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.
Pursuant to Article 12 of the Decision, coal undertakings are authorized to grant rebates on their list prices or production costs for deliveries of coking coal, coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces in the Community iron and steel industry under long-term contract. These rebates must not cause the delivered prices of Community coke and coal to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke manufactured from coal from non-member countries.
The aid totalling Pta 2 585 000 000 for supplying coking coal, coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces in the Community iron and steel industry covers the difference between world market prices and production costs for an output of 397 000 tonnes. This aid is hence compatible with Article 4 of the Decision.
The aid for supplying coking coal, coke and coal for injection in blast furnaces in the Community iron and steel industry is intended to facilitate the process of rationalization in the coal industry by staggering pit closures under a regional industrial conversion policy. It thus helps solve the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third indent of Article 2 (1).
The Spanish Government plans to grant aid to promote innovation in the coal industry in 1989. This aid amounting to Pta 615 million, will be divided among the following coal fields: Central Asturiana, Bierzo-Villablino, Narcea, Leรณn-Este, Palencia, Aragรณn, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands.
This aid is intended to ensure that research results find practical applications in production as quickly as possible.
The aid has to be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 9 (2) and Annex 2 (b) of the Decision as 'other' measures. Such measures have to be assessed in accordance with Article 10 (2) of the Decision.
The Commission has made the examination provided for in Article 67 of the ECSC Treaty and has reached the conclusion that the aid to promote innovation does not confer on the Spanish coal industry any particular competitive advantage which is incompatible with the common market.
This measure will help improve the competitiveness of the coal industry, in accordance with the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.
The Spanish Government plans to grant aid of Pta 125 000 000 to improve the environment in the coal industry in 1989. This aid concerns restoration of spoil heaps and water purification. The aid to the mining environment is intended to enhance the quality of the environment in the areas concerned.
This aid has to be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 9 (2) and Annex 2 (b) of the Decision as 'other' measures. Such measures have to be assessed in accordance with Article 10 (2) of the Decision.
The Commission has made the examination provided for in Article 67 of the ECSC Treaty and has reached the conclusion that the aid to the mining environment does not confer on the Spanish coal industry any particular competitive advantage which is incompatible with the common market.
This measure will contribute to the implementation of the environment policy objectives laid down by the Commission of the European Communities.
II
Pursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it approves is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Articles 3 to 6 thereof.

(1) A drafting error slipped in Article 5(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1913/2006 (2) as regards the determination of the operative event for the aid granted for supplying certain milk products provided for in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2707/2000 of 11 December 2000 laying down rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards Community aid for supplying milk and certain milk products to pupils in educational establishments (3).

(2) The wording in Article 11(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1913/2006 appears as redundant with Article 6. For the sake of clarity the words ‘in which the operative event for the exchange rate is 1 October’ should be deleted from that provision.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 91, Article 100(2) and the first subparagraph of Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9), thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 31 May 1995, the Government of the Republic of Seychelles applied for accession to the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), pursuant to Article XII of that Agreement.
(2) A Working Party on the accession of the Republic of Seychelles was established on 11 July 1995 in order to reach agreement on terms of accession acceptable to the Republic of Seychelles and all WTO Members.
(3) The Commission, on behalf of the Union, has negotiated a comprehensive series of market opening commitments on the part of the Republic of Seychelles which satisfy the Union's requests, taking into account the bilateral trade relations with the Republic of Seychelles in the context of the EU-ACP partnership and the undertaking by the Republic of Seychelles to pursue trade liberalisation in a full Economic and Partnership Agreement.
(4) Those commitments are now embodied in the Protocol of Accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the WTO (‘the Protocol of Accession’).
(5) Accession to the WTO is expected to make a positive and lasting contribution to the process of economic reform and sustainable development in the Republic of Seychelles.
(6) The Protocol of Accession should therefore be approved.
(7) Article XII of the Agreement establishing the WTO provides that the terms of accession are to be agreed between the acceding Member and the WTO, and that the Ministerial Conference of the WTO approves the terms of accession on the WTO side. Article IV.2 of the Agreement establishing the WTO provides that in the intervals between meetings of the Ministerial Conference, its functions shall be conducted by the General Council.
(8) Accordingly, it is necessary to establish the position to be adopted on the Union's behalf within the General Council of the WTO on the accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the WTO,","{'header': '10.12.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 353/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 9 December 2014\nestablishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization on the accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the World Trade Organization\n(2014/889/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 31 May 1995, the Government of the Republic of Seychelles applied for accession to the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO), pursuant to Article XII of that Agreement.\n\n((2)) A Working Party on the accession of the Republic of Seychelles was established on 11 July 1995 in order to reach agreement on terms of accession acceptable to the Republic of Seychelles and all WTO Members.\n\n((3)) The Commission, on behalf of the Union, has negotiated a comprehensive series of market opening commitments on the part of the Republic of Seychelles which satisfy the Union's requests, taking into account the bilateral trade relations with the Republic of Seychelles in the context of the EU-ACP partnership and the undertaking by the Republic of Seychelles to pursue trade liberalisation in a full Economic and Partnership Agreement.\n\n((4)) Those commitments are now embodied in the Protocol of Accession of the Republic of Seychelles to the WTO (‘the Protocol of Accession’).\n\n((5)) Accession to the WTO is expected to make a positive and lasting contribution to the process of economic reform and sustainable development in the Republic of Seychelles.\n\n((6)) The Protocol of Accession should therefore be approved.\n\n((7)) Article XII of the Agreement establishing the WTO provides that the terms of accession are to be agreed between the acceding Member and the WTO, and that the Ministerial Conference of the WTO approves the terms of accession on the WTO side.

of 29 April 2004
amending Directive 94/54/EC as regards the labelling of certain foods containing glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Food,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 94/54/EC of 18 November 1994 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other than those provided for in Directive 2000/13/EC (2) contains a list of foodstuffs for which the labelling must include one or more additional particulars.
(2) The purpose of this Directive is to supplement that list with regard to certain foods containing glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt.
(3) Glycyrrhizinic acid naturally occurs in the liquorice plant Glycyrrhiza glabra while its ammonium salt is manufactured from aqueous extracts of liquorice plant Glycyrrhiza glabra. Glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt are included in the Community register of flavouring substances laid down by Commission Decision 1999/217/EC of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996 (3). Exposure to glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt occur mostly via consumption of liquorice confectionery, including chewing gum, herbal teas and other beverages.
(4) The Scientific Committee on Food, in its opinion of 4 April 2003 on glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt, concluded that an upper limit for regular ingestion of 100 mg/day provides a sufficient level of protection for the majority of the population, consumption above this level may give rise to hypertension. However the Committee noted that within the human population there are subgroups for which this upper limit might not offer sufficient protection. These subgroups comprise people with medical conditions related to disturbed water- and electrolyte homeostasis.
(5) These findings make it necessary to provide labelling which gives the consumers clear information on the presence of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in confectionery and beverages. In the case of high contents of glycyrrhizinic acid or its ammonium salt in these products, the consumers, and in particular those suffering from hypertension, should in addition be informed that excessive intake should be avoided.

Whereas:
(1) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. However, in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article, the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However, that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.
(2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector.
(4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2000/29/EC, a financial contribution from the Community may be granted to Member States to cover expenditure relating directly to the necessary measures which have been taken or are planned to be taken for the purpose of combating harmful organisms introduced from third countries or from other areas in the Community, in order to eradicate or, if that is not possible, to contain them.
(2) Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland have each established a programme of actions to eradicate organisms harmful to plants introduced in their territories. These programmes specify the objectives to be achieved, the measures carried out, their duration and their cost. Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland have applied for the allocation of a Community financial contribution to these programmes within the time limit set out in Directive 2000/29/EC and in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1040/2002 of 14 June 2002 establishing detailed rules for the implementation of the provisions relating to the allocation of a financial contribution from the Community for plant-health control and repealing Regulation (EC) No 2051/97 (2).
(3) The technical information provided by Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Finland has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution, as laid down in particular in Article 23 of Directive 2000/29/EC, have been met. Accordingly, it is appropriate to provide a Community financial contribution to cover the expenditure on these programmes.
(4) The Community financial contribution may cover up to 50 % of eligible expenditure. However, in accordance with Article 23(5) third paragraph of the Directive, the rate of the Community financial contribution for the programme presented by Germany and a part of the programme of the Netherlands should be reduced as the programmes notified by these Member States have already been the subject of Community funding respectively under Commission Decision 2006/885/EC (3) for Germany and Decision 2005/789/EC (4) for the Netherlands.
(5) In accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2000/29/EC the Commission shall ascertain whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and adopt the measures required by the findings from its verification.
(6) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 (5) on the financing of the common agricultural policy, plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.

Whereas:

(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2), on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance of raw sugar. For the 2008/2009 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met.
(3) To ensure that refineries within the Community have a sufficient supply of raw sugar to fulfil their traditional supply needs, the complementary quantity should be allocated between the third countries concerned in a way to ensure full delivery. For India, it is considered appropriate to maintain an initial quantity of 10 000 tonnes. As regards the remaining supply need, a global quantity should be fixed for the ACP States, which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(3), and in particular Article 7(4) thereof,
After consulting the Committee for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 stipulate that the Commission is to exclude expenditure from Community financing where it finds that it has not been incurred in accordance with Community rules.
(2) The above Articles of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 as well as Article 8(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 of 7 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of the accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2025/2001(5), provide that the Commission is to carry out the necessary checks, forward its findings to the Member States, consider any comments from the latter, enter into bilateral discussions to reach an agreement with the Member States concerned and formally communicate its conclusions to them, referring to Commission Decision 94/442/EC of 1 July 1994 setting up a conciliation procedure in the context of the clearance of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee Section(6), as last amended by Decision 2001/535/EC(7).
(3) The Member States have had the opportunity to request that a conciliation procedure be initiated. That procedure has been applied in some cases and the reports issued on the outcome have been considered by the Commission.
(4) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 provide that refunds on exports to third countries and intervention intended to stabilise agricultural markets may be financed only where they are either granted or undertaken in accordance with the Community rules governing the common organisations of agricultural markets.
(5) The findings of checks performed, the results of bilateral discussions and the outcome of the conciliation procedures have shown that some expenditure declared by the Member States does not meet those conditions and cannot therefore be financed under the EAGGF Guarantee Section.
(6) The Annex to this Decision sets out the amounts that are not recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Those amounts do not relate to expenditure incurred more than 24 months before the Commission's written notification of the results of the checks to the Member States.
(7) As regards the cases covered by this Decision, the assessment of the amounts to be excluded on grounds of non-compliance with Community rules was notified by the Commission to the Member States and is set out in a summary report on the subject.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Articles 30 and 75 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, according to Articles 30 and 75 of the Act of Accession, the duties applicable on the import into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 of dried figs falling within code ex 0804 20 90 of the combined nomenclature and originating in Spain, within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 200 tonnes shall be progressively abolished; whereas these duties are to be reduced to 62,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1988; whereas, by derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/86 of 24 February 1986 concerning the basic duties to be adopted in the Community of Ten for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal (1) provides that the basic duties are those which were actually applied on 1 January 1986; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the import of these products, a Community tariff quota should be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1988 for 200 tonnes of dried figs originating in Spain and falling within code ex 0804 20 90 of the combined nomenclature at duties as shown in the table in Article 1;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade in agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question, originating in Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quota is applicable only in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;
Whereas from 1 January 1988 the nomenclature used under the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized System of Community Description and Coding system;
Whereas this Regulation should into account this fact by including the combined nomenclture codes as well as well as where appropriate the TARIC codes relevant to the products in question;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, in the present case, it seems advisable not to allocate this quota among the Member States without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volume of such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to the procedure specified in Article 1 (2); whereas this method of management requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is used up and inform the Member States thereof;

(2) Whereas as a result of interceptions of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) on wooden packing material made from hardwood originating in some areas of China, the United Kingdom took official measures on 14 December 1998 in order to protect its territory from the danger of introduction of the said organism and set up additional specific monitoring procedures for the said organism on the said commodity;
(3) Whereas on the basis of information provided by the United Kingdom and international scientific technical literature, Hong Kong is known to be free from Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky);

or
- wood used to wedge or support cargo, including wood which has not kept its natural round surface, originating in China (except Hong Kong),

Whereas these additional amendments will be implemented as soon as possible, and at all events by 30 June 1983, and the procedures shall continue to be applied until such time as designated zones have been established in all of the national territory and the injected herd incidence has reached the level of 0;2 % or less;
Whereas, after examination and taking into account the initial plan, the extended plan was found to comply with Directives 77/391/EEC, 78/52/EEC and 82/400/EEC;
Whereas the extended plan ensures continuity with the measures put in hand under the initial plan; whereas the initial plan expired on 18 September 1981;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2176/2002(2), and in particular Article 9(1)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the Combined Nomenclature, set out in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, certain vegetable-based sauces are to be classified under heading 2103, whereas prepared or preserved vegetables fall within Chapter 20.
(2) To make easier the distinction between products to be classified under heading 2103 and products falling within Chapter 20, Commission Regulation (EC) No 288/97 of 17 February 1997 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff and repealing a number of regulations on classification(3) inserted additional note 1 to Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature. That additional note lays down a distinction criterion based on the passing through a standardised metal wire sieve. The criterion was fixed to a minimum of 80 % by weight of ingredients passing through a metal sieve in order to consider the product as a sauce.
(3) According to the harmonised system explanatory note to heading 2103, part A, the term ""sauces"" also includes certain preparations, based on vegetables or fruit, which are mainly liquids, emulsions or suspensions, and sometimes contain visible pieces of vegetables or fruit. Those preparations differ from prepared or preserved vegetables and fruit of Chapter 20 in that they are used as sauces, i.e. as an accompaniment to food or in the preparation of certain food dishes, but are not intended to be eaten by themselves.
(4) Nowadays a new type of vegetable-based sauce containing visible and identifiable lumps of vegetables or fruit, but where less than 80 % by weight of the ingredients pass through the sieve, is presented and put on the market as a sauce. By virtue of additional note 1 to Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature, that type of sauce cannot be regarded as a sauce of heading 2103, whereas in accordance with the nomenclature of the harmonised system classification as sauce would be possible(4).
(5) Therefore it appears appropriate and necessary to delete additional note 1 to Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature.
(6) It should be noted that it was not possible to reach an agreement to amend the text of heading 2103 in the harmonised system nomenclature as regards classification of sauces or to adapt additional note 1 to Chapter 21 of the Combined Nomenclature which is established on the basis of the harmonised system.
(7) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(c), (d) and (g) of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector (2).
(5) Export refunds may be set to cover the competitive gap between Community and third country's exports.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69 (1) of 25 March 1969 on the harmonization of certain social legislation relating to road transport, as amended by Council Regulations (EEC) Nos 514/72 and 515/72 (2) of 28 February 1972, and in particular Article 14 (1) thereof;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 14 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69 provides that the Commission shall, on the application of a Member State, approve a control book of a model different from the model shown in the Annex, on condition that such model does not differ in essential points from the model laid down by the Community;
Whereas by letter dated 16 October 1972 the German Government applied to the Commission for approval of the individual control book (Livret de travail du conducteur professionnel de vĂŠhicules automobiles) currently in use in Switzerland;
Whereas this control book, however, differs from the Community model in the following respects in particular:    - total weekly driving time is not shown, whereas it is an essential aim of current Community rules that this be shown;
- permissible maximum weight is not shown, whereas on this factor depends the application of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 543/69, relating to double-manning for distance exceeding 450 kilometres;
- as regards the carriage of passengers, no provision is made for a choice of daily rest period arrangements as provided for in Article 11.
Whereas these differences from the Community model concern essential points within the meaning of Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69 of 25 March 1969, as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 514/72 of 28 February 1972 ; whereas the points in question are intended to ensure that certain basic principles of Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69 are observed;
Whereas the fact that vehicles registered in Switzerland are fitted with a tachygraph, thus enabling a check to be kept on total weekly driving time, is not conclusive in this connection, for, besides being outside the requirement prescribed by the provision in question for the approval of control books of a model different from the Community model, it does not in any case remedy the other two deficiencies pointed out above;
Whereas the control book submitted for approval does not therefore enable a proper check to be kept in compliance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69;","{'title': '73/318/EEC: Commission Decision of 4 October 1973 in connection with social legislation relating to road transport refusing approval of the use of the Swiss individual control book', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFollowing the application by the German Government under the second subparagraph of Article 14 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 543/69 of 25 March 1969 on the harmonization of certain social legislation relating to road transport, as amended by Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 514/72 of 28 February 1972, approval for the Swiss control book is refused.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 4 October 1973.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nThe President\n\nFrançois-Xavier ORTOLI  (1)OJ No L 77, 29.3.1969, p. 49.

imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon metal originating in the People's Republic of China
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consultation with the Advisory Committee as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In December 1988 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Liaison Committee of Ferroalloy Industries in the European Economic Community on behalf of producers representing all Community production of silicon metal and concerning imports of that product originating in China and imported from that country or from Hong Kong.
(2) The complaint contained evidence of dumping and consequent material injury which was judged sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. In a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the Commission accordingly announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning silicon metal falling within CN code 2804 69 00.
(3) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned and the complainant and gave the parties concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing.
(4) Only two exporters and a small number of importers made their views known in writing.
(5) Only one processor made comments regarding the possible imposition of an anti-dumping duty.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purposes of making a preliminary determination of dumping and consequent injury. It carried out inspections at the premises of:
(a) all the Community producers:
- PĂŠchiney ElectromĂŠtallurgie, Paris, France,
- VAW - Vereinigte Aluminium-Werke AG, Bonn, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Carburos MetĂĄlicos, Barcelona, Spain,
- Siderleghe Srl, Milan, Italy,
- OET Calusco SpA, Milan, ;
(b) the importer:
- R. Hostombe Ltd, Sheffield, United Kingdom.
(7) The dumping investigation covered the period 1 January to 31 December 1988. The proceeding was extended owing to the difficulty in finding a reference market.
B. THE PRODUCT
(i) Definition
(8) The product is silicon metal produced in an electric arc furnace by reducing silicon quartz with the help of various carbonaceous products.
It is marketed in the form of lumps, grains or powder. There are internationally accepted specifications regarding differences in quality resulting from impurities - iron, aluminium and calcium.
The product covered by this proceeding comes exclusively from China, since silicon metal is not produced in Hong Kong.
(ii) Like product
(9) The same international technical specifications apply both to the imported product referred to in the complaint and to silicon metal produced in the Community. Despite some difference in purity and dimensions between the Chinese product and the Community product, the physical characteristics of the products and their applications are essentially the same. The Community product and the imported product are therefore like products. The parties concerned have not put forward any arguments on this point.
C. NORMAL VALUE
(10) Since China does not have a market economy and since the product in question is not manufactured in Hong Kong, the complainant suggested comparing export prices with prices or costs in a similar country, particularly the United States. However,
the American producers either refused to cooperate with the Commission or failed to provide sufficient information. The Commission therefore contacted producers in three other similar countries, viz. Norway, Canada and Yugoslavia. These producers too either refused to cooperate with the Commission or failed to provide sufficient information. Given these circumstances, the Commission came to the provisional conclusion that it had no choice but to establish the normal value in accordance with Article 2 (5) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, i.e. on the basis of the price payable in the Community for the like product, duly adjusted to include a reasonable profit margin.
D. EXPORT PRICE
(11) Since the Chinese exporters and the importers of the product into the Community failed to provide satisfactory and representative replies, the export price was established provisionally, in accordance with Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 on the basis of the information available, i.e. the import prices published by Eurostat. The Commission found that this information was very similar to the information supplied by the exporters, which had given partial replies to the Commission's questionnaire.
(12) Since the Hong Kong export prices and those in the Eurostat statistics actually refer to the Chinese product, account was taken, when establishing the export price, of quantities and prices of exports from both China and Hong Kong.
E. COMPARISON
(13) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account of differences affecting the comparability of prices, and in particular differences in the physical characteristics of the products and in the costs of transport from China to the Community.
The chief differences in the physical characteristics of the products consisted in the grain sizes of the delivered product, its purity and the lower quality packaging. The adjustment took account of costs incurred by the importer as a result of checks on differences in volume, quality and packaging.
(14) All comparisons were made at the fob stage.
(15) The margin was established by comparing the monthly normal value with the corresponding monthly export prices.
F. DUMPING MARGIN
(16) The preliminary examination of the facts showed that imports were being dumped, the dumping margin being equal to the difference between the established normal value and the export price to the Community.
The weighted average dumping margin for the investigation period was 38,73 %.
(17) Since the Hong Kong export prices actually refer to the Chinese product and since the product concerned is not manufactured in Hong Kong, a separate dumping margin was not calculated for Hong Kong.
G. INJURY
1. Imports and market share
(18) Imports into the Community of the product originating in China began in 1987, totalling 7 876 tonnes that year. During 1988 imports rose to 20 214 tonnes, i.e. an increase of 157 % between 1987 and 1988.
The market share of the import product, measured in relation to total consumption in the Community, rose from 0 % in 1986 to 3,6 % in 1987 and 9,3 % in 1988. The market share of the Community industry fell from 44,7 % in 1986 to 37,10 % in 1987, rising only slightly in 1988 to reach 38 %.
2. Price trends
(19) The weighted average prices of imports originating in China charged to their first independent purchasers in the Community were 5,4 % lower than the prices charged by the Community producers to their first purchasers during the reference period. The price was not sufficient to cover the costs of the Community producers.
The comparison takes into account the differences in the physical characteristics of the imported products (see recital 13).
(20) Weighted average prices in the Community fluctuated during 1985 around ECU 1 550 per tonne; they fell in 1986 to ECU 1 364 per tonne. In 1987, weighted average prices reached a low of ECU 1 288 per tonne and remained at that level during 1988, as a result of the Chinese imports.
These dumping prices prevented the Community producers from charging prices which would have covered their production costs and allowed a reasonable profit margin. This margin is lower than the margins attained before the imports from China started.
3. Impact of the imports on the situation of the Community producers
(a) Consumption, production capacity, production, capacity utilization and sales in the Community
(21) Community consumption of the product rose in 1987 by 11,2 % and remained at the same level in 1988.
Over the same period, Community production fell by 5,2 % from 111 321 tonnes in 1987 to 105 522 tonnes in 1988.
(22) In order to improve profitability, the Community producers reduced their production capacity from 146 061 tonnes in 1987 to 134 354 tonnes in 1988, a reduction of 8 %.
(23) Between 1986, the year preceding the penetration of the Community market by the Chinese product, and 1987, utilization of production capacity in the Community fell from 82,5 to 76,2 %, subsequently rising to 78,5 % following the capacity reduction.
(24) Despite restructuring by the Community producers and the increase in consumption referred to above, the Community industry's sales fell by 7,7 % in 1987 and rose by a mere 2 % or so in 1988.
(b) Jobs, profitability
(25) The workforce of the Community industry shrank by 5,4 % in 1987 and by 8,6 % in 1988.
(26) General price trends forced the Community producers to align their prices via a 4,9 % reduction in 1987 and a 1,5 % reduction in 1988.
(27) Except for the Spanish producer, which remains protected during the transitional period by a special customs duty higher than that applicable at the external frontier of the old Community in its composition on 30 December 1985, the Community producers either suffered considerable losses during this period or barely managed to cover their production costs, despite the increased consumption of silicon metal.
Losses sustained by the Community producers ranged from 1 to 13 % during the investigation period.
The Commission found that the Community industry sustained material injury through a substantial loss in profitability.
4. Cause and effect
(28) Since 1987 there has been considerable penetration by silicon metal originating in China at prices significantly lower than Community production costs.
(29) The trend in Community consumption does not explain the growth in imports from China, as may be seen from the figures for 1987 and 1988. The market share of the imported Chinese product more than doubled during those two years while Community consumption grew much more slowly in 1987 and remained constant in 1988.
(30) Moreover, imports from all other non-member countries fell from 59,3 % in 1987 to 52,7 % in 1988.
Imports in the three main non-member importing countries (Norway, South Africa and Brazil) remained stable.
The Commission found that import prices in all the non-member countries were higher than the Chinese prices.
(31) All this evidence led the Commission to conclude that the effects of imports of silicon metal originating in China, considered separately, must be considered to have caused material injury to the Community industry.
I. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(32) Given the material injury sustained by the Community silicon metal industry in terms of profitability and market share, the Commission considers that without measures to deal with the dumped imports, which have been shown to have caused injury, the Community industry is likely to have to cease production. Since silicon metal is a basic product for a number of high-technology industrial sectors and since total dependence on extra-Community supplies must be avoided, the Commission considers that the loss of Community production would have unwelcome consequences for a large section of the Community industry.
(33) Most of the non-member countries which produce silicon metal are far away from the Community market. In additon, account must be taken of the sizeable differences in the quality of the imported product and differences of technology in the non-member countries. The Commission also took into consideration the comments of a consumer-processor, which argued that it could sell its final product at competitive prices only by purchasing dumped imports.
The Commission found, however, that during the investigation period this consumer had purchased only 2,7 % of all its requirements of silicon metal from Chinese suppliers. Moreover, it should be recalled that the price advantages enjoyed by purchasers resulted from unfair practices and that there are no grounds for allowing the continued existence of unfair prices.
(34) The Commission therefore considers that it is in the Community's interest that fair competititon be re-established on the Community market and that the Community producers' interests take priority over those of the consumer-processors purchasing the dumped product.
J. PROVISIONAL ANTI-DUMPING DUTY
(35) To determine the rate of the provisional duty necessary to eliminate the injury, the Commission compared the average import price of the Chinese product with a theoretical selling price at which the Community producers could realize a profit; the average price differential was 14,7 %, i.e. 18,7 % on a cif basis.
In order to determine the theoretical selling price, the production costs of the Community producer considered to be most representative were adjusted by a profit margin of 6,5 %, considered to be the minimum margin guaranteeing the Community producers a reasonable return on investments.
The free-at-Community-frontier price must therefore be raised by this margin in order to eliminate the injury.
(36) In view of the above, the Commission considers that the provisional duty to be imposed should not be equal to the established dumping margin, since a rate of duty lower than the 38,7 % dumping margin would be sufficient to stop the injury attributable to the imports in question.
(37) In this respect the Commission took into account both the level of the import prices concerned, including the importer's margin and customs duties, and a minimum selling price which would allow the Community producers to cover production costs and make a reasonable profit.
(38) Since the investigation showed that the imports recorded in Community statistics as originating in Hong Kong in fact originated in China, a specific anti-dumping duty should not be imposed on the product from Hong Kong and the proceeding against Hong Kong should be terminated.
(39) A time limit should be set for the parties concerned to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing by the Commission,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EEC) No 720/90 of 22 March 1990 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon metal originating in the people's Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/686/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee set up pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 89/686/EEC provides that personal protective equipment may be placed on the market and brought into service only if it preserves the health and ensures the safety of users without prejudice to the health or safety of other individuals, domestic animals or goods, when properly maintained and used for its intended purpose.
(2) Pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 89/686/EEC, personal protective equipment bearing the CE marking and with respect to which the manufacturer is able to produce the declaration of conformity and the EC type-examination certificate issued by a notified body attesting to its conformity to the relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standards, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union by the Commission, is to be presumed to satisfy the basic health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 89/686/EEC and set out in Annex II thereto. Member States are required to publish the references of the national standards transposing the harmonised standards.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 89/686/EEC, the Commission and France have lodged a formal objection to the effect that standard EN 143:2000 ‘Respiratory Devices — Particle filters — Requirements, testing, marking’, approved by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 7 January 2000 and the references of which were first published in the Official Journal on 24 January 2001 (3), does not completely satisfy the basic health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 89/686/EEC with respect to particle filters, the filtering efficiency of which is exclusively or partially achieved by the use of materials based on non-woven electrically-charged fibres, hereinafter referred to as ‘electrostatic filters’.
(4) On the basis of the results of tests on the filtering efficiency of the various types of particle filters, there is substantive evidence that the test procedure for the measuring of filter penetration as set out in clauses 8.7.2.4, last sentence, and 8.7.3.4, last sentence, of standard EN 143:2000, according to which the measurement of penetration is taken three minutes after the start of the aerosol test, fails to ensure compliance with basic health and safety requirement 3.10.1 (Respiratory protection) of Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC with respect to electrostatic filters.
(5) Specifically, it has been observed that the filtering efficiency of this type of filter can deteriorate rapidly during use. The filtering efficiency as determined according to the standardised test procedure — three minutes after the start of the test — can become meaningless at any instance beyond these three minutes. The filtering efficiency drop can be drastic and therefore compromise the efficiency class allocated to an electrostatic filter and the information related to it. When the allocation to an efficiency class is deemed not correct during the period of use, the resulting potential exposure to dangerous airborne particulates can seriously harm the health and safety of the user. Test results point to a loss of filter efficiency of electrostatic filters also when used intermittently.
(6) In view of these findings, clauses 8.7.2.4, last sentence, and 8.7.3.4, last sentence, of standard EN 143:2000 also fail to ensure compliance with basic health and safety requirements 1.1.1 (Ergonomics), 1.1.2.1 (Highest level of protection possible) and 1.1.2.2 (Classes of protection appropriate to different levels of risk) of Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC with respect to electrostatic filters. In addition, clause 10 of the standard fails to ensure compliance with basic health and safety requirement 1.4(b) (Information supplied by the manufacturer), since no warning of the deterioration of the filtering efficiency of electrostatic filters over time is required.
(7) Accordingly, other related harmonised standards, which either provide that testing is to be done in accordance with standard EN 143:2000 or provide for a test measurement procedure identical to that set out in standard EN 143:2000, also fail to ensure compliance with the basic health and safety requirements of Directive 89/686/EEC referred to above with respect to electrostatic filters.
(8) At the request of the Commission the European Standardisation Organisation — CEN, Technical Committee CEN/TC 79 ‘Respiratory protective devices’, has started the revision of standard EN 143:2000 in order to address the described shortcomings. Pending this revision, in the interest of safety and legal certainty, the publication of the references of standard EN 143:2000 should be accompanied by an appropriate warning which should also be taken into account as regards the related harmonised standards. Member States should add an identical warning in their national standards transposing that harmonised standard.
(9) The references of harmonised standard EN 143:2000 should therefore be republished accordingly,","{'header': '17.3.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 80/76', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 16 March 2006\non the publication of the references of standard EN 143:2000 ‘Respiratory Devices — Particle filters — Requirements, testing, marking’ in accordance with Council Directive 89/686/EEC (personal protective equipment)\n(notified under document number C(2006) 777)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/216/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 89/686/EEC provides that personal protective equipment may be placed on the market and brought into service only if it preserves the health and ensures the safety of users without prejudice to the health or safety of other individuals, domestic animals or goods, when properly maintained and used for its intended purpose.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 89/686/EEC, personal protective equipment bearing the CE marking and with respect to which the manufacturer is able to produce the declaration of conformity and the EC type-examination certificate issued by a notified body attesting to its conformity to the relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standards, the references of which have been published in theOfficial Journal of the European Unionby the Commission, is to be presumed to satisfy the basic health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 89/686/EEC and set out in Annex II thereto.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3) and 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 6 May 2010, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the competent authority of Belgium an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 87701 soybean (‘the application’).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of MON 87701 soybean for the same uses as any other soybean with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. It also includes a monitoring plan for environmental effects conforming with Annex VII to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 26 July 2011, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. It concluded that soybean MON 87701, as described in the application, is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health or the environment (3).
(4) In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(6) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 87701 soybean as described in the application (‘the products’).
(7) A unique identifier should be assigned to each genetically modified organism (GMO) as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(8) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 87701 soybean. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5) lays down labelling requirements in Article 4(6) for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(10) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(11) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the EU register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(12) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (7).
(13) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(14) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman. An implementing act was deemed to be necessary and the chair submitted the draft implementing act to the appeal committee for further deliberation. The appeal committee did not deliver an opinion,","{'header': '14.2.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 40/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 10 February 2012\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified soybean MON 87701 (MON-877Ø1-2) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2012) 701)\n(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/83/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 6 May 2010, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the competent authority of Belgium an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 87701 soybean (‘the application’).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of MON 87701 soybean for the same uses as any other soybean with the exception of cultivation.

(3) The rules for applying emergency vaccination of domestic and feral pigs and the definition of marker vaccine are laid down in Directive 2001/89/EC.
(4) The Community already has in stock 1 000 000 doses of live attenuated vaccine against classical swine fever.
(5) Pursuant to Commission Decision 2002/106/EC of 1 February 2002 approving a Diagnostic Manual establishing diagnostic procedures, sampling methods and criteria for evaluation of the laboratory tests for the confirmation of classical swine fever (3), a suitable discriminatory test has recently been established to distinguish vaccinated pigs from pigs naturally infected with classical swine fever virus. Use of the marker vaccines already authorised for marketing in the Community can, therefore, be envisaged in the event of emergency vaccination of domestic pigs.
(6) Recent experience regarding the control of classical swine fever in feral pigs in the Community suggests that vaccination of such pigs by means of a vaccine administered via oral baits can be effective.
(7) For the purpose of reinforcing the Community capability to respond to classical swine fever, it is necessary to purchase an adequate number of doses of marker vaccine and of vaccine to be administered via oral baits and to make arrangements for keeping them in stock and having them rapidly available in case of an emergency.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes boric acid.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, boric acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(3) The Netherlands was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 7 July 2006 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 20 February 2009, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include boric acid in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric acid can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) However, unacceptable risks were identified for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood exposed to weathering. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.
(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Community level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Community level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to mitigate the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(8) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that specific risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing boric acid and used as wood preservatives. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks to these compartments have been identified during the evaluation. Products should also be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for professional and industrial users cannot be reduced by other means.
(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance boric acid and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing boric acid to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '1.8.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 201/50', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2009/94/EC\nof 31 July 2009\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include boric acid as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes boric acid.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, boric acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((3)) The Netherlands was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 7 July 2006 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.\n\n((4)) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 20 February 2009, in an assessment report.\n\n((5)) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include boric acid in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric acid can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((6)) However, unacceptable risks were identified for thein situtreatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood exposed to weathering. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.\n\n((7)) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Community level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Community level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to mitigate the identified risks to acceptable levels.\n\n((8)) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that specific risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing boric acid and used as wood preservatives. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks to these compartments have been identified during the evaluation. Products should also be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for professional and industrial users cannot be reduced by other means.\n\n((9)) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance boric acid and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n\n((10)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n\n((11)) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing boric acid to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((12)) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 August 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 September 2011.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of polyester staple fibre originating, inter alia, in Saudi Arabia
(2005/613/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNIITES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 428/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polyester staple fibre (PSF) originating in the People’s Republic of China and Saudi Arabia, amended the definitive anti-dumping duties in force on such imports originating in South Korea and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding in respect to such imports originating in Taiwan.
(2) Following disclosure of definitive findings, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic) presented to the Commission services, within the deadlines stipulated, an offer for price undertaking as well as a revised offer thereon, on its behalf and of all related companies, including the related producer of the product concerned Arabian Industrial Fibres Company (Ibn Rushd). This undertaking offer was not accepted due to the reasons set out in recital 292 of the definitive Regulation. In particular, the minimum prices originally offered by Sabic did not eliminate the injurious effect of dumping. In addition, the sales structure of this company in the Community was such that it did not allow an effective monitoring of the undertaking.
(3) Subsequent meetings between Sabic’s representatives and the Commission services then resulted in substantial revisions to the undertaking offer that overcame the above problems. The revised offer not only eliminated the injurious effect of dumping but also limited to a satisfactory degree the risk of circumvention in the form of cross-compensation with other products. In addition, the company amended its channels of sale in the Community to the extent that it was considered possible for the Commission to effectively monitor the undertaking.
(4) The final acceptable offer of a price undertaking was made by Sabic prior to the publication of the definitive findings, but at such a late stage in the proceeding that it was administratively impossible to include its acceptance in the definitive Regulation.
(5) The Community industry was informed of this revised offer and maintained that acceptance of a price undertaking would allow such imports to continue to cause serious injury to European producers, due to the cyclical nature of polyester staple fibre pricing.
(6) In this regard, it should be noted that the final offer made foresees the indexation of the minimum prices of PSF to public international quotations of its main raw materials, i.e. PTA and MEG. Consequently, the cyclical nature of PSF prices, which mainly reflects changes in the prices of its raw materials, is addressed in a way which reasonably eliminates the risk that the injurious dumping continues.
(7) Finally, the undertaking offer foresees reporting also on products other than PSF sold to the same clients by Sabic related customers in the Community. Therefore, the risk of cross-compensation with other products is to a great extent eliminated.
(8) Consequently, none of the arguments brought forward by the Community industry alters the Commission’s conclusion that the undertaking offered by Sabic eliminates the injurious effect of dumping and limits to a sufficient degree the risk of circumvention in the form of cross-compensation with other products.
B.   UNDERTAKING
(9) In view of the foregoing, the Commission considers that the undertaking offered by Sabic, which includes an indexation of the minimum prices to public quotations of its main raw materials, can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover, the regular and detailed reports which the company undertook to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring, and the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited,","{'header': '13.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 211/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 18 July 2005\naccepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of polyester staple fibre originating,inter alia, in Saudi Arabia\n(2005/613/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNIITES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertaking offered by the companies mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning polyester staple fibres originating in the People’s Republic of China and Saudi Arabia, is hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTARIC additional code\nSaudi Arabia\nProduced and sold by Arabian Industrial Fibres Company (Ibn Rushd), Yanbu Al-Sinaiyah, or produced by Arabian Industrial Fibres Company (Ibn Rushd), Yanbu Al-Sinaiyah, and sold by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), Riyadh, to the first customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA671'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 13(3) and Article 14(3) and (5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China.
(2) The request was lodged on 18 August 2003 by SX BĂźrowaren and Ringbuchtechnik Handelsgesellschaft GmbH on behalf of producers representing 100 % of the Community production of certain ring binder mechanisms.
B. PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention are certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China (the product concerned) normally declared under CN code ex 8305 10 00. These ring binder mechanisms consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half-rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover. They can be opened either by pulling the half-rings or by using a small steel-made trigger mechanism fixed to the product concerned (""certain ring binder mechanisms"").
(4) The product under investigation is certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam (the product under investigation), normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned.
(5) The CN codes are given for information only.
C. EXISTING MEASURES
(6) The measures currently in force and allegedly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97(3) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000(4).
D. GROUNDS
(7) The request contains sufficient evidence, that the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Vietnam of certain ring binder mechanisms.
(8) The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People's Republic of China and Vietnam to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China via Vietnam.
(9) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of certain ring binder mechanisms from Vietnam appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.
(10) Finally, the request contains sufficient evidence that the prices of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.
E. PROCEDURE
(11) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam, whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(a) Questionnaires
(12) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers in Vietnam, the exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China and to the importers in the Community known to the Commission or which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(13) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(14) The authorities of the People's Republic of China and Vietnam will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(15) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c) Exemption from registration of imports or measures
(16) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(17) The alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community. Article 13 of the basic Regulation is aiming at countering circumvention practices without affecting operators which can prove that they are not involved in such practices, but it does not contain a specific provision providing for the treatment of exporters which could establish that they are not involved in circumvention practices. Therefore, it appears necessary to introduce a possibility for exporters concerned to request an exemption from the registration of imports of their exported products or from measures on these imports. Exporters wishing to obtain an exemption should apply for it and submit any requested questionnaire reply within the appropriate time limits, in order for it to be established that they are not circumventing the anti-dumping duties within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. Importers could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from exporters which are granted such an exemption, and in accordance with Article 13(4).
F. REGISTRATION
(18) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration, of such imports consigned from Vietnam.
G. TIME LIMITS
(19) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
- interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
(20) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
H. NON-COOPERATION
(21) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits provided in this Regulation, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. Resorting to the provisions of Article 18 may result in findings less favourable to the party in question than if it had cooperated,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 1733/2003 of 30 September 2003 initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 on imports of certain ring binder mechanisms originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of certain ring binder mechanisms consigned from Vietnam, whether declared as originating in Vietnam or not, and making such imports subject to registration"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of certain ring binder mechanisms, falling within CN code ex 8305 10 00 (TARIC codes 8305 10 00 11 and 8305 10 00 21 ), consigned from Vietnam, whether originating in Vietnam or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 119/97 as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2100/2000.\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, ring binder mechanisms shall consist of two rectangular steel sheets or wires with at least four half-rings made of steel wire fixed on it and which are kept together by a steel cover.

Whereas the same rate of import duty is in general applicable to a group of products falling within a specified subheading of the Common Customs Tariff ; whereas the whole range of products classified in a subheading is thus to be taken into consideration when fixing the import duties;
Whereas the application of the normal import duty to mixtures and sets does not always lead to economically desirable results;
Whereas the exceptional nature of these mixtures and sets may encourage their manufacture with a view to benefiting from the application of a lower import duty;
Whereas rules should be established to ensure that mixtures and sets can be imported only when the appropriate import duties are applied ; whereas it is unavoidable that the application of such rules in certain cases will result in difficulties for both the administration and for the trade sector ; whereas the rules should be applied only in areas where problems exist or where they are necessary as a precautionary step;
Whereas in respect of mixtures where one of the components represents at least 90 % of the weight, no preventive measures are considered necessary;
Whereas the abovementioned rules may require specific detailed rules of implementation ; whereas such detailed rules should be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1870/80 (5), or in the corresponding Article in other Regulations on the common organization of markets;

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 27 July 1979  on proposed Netherlands Government assistance to increase the production capacity of a cigarette manufacturer  (Only the Dutch text is authentic)  (79/743/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments and having regard to these comments,
Whereas:  I
Article 6 of the Dutch Act of 29 June 1978 on the promotion and guidance of investment (1) introduced an additional premium for major schemes with paid for investment exceeding Fl 30 000 000. The amount depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question.
When examining the scheme at the bill stage, pursuant to the procedure under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that the additional premium for major schemes constituted a general aid system and contained no industry or regional objectives. Since the scheme covered investment by any firm in any area or industry it could not qualify for exemption to the incompatibility of State aids under Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). Without these objectives the Commission could not assess the scheme's effects on intra-Community trade and competition and check whether its application would be counter to its principles and rules on aids.
In line with the general approach previously taken on similar existing or proposed schemes in the Community, the Commission requested prior notification in good time of individual cases of application of the additional premium for major schemes, account being taken of the amount of investment concerned, as required by Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
During talks with the Dutch authorities the Commission stated that it would assess each case on its own merits in the light of the rules contained in Article 92 et seq. or rules developed later during administration. The Netherlands Government could not infer, by requesting regular prior notification, that the Commission had taken a favourable view of the additional premium.  (1)""Staatsblad"" No 368, 1978.
The Netherlands Government complied with the Commission's request by including the prior notification procedure in Articles 6 (7) and 7 (3) of Chapter V of the Dutch Act of 29 June 1978.
II
By letter dated 4 October 1978, the Netherlands Government informed the Commission, as required by the procedure, of its intention to grant the additional premium for major schemes to the Dutch subsidiary of a major multinational tobacco manufacturer.
The assistance was to be granted to the subsidiary for the purpose of concentrating and developing cigarette production in one of its two factories in the Netherlands which produced 11 100 million cigarettes in 1978. One factory, at Eindhoven, had been closed down and the annual production capacity of the other, located at Bergen-op-Zoom, was to be increased to 16 000 million cigarettes, a 40 % increase in production capacity of the firm and approximately a 13 % increase in Dutch production overall. Plant extensions and modernization would require an investment of Fl 165 million (some 60 77 million EUA).
When the investments were completed, the firm would account for almost 50 % of Dutch cigarette production, with the number of workers a little less than that in the previous two factories.
The firm expects to export over 80 % of its production to other Member States.
Dutch cigarette exports to other Member States in 1977 totalled 94 million EUA ; imports were 63 77 million EUA, a 30 74 million EUA trade surplus in cigarettes for the Netherlands.
For some years now growth in Community cigarette consumption and production has been very slack. Common Customs Tariff duties (subheading 24.02 A) on cigarettes are levied at 90 % ad valorem and encourage the firm to supply the Community market from Community production centres.
The additional premium for major schemes to be granted in this case amounts to Fl 6 72 million (2 73 million EUA), 3 78 % of the investment, almost the maximum rate for the additional premium.
On account of the firm's location in a regional development area the investment would also qualify for a Fl 10 million grant (3 77 million EUA) under the Dutch regional aid system (Investeringspremieregeling (IPR)), the rate of grant paid to improve socio-economic balance in the Bergen-op-Zoom area.
III
The Netherlands Government's proposed aid is likely, therefore, to affect trade and distort competition between Member States by favouring the undertaking within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
The terms of the Treaty provide for the incompatibility with the common market aids fulfilling the criteria it contains. The exemptions to incompatibility included in Article 92 (3) must be strictly interpreted, notably, aid may only be granted when the Commission can establish that it will contribute to the attainment of the objectives specified in the exemption, which under normal market conditions the recipient firms would not attain by their own actions.
Any granting of exemptions to aids without such compensatory justification would be tantamount to agreeing to a distortion of intra-Community trade and competition without grounds of Community interest while putting certain Member States at an undue advantage.
In the case in question there does not appear to be such a counterpart on the part of the undertaking's benefiting.
Effectively the Netherlands Government has not been able to give nor has the Commission found any grounds establishing that the proposed aid meets the conditions laid down to enforce derogations pursuant to Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
As regards the derogation of Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) on aid to favour the development of certain areas, it should be remembered that the standard of living in the Bergen-op-Zoom area is not abnormally low and that it does not suffer from serious under-employment within the meaning of the derogation (paragraph (a)). As regards the derogation of paragraph (c), the Netherlands Government has already taken account of the contribution made by the investment concerned to  improving the socio-economic balance of the area by granting assistance under the Dutch regional aid system (Investeringspremieregeling (IPR)). The Netherlands Government, in the framework of presenting its observations to the Commission, emphasized that the additional premium for major schemes was not given on account of regional considerations.
Moreover, in respect of the derogation envisaged in Article 92 (3) (b), the investment concerned does not constitute an important project of common European interest, considering also that when examining the additional premium, the Commission considered that given the relatively favourable socio-economic situation in the Netherlands when compared to the rest of the Community, that it could not be regarded as assistance ""to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State"". To take another viewpoint would permit the Netherlands, in the context of an economic downturn and large-scale unemployment throughout the whole Community, to effect to their advantage investments likely to be made in other Member States in a less-favourable situation. Recent economic and social developments in the Community provide grounds for maintaining this approach both as regards the system itself and any possible cases of application.
Finally, as regards the derogation of Article 92 (3) (c), in favour of aid as ""aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities"", examination of the cigarette manufacturing industry in the Community and in the Netherlands shows that since market conditions seem apt to ensure a normal development, that therefore the proposed aid cannot be considered as ""facilitating the development"". Moreover, it should be noted that, basically, the proposed increased production would mainly be exported to other Member States in a situation where the growth consumption has slackened, so that it is therefore unlikely that trading conditions would remain unaffected by a measure contrary to the common interest, such as this aid.
In view of the above, the Dutch aid proposal does not meet the conditions necessary to benefit from one of the derogations of Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '79/743/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 July 1979 on proposed Netherlands Government assistance to increase the production capacity of a cigarette manufacturer (Only the Dutch text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '6', 'title': 'Article 6 of the Dutch Act of 29 June 1978 on the promotion and guidance of investment (1) introduced an additional premium for major schemes with paid for investment exceeding Fl 30 000 000.

The amount depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question.\n\nWhen examining the scheme at the bill stage, pursuant to the procedure under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that the additional premium for major schemes constituted a general aid system and contained no industry or regional objectives. Since the scheme covered investment by any firm in any area or industry it could not qualify for exemption to the incompatibility of State aids under Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). Without these objectives the Commission could not assess the scheme\'s effects on intra-Community trade and competition and check whether its application would be counter to its principles and rules on aids.\n\nIn line with the general approach previously taken on similar existing or proposed schemes in the Community, the Commission requested prior notification in good time of individual cases of application of the additional premium for major schemes, account being taken of the amount of investment concerned, as required by Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty.\n\nDuring talks with the Dutch authorities the Commission stated that it would assess each case on its own merits in the light of the rules contained in Article 92 et seq. or rules developed later during administration.

One factory, at Eindhoven, had been closed down and the annual production capacity of the other, located at Bergen-op-Zoom, was to be increased to 16 000 million cigarettes, a 40 % increase in production capacity of the firm and approximately a 13 % increase in Dutch production overall. Plant extensions and modernization would require an investment of Fl 165 million (some 60 77 million EUA).\n\nWhen the investments were completed, the firm would account for almost 50 % of Dutch cigarette production, with the number of workers a little less than that in the previous two factories.\n\nThe firm expects to export over 80 % of its production to other Member States.\n\nDutch cigarette exports to other Member States in 1977 totalled 94 million EUA ; imports were 63 77 million EUA, a 30 74 million EUA trade surplus in cigarettes for the Netherlands.\n\nFor some years now growth in Community cigarette consumption and production has been very slack.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Tunisia (1986/1987)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 20 of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Tunisia (1) stipulates that certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Tunisia, specified in the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters of 16 October 1978 (2), and produced from the 1977 and subsequent harvests, shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties within the limits of an annual Community tariff quota of 50 000 hectolitres; whereas these wines must be put in containers holding two litres or less; whereas these wines must be accompanied by a certificate of designation of origin in accordance with the model given in Annex D to the Agreement in question; whereas the Community tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for the period 1 November 1986 to 31 October 1987;
Whereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas the wines in question shall benefit from this tariff quota on condition that Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (4), is complied with;
Whereas according to Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 449/86 of 24 February 1986 determining the arrangements to be applied by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to trade with certain third countries (5), the provisions applicable by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to trade with the Republic of Tunisia shall be subject to the tariff treatment and other trade rules applied to third countries enjoying most favoured-nation treatment; whereas therefore, this Regulation applies only to the Community of Ten;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for this quota to all imports of the products concerned into the Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas a system of using a Community tariff quota, based on allocation among the Member States, appears likely to comply with the Community nature of the said quota having regard to the above principles; whereas, in order to reflect most accurately the actual development of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States assessed by reference both to the statistics relating to imports of the said products from Tunisia over a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each of the types of wines in question are available and no reliable estimates of future imports can be made; whereas in these circumstances the quota volumes should be allocated in initial shares, taking into account demand for these wines on the markets of the various Member States;
Whereas, to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve intended to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States who have used up their initial share; whereas, in order to guarantee some degree of security to importers in each Member State, the first instalment of the Community quota should be fixed at a level which could, in the present circumstances, be 50 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may not be used up at the same rate; whereas, in order to take this into account and avoid disruption, any Member State which has used up almost all its initial share should draw a supplementary share from the reserve; whereas this should be done by each Member State each time one of its supplementary shares is almost used up, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and supplementary shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be in a position to follow the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States therof;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a Member States has a considerable quantity of the initial share left over, it is essential that it should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve to prevent a part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3387/86 of 3 November 1986 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Tunisia (1986/1987)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 96/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity(1), (hereinafter ""the Directive""), and in particular Article 24 thereof,
Having informed the Member States of the Austrian application,
Whereas:
I. FACTS
1. Procedure
(1) By letter of 11 February 1998, the Austrian Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Angelegenheiten notified to the Commission an application for a transitional regime pursuant to Article 24 of Directive 96/92/EC.
(2) On 23 March 1998, the Commission's representatives undertook a fact finding mission to Vienna and met with the Austrian Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Angelegenheiten as well as with representatives of consumers (social partners) and the electricity industry.
(3) By letter of 15 October 1998, the Austrian Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Angelegenheiten submitted to the Commission complementary information, in particular the final report of the independent accountants and lawyers commissioned by the Austrian Government to determine the anticipated level of compensatory payments arising from the transitional regime in question. On the basis of this report, the application for a transitional regime has been reduced by the Austrian Government to a stranded cost amount of ATS 8,7 billion from the ATS 35,6 billion contained in the initial notification.
2. The Austrian electricity sector and implementation of Directive 96/92/EC
(4) Austria is implementing Directive 96/92/EC by the Elektrizitätswirtschafts- und Organisationsgesetz (hereinafter ""ElWOG""), which was published on 18 August 1998 and entered into force on 19 February 1999, as well as complementary laws for the nine Länder. The ElWOG provides for a market opening starting with approximately 27 % in February 1999 and increasing to approximately 50 % in 2003. Accordingly, in the first phase final customers with more than 40 GWh yearly consumption as well as distributors, which also operate transmission systems, will be eligible. From February 2000, final customers above 20 GWh/a will be eligible, as well as all distributors above 40 GWh/a. Finally, in February 2003, all final customers and all distributors above 9 GWh/a will be eligible. Austria has opted for a system of regulated network access.
(5) Österreichische Elektrizitätswirtschafts AG (Verbundgesellschaft) is the main transmission system operator. Through its legally separated subsidiaries, it is also Austria's main electricity producing company. Most of the nine regional electricity companies are not only distributors but also producers; some of them are also transmission system operators.
3. The transitional regime notified by the Austrian Government
3.1. Introduction
(6) Austria has notified two schemes pursuant to Article 24 of Directive 96/92/EC.
(7) Guarantees of operation given to electricity generation plants based on the legal authorisation procedure for power plants prior to liberalisation. Authorisations for certain types of power plants were granted only if a corresponding electricity demand had been assessed (""Bedarfsprüfung""). Those power plants that received authorisation benefited from a guarantee of operation and guarantee of cost amortisation. The stranded cost regime in this respect seeks to compensate certain generating plants from the loss of income that can be expected from the lower prices resulting from the introduction of competition.
(8) The final notification of 15 October 1998 limits the plants eligible to the transitional regime to three hydropower plants: Freudenau, Mittlere Salzach and Kraftwerkskette Obere Drau, all operated by subsidiaries of Verbundgesellschaft.
(9) Long-term procurement contract for indigenous lignite for the ""Voitsberg"" power plant. The contract was concluded in 1977 between the lignite mine GKB and the power plant operator ÖDK, a subsidiary of Verbundgesellschaft. Additionally, the power plant benefits from a legal guarantee of operation of up to 3 % of the yearly domestic electricity consumption. The stranded cost regime thus seeks to compensate this generating plant (i) for its long-term obligation to purchase lignite above world coal/lignite prices, and (ii) for the loss of income regarding the expected lower prices resulting from the introduction of competition with respect to the legal guarantee of operation.
3.2. Details of the guarantees of operation given to electricity generation plants and the lignite procurement contract
(10) The proposed method is defined in recital 69 of the ElWOG. It provides for operating aid to compensate stranded costs in relation to the abovementioned commitments and guarantees of operation. On 11 February 1998, Austria preliminarily notified a total amount of stranded cost of ATS 35,58 billion (approximately EUR 2,5 billion). Based on a subsequent assessment of the stranded costs through independent accountants and lawyers, a final notification was submitted on 15 October 1998, which reduced the total stranded cost amount to ATS 8,7 billion (approximately EUR 0,6 billion) which consists of a maximum of ATS 6,27 billion for the three hydropower plants and ATS 2,43 billion for the lignite-fired power plant. The transitional regime is limited until 2009.
(11) Calculation method
In a first step the stranded costs were calculated for each power plant as the discounted difference between guaranteed cost coverage and expected market price for electricity taking into account the real market opening per company. In a second step, the degree to which the viability of the consolidated operating companies would be affected was assessed.
(12) Compensation method
With respect to the three hydropower plants, the transitional regime envisages the grant of operating aid, on an annual basis, in the light of developments in market prices for electricity, and the consequent effect this has on the viability of the hydro plants in question. With respect to the lignite fuelled plant, a fixed compensation payment is envisaged.
(13) Recovery method
The transitional regime envisages that the payments will be financed by the imposition of a levy per kWh of electricity purchased by eligible customers. Captive customers pay their proportional part within the regulated electricity tariff. The funds are collected by the network operators (via a charge on transmission) and administrated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs).
II. LEGAL ANALYSIS
1. Legal basis: Article 24(1) and (2) of Directive 96/92/EC
(14) The Austrian Government notified an application for a transitional regime with respect to alleged commitments and guarantees of operation pursuant to Article 24 of the Directive.
2. Requirements of Article 24
(15) Article 24 of Directive 96/92/EC states the following: ""1. Those Member States in which commitments or guarantees of operation given before the entry into force of this Directive may not be honoured on account of the provisions of this Directive may apply for a transitional regime which may be granted to them by the Commission, taking into account, amongst other things, the size of the system concerned, the level of interconnection of the system and the structure of its electricity industry. The Commission shall inform the Member States of those applications before it takes a decision, taking into account respect for confidentiality. This Decision shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
2. The transitional regime shall be of limited duration and shall be linked to expiry of the commitments or guarantees referred to in paragraph 1. The transitional regime may cover derogations from Chapters IV, VI and VII of this Directive. Applications for a transitional regime must be notified to the Commission no later than one year after the entry into force of this Directive.""
(16) Article 24(1) and (2) of Directive 96/92/EC, in the light of the EC Treaty, thus require the following elements to be examined by the Commission when considering any application for a transitional regime.
A. Requirements concerning the nature of the commitments or guarantees of operation in question
(17) (1) The existence of a commitment or guarantee of operation must be proven.
(2) The commitment or guarantees of operation must have been given before 20 February 1997.
(3) A causal link between the entry into force of the Directive and the inability to honour the commitment must be established.
B. Requirements concerning the measures proposed to achieve the objectives in question
(18) (1) The measures of the transitional regime must fall within the scope of derogations from Chapters IV, VI and VII of the Directive.
(2) The transitional regime must be of limited duration and linked to the expiry of the commitments or guarantees of operation in question.
(3) The transitional regime must apply the least restrictive measures reasonably necessary to achieve the objectives, which themselves must be legitimate. In deciding on these issues the Commission must take into account, amongst other things, the size of the system concerned, the level of interconnection of the system and the structure of its electricity industry.
3. Assessment of the Austrian transitional regime
(19) In the present case, concerning the transitional regime as notified, it is not necessary to determine whether requirements A(1), (2), (3) or B(2), (3) are met, because the measures of the transitional regime in question do not require a derogation from Chapter IV, VI or VII of Directive 96/92/EC and thus do not meet requirement B(1).
(20) As stated above, in order to constitute a transitional regime within the meaning of Article 24, the system chosen by the Member State must provide for a derogation from Chapter IV, VI or VII of Directive 96/92/EC.
(21) The measures in question are based on a pure compensation scheme, i.e. a system of charges or levies implemented by a Member State in order to compensate stranded costs caused by the application of Directive 96/92/EC. The application of such levies in the present case does not require a derogation from the abovementioned chapters of the Directive and cannot therefore be regarded as a transitional regime in the meaning of Article 24 of the Directive.
(22) The fact that measures such as those in question in this case can result in very considerable distortions of the single market for electricity do not affect this conclusion. Indeed, the Commission recognises that the payment of such levies can result in economic consequences substantially similar to those resulting from a total or partial derogation from some of the obligations contained in Chapters IV, VI or VII of the Directive. However, such distortions by their very nature do not result from such a specific derogation as envisaged by the Directive. The transfer of a compensation payment to certain electricity producers, financed through a levy or charge on consumers is, therefore, a measure which is not directly addressed by the Directive but one which needs to be examined pursuant to the rules on competition, and in particular Article 87(3)(c) of the EC Treaty. Under these circumstances, it is understood that measures of similar economic effect will be treated in a consistent manner, regardless of the relevant procedure in each individual case.
(23) In the light of the non-applicability of Article 24 of the Directive, it is not necessary to assess the further requirements A(1), (2), (3) and B(2) and (3).
4. Conclusions
(24) The transitional regime notified by the Austrian Government pursuant to Article 24 of Directive 96/92/EC has been assessed pursuant to Article 24(1) and (2). The Commission concludes that a transitional regime according to Article 24 cannot and need not be approved to the extent that the measures chosen do not constitute derogations from Chapters IV, VI and VII of the Directive.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1147/96 (2), and in particular Articles 5, 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the level which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas, difloxacin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, ethyl lactate, heptaminol, menthol, phloroglucinol and trime-thylphloroglucinol should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, carprofen and penethamate (for ovine and porcine) should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of the scientific studies in progress, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for thiabendazole;
Whereas it appears that maximum residue limits cannot be established for colchicine because residues, at whatever limit, in foodstuffs of animal origin constitute a hazard to the health of the consumer; whereas colchicine should therefore be inserted into Annex IV to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 8800 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 8(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003(4) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas:
(1) In order to combat tax evasion or avoidance and to simplify the procedure for charging value added tax, certain derogations covering similar problems were granted under varying terms to individual Member States by the Council pursuant to Article 27(1) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (3). A solution to the said problems should be made available to all Member States through incorporation into that Directive. Those measures should be proportionate and limited to countering the problem concerned. Given that the Member States have different needs, that incorporation should be limited to extending the option of adopting the rules concerned to all Member States, as and when the need arises.
(2) Member States should be able to take action to ensure that measures provided for in Directive 77/388/EEC relating to the taxable person and the transfer of a business as a going concern are not being exploited to evade and avoid tax.
(3) It should be possible for Member States to intervene as regards the value of supplies and acquisitions in specific limited circumstances, to ensure that there is no loss of tax through the use of connected parties to derive tax benefits.
(4) It should be possible for Member States to include, within the taxable amount of a transaction which involves the working of investment gold provided by a customer, the value of that investment gold where, by virtue of being worked, the gold loses its status of investment gold.
(5) It should be emphasised that certain services with the nature of capital items may be included in the scheme which allows the adjustment of deductions for capital items over the lifetime of the asset, according to its actual use.
(6) Member States should be able, in specific cases, to designate the recipient of supplies as the person responsible for paying and accounting for value added tax. This should assist Member States in simplifying the rules and countering tax evasion and avoidance in identified sectors and on certain types of transactions.
(7) Directive 77/388/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Consequently, Member States should not be able to continue to avail themselves of individual derogations granted to them by certain Council Decisions adopted pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC and which are covered by the provisions in this Directive. The Decisions concerned should therefore be explicitly repealed. This Directive should not affect measures applied by Member States pursuant to Article 27(5) of Directive 77/388/EEC; nor should it affect derogations which have been granted pursuant to Article 27(1) of that Directive and which have not been repealed by this Directive.
(9) The application of certain provisions in this Directive should be optional and they should allow Member States a certain degree of discretion. Where appropriate for reasons of transparency, it should be provided that Member States should inform the other Member States through the Advisory Committee on value added tax established under Article 29 of Directive 77/388/EEC of any national law adopted pursuant to those provisions. Such information should not be necessary with respect to national measures taken under a Decision which is repealed by this Directive, or which expires at the date of this Directive's entry into force, but which a Member State continues to apply under the provisions of this Directive,","{'header': '12.8.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 221/9', 'title': 'COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/69/EC\nof 24 July 2006\namending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards certain measures to simplify the procedure for charging value added tax and to assist in countering tax evasion or avoidance, and repealing certain Decisions granting derogations', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In order to combat tax evasion or avoidance and to simplify the procedure for charging value added tax, certain derogations covering similar problems were granted under varying terms to individual Member States by the Council pursuant to Article 27(1) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(3).

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (2), and in particular Article 84 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious, usually fatal, viral disease of domestic and wild boars which causes serious disturbances to intra-Union trade in and export to third countries of live pigs and products derived from animals of the porcine species.
(2) Following the confirmation of ASF in Georgia in 2007, the disease spread to the Russian Federation where numerous outbreaks of that disease have been reported in pigs and wild boar throughout the European part of Russia. Furthermore, in June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.
(3) The ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union constitutes a direct threat to pig holdings within the Union, because the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals and feed or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.
(4) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this diseases in the bordering territory of Belarus and the Russian Federation and they have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intended to adopt for the protection of their territories and of other Member States.
(5) Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boars and domestic pigs and have raised disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of their contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC (3) to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced. Lithuania is directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus, in order to minimise the risk of disease spread on its territory should ASF be introduced, Lithuania intends to establish a buffer zone of 10 kilometres along the border with Belarus, in which they will decrease the density of susceptible hosts by promoting slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings.
(6) Wild boars moving through borders between the affected third countries and the EU pose a risk of ASF introduction, especially in some areas with intensive agriculture where the wild boar is attracted by crops. As a short time risk mitigation measure, in an attempt to reduce this risk and based on available preliminary research data on the efficacy of the use of repellents consisting of synthetic odorous substances suggesting quite high efficiency and a relative long lasting period, Lithuania intends to apply these repellents in some areas of its territory close to its eastern border in order to deter wild boars from entering the maize and other crops fields.
(7) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU (4) lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and feed and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected, and that such cleansing and disinfection is properly documented.
(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009 (5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus and the Russian Federation, is higher than negligible and requires additional controls at the points of entry.
(9) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns.
(10) In the first week of August 2013, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and initial estimates of cost for the implementation of emergency measures in the areas considered at risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation. Financial support for personnel is required to ensure the implementation of the surveillance activities foreseen in the submitted plans. The plans have been examined by the Commission for Union financial contribution and were found to comply with Directive 2002/60/EC.
(11) The actions undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in order to directly reduce the risk of disease introduction into the Union, namely cleansing and disinfection of vehicles, should be co-financed at a rate of 100 %.
(12) The additional surveillance undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland in the areas at higher risk of disease introduction and the actions undertaken in the framework of the awareness campaign by those Member States should be co-financed at a rate of 50 %.
(13) The actions undertaken by Lithuania using repellents in defined high risk areas close to its eastern borders in order to reduce the risk of disease introduction into the Union via wild boar, should be co-financed at a rate of 50 %. The special actions undertaken by Lithuania to decrease the density of pigs at the border with Belarus should be co-financed at a rate of 30 %.
(14) Due to the urgency of the measures, the cost incurred by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland since 2 July 2013, the date of notification of the emergency measures, should be eligible for Union financial contributions.
(15) Article 8(3) of Decision 2009/470/EC provides that the eligible costs and the level, of the financial contribution from the Union must be set out. However, given the need to prevent excessive expenditure for the Union budget, maximum amounts are to be established which reflect the reasonable payment for certain surveillance activities.
(16) A reasonable payment is a payment for a material or a service at a proportionate price compared to the market price. Pending on-the-spot checks carried out by the Commission, it is now necessary to approve specific financial contribution from the Union to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
(17) The payment of the financial contribution shall be subject to the condition that the actions planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission.
(18) As the plans submitted by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for emergency measures against the introduction of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation carried out in 2013 are a sufficiently detailed framework in the meaning of Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (6), the present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided for in the work programme for grants.
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '12.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 272/47', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 10 October 2013\nconcerning a Union financial contribution towards surveillance and other emergency measures implemented in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland against African swine fever in neighbouring third countries\n(notified under document C(2013) 6540)\n(Only the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish texts are authentic)\n(2013/498/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious, usually fatal, viral disease of domestic and wild boars which causes serious disturbances to intra-Union trade in and export to third countries of live pigs and products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n\n((2)) Following the confirmation of ASF in Georgia in 2007, the disease spread to the Russian Federation where numerous outbreaks of that disease have been reported in pigs and wild boar throughout the European part of Russia. Furthermore, in June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.\n\n((3)) The ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union constitutes a direct threat to pig holdings within the Union, because the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals and feed or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n\n((4)) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this diseases in the bordering territory of Belarus and the Russian Federation and they have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intended to adopt for the protection of their territories and of other Member States.\n\n((5)) Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boars and domestic pigs and have raised disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of their contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC(3)to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced. Lithuania is directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus, in order to minimise the risk of disease spread on its territory should ASF be introduced, Lithuania intends to establish a buffer zone of 10 kilometres along the border with Belarus, in which they will decrease the density of susceptible hosts by promoting slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings.\n\n((6)) Wild boars moving through borders between the affected third countries and the EU pose a risk of ASF introduction, especially in some areas with intensive agriculture where the wild boar is attracted by crops. As a short time risk mitigation measure, in an attempt to reduce this risk and based on available preliminary research data on the efficacy of the use of repellents consisting of synthetic odorous substances suggesting quite high efficiency and a relative long lasting period, Lithuania intends to apply these repellents in some areas of its territory close to its eastern border in order to deter wild boars from entering the maize and other crops fields.\n\n((7)) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU(4)lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and feed and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected, and that such cleansing and disinfection is properly documented.\n\n((8)) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009(5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus and the Russian Federation, is higher than negligible and requires additional controls at the points of entry.\n\n((9)) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns.\n\n((10)) In the first week of August 2013, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and initial estimates of cost for the implementation of emergency measures in the areas considered at risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Czech Republic’s application of 20 October 2004 to register the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2).
(2) Austria and Germany submitted objections to the registration pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The objections were deemed admissible under points (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) By letters dated 21 January 2008, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.
(4) Given that no agreement was reached between Austria and the Czech Republic nor between Germany and the Czech Republic within the designated timeframe, the Commission should adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(5) Concerning the alleged failure of compliance with Article 2 in respect of the delimitation of the geographical area and production within it, use of and characteristics of the thermal spring water, and the appearance of a graphic motif on the wafers, the national authorities responsible provided confirmation that these elements were correct and in addition no manifest error was identified. The national authorities further provided evidence to show the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ was used in the sense of Article 2(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 and was proposed by the identified producer group.
(6) The terms ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ and ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ were found to be mutual translations of each other in the German and Czech languages respectively. The statements of objection from Germany showed that trade marks including the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ had been registered prior to the application for registration of the term ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ as a protected geographical indication. Some evidence was provided to show that in a further instance, a name may have acquired the status of a trade mark established by use. Evidence was further provided to show that consumers in Germany associated the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ with a certain type of wafer. However no evidence was provided in the statements of objection that consumers strongly associated the wafers with all or any of the trade marks as distinct from the descriptive term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, nor that consumers would be liable to be misled as to the true identity of a product marketed under the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’. Therefore, the Commission cannot conclude that the registration of the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ would be contrary to Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(7) As a salient part of the names ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ and ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ is identical, it is reasonable to conclude that the names are partly identical for the purposes of Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Furthermore, as mutual translations of each other, and given the phonetic and visual similarities between the products and their common origins, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, and in particular point (b) of paragraph (1) thereof, could have the result that ‘Karlovarské oplatky’, if registered, would be found by a competent court to be protected against the use of the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ on the wafers concerned. The evidence therefore shows that the continued existence of the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ would be jeopardised by the registration of ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ within the meaning of point (c) of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(8) The statements of objection were declared admissible on the ground, inter alia, that registration of the proposed name would jeopardise the existence of a partly identical name, namely ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, in so far that this name is used for a product and not protected under trade mark legislation. The evidence further shows that the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ originated from producers in the town formerly known as Karlsbad and that production of the wafer so named has continued for a considerable period of time. Moreover, the evidence shows that the uses of the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ referred to an authentic and traditional product having a common origin with ‘Karlovarské oplatky’, but was generally not meant to exploit the reputation of the latter name. For these reasons, and in the interests of fairness and traditional usage, the maximum transitional period foreseen by Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should be foreseen.
(9) Concerning trade marks containing the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ that were protected through registration or acquired by use prior to the application for registration of ‘Karlovarské oplatky’, the conditions of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 not being met, the said trade marks cannot be invalidated nor can their continued use be hindered by virtue of the registration of ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ as a protected geographical indication, provided the general requirements under trade mark legislation are otherwise met.
(10) Concerning generic status, the evidence provided in the statements of objection referred to the alleged general use of the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ in Germany and Austria, and not to that of ‘Karlovarské oplatky’. While the objections have provided evidence to show that a number of uses as general descriptive terms exist including the German mention ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, no evidence has been provided that the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ is used to designate a category of products that do not originate in the region of Karlovy Vary. The name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ was protected as a geographical indication in 1967 in the Czech Republic. The objection does not take into consideration the situation in the Czech Republic. Therefore, on the basis of information provided the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ cannot be considered to be generic and there is no failure of compliance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(11) In the light of the above, the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications subject to a transitional period of 5 years during which time the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ may continue to be used in circumstances that, without such a transitional period, could be contrary to the protection provided for by Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,","{'header': '29.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 197/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 744/2011\nof 28 July 2011\nentering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Karlovarské oplatky (PGI))', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0510/2006, the Czech Republic’s application of 20 October 2004 to register the name ‘Karlovarské oplatky’ was published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2).\n\n((2)) Austria and Germany submitted objections to the registration pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0510/2006. The objections were deemed admissible under points (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation.\n\n((3)) By letters dated 21 January 2008, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.\n\n((4)) Given that no agreement was reached between Austria and the Czech Republic nor between Germany and the Czech Republic within the designated timeframe, the Commission should adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0510/2006.\n\n((5)) Concerning the alleged failure of compliance with Article 2 in respect of the delimitation of the geographical area and production within it, use of and characteristics of the thermal spring water, and the appearance of a graphic motif on the wafers, the national authorities responsible provided confirmation that these elements were correct and in addition no manifest error was identified.

Some evidence was provided to show that in a further instance, a name may have acquired the status of a trade mark established by use. Evidence was further provided to show that consumers in Germany associated the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ with a certain type of wafer.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 27 June 1997 on the approval of the single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Basse-Normandie concerned by Objective 2 in France (Only the French text is authentic) (97/723/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 9,310 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 3809 of 16 December 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 3 December 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Basse-Normandie; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/1 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of France;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been complied with,","{'title': '97/723/EC: Commission Decision of 27 June 1997 on the approval of the single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Basse- Normandie concerned by Objective 2 in France (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Basse-Normandie concerned by Objective 2 in France, covering the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe single programming document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional policies of France;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. regional support for companies and training of employees,\n\n2. reindustrialization of the area of Caen,\n\n3. continuation of the conversion of the area of Cherbourg,\n\n4. technical assistance;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the single programming document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the provisions on financial implementation,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the single programming document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000 (2), provides for an annual preferential tariff quota of 11 475 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, distributed among Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro including Kosovo.
(2) The Interim Agreement with Croatia, approved by Council Decision 2002/107/EC of 28 January 2002 on the conclusion of an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part (3), and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, approved by Council and Commission Decision 2004/239/EC, Euratom of 23 February 2004 concerning the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part (4), lay down annual preferential tariff quotas of 9 400 tonnes and 1 650 tonnes respectively.
(3) Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2248/2001 of 19 November 2001 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other part and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Croatia (5) and Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 153/2002 of 21 January 2002 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (6) provide that detailed rules for the implementation of concessions on ‘baby beef’ should be laid down.
(4) For control purposes, Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 makes imports under the quotas of ‘baby beef’ for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro, including Kosovo, subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex II to that Regulation. For the sake of harmonisation, imports under the quotas of ‘baby beef’ originating in Croatia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should also be made subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the goods originate from the issuing country and that they correspond exactly to the definition in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Interim Agreement with Croatia. A model should also be established for the certificates of authenticity and detailed rules laid down for their use.
(5) Kosovo, as defined by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, is subject to an international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), which has also set up a separate customs service. There should therefore also be a specific certificate of authenticity for goods originating in the Serbia Montenegro/Kosovo.
(6) The quotas concerned should be managed through the use of import licences. To this end, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (8), should be applicable subject to this Regulation.

Whereas Decision 80/47/EEC requires Member States to have prior authorization from the Commission before introducing intra-Community surveillance of the imports concerned;
Whereas in accordance with Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/71 (2) on safeguard measures provided for in the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey, the Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 3639/84 (3), introduced protective measures in respect of imports into the Community of certain textile products originating in this third country;
Whereas such measures were authorized because of the massive and rapid increase of the imports concerned into the Community and because of the damage to Community producers;
Whereas, under such safeguard measures, imports into the Community of the textile products in question originating in Turkey are subject, until 30 June 1985, to quantitative limits;
Whereas, under such measures, disparities exist in the conditions governing imports of such textile products into the different Member States; whereas such disparities may give rise to deflection of trade;
Whereas, in order to deflect rapidly deflections of trade which could aggravate or give rise to economic difficulties in the sector concerned, the Government of the United Kingdom requested the Commission, under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC, for authorization to apply prior intra-Community surveillance to imports of textile products falling within categories 4, 6 and 83, originating in Turkey and put into free circulation in the other Member States;
Whereas the Commission has examined whether the imports concerned could be made subject to intra-Community surveillance measures under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC;
Whereas this examination has shown that there is a risk of deflections of trade occurring via the other Member States, thus jeopardizing the objectives aimed at by the safeguard measures indicated above and aggravating or prolonging the economic difficulties of the industry concerned;
Whereas, in these circumstances there is a reason to authorize the United Kingdom, until 30 June 1985, to apply intra-Community surveillance to imports of the textile products in question originating in Turkey and put into free circulation in the other Member States,","{'title': '85/145/EEC: Commission Decision of 15 January 1985 authorizing the United Kingdom to apply intra-Community surveillance to imports of certain textile products originating in Turkey (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe United Kingdom is authorized to introduce until 30 June 1985, in accordance with Decision 80/47/EEC, intra-Community surveillance of imports of the textile products falling within categories 4, 6 and 83, originating in Turkey and put into free circulation in the other Member States.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom\n\nDone at Brussels, 15 January 1985.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilly DE CLERCQ\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 16, 22. 1. 1980, p. 14.\n\n(2) OJ No L 192, 26. 8. 1971, p. 14.\n\n(3) OJ No L 335, 22. 12. 1984, p. 28.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2) and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products referred to in Part XX of Annex I to that Regulation and prices in the Union for those products may be covered by an export refund.
(2) In view of the current situation on the market in poultrymeat, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products which are authorised to move freely in the Union and bear the identification mark provided for in Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products should also comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3).
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 48/2012 (4). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Whereas:
(1) Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 lays down that the guaranteed total quantities for Finland may be increased to compensate ""SLOM"" producers, up to a maximum of 200000 tonnes. In accordance with Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 671/95(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1390/95(4), Finland has notified the quantities concerned for the 2002/2003 marketing year.
(2) Article 4(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 lays down that the individual reference quantities are increased or established at the duly justified request of producers to take account of changes affecting their deliveries and/or direct sales and that the increase or establishment of such a reference quantity is subject to a corresponding reduction or cancellation of the other reference quantity the producer owns.
(3) Such adjustments may not lead to an increase, for the Member State concerned, in the sum of the deliveries and direct sales referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin. In particular, it provides that products of animal origin are to be imported only from a third country or a part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up and updated in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists, account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees by the competent authorities of third countries as regards compliance or equivalence with Union feed and food law and animal health rules specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(3) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted (3) lists those third countries which satisfy the criteria referred to in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and are therefore able to guarantee that those products meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Union legislation to protect the health of consumers and can accordingly be exported to the Union. In particular, Annex II to that Decision sets out a list of third countries and territories from which imports into the Union of fishery products for human consumption, other than live, chilled, frozen or processed bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropodes, are permitted.
(4) The autonomous country of the Netherlands Antilles is currently included in the list in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC as a third country from which imports of fishery products intended for human consumption are permitted.
(5) Following an internal reform in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, effective as of 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist as an autonomous country within that Kingdom. On that same date, Curaçao and Sint Maarten gained the status of autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became special municipalities of the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is therefore appropriate to delete the entry for the Netherlands Antilles from the list set out in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC.
(6) The competent authorities of Curaçao and Sint Maarten have presented the necessary information to the Commission to prove that the sanitary control system in place in those autonomous countries provides sufficient guarantees of compliance with Union requirements. The information provided by the competent authorities of Curaçao and Sint Maarten also shows that those authorities have the same legal powers to conduct controls as the competent authority of the Netherlands Antilles used to have and that food business operators are bound by the same obligations as in the period before the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist. In addition, according to that information, the official sanitary controls in those autonomous countries continue at the same levels as in the period before the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist.
(7) It is therefore appropriate that Curaçao and Sint Maarten be included in the list set out in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC.
(8) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '19.10.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 288/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 October 2012\namending Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC as regards the inclusion of Curaçao and Sint Maarten in the list of third countries and territories from which imports of certain fishery products for human consumption are permitted and the deletion of the Netherlands Antilles from that list\n(notified under document C(2012) 7147)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/650/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 lays down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Following consultation of the opinion of the Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(1) The first measures to benefit from Community assistance under the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession (ISPA) established by Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999(4) were appraised and approved by the Commission in the course of 2000.
(2) Certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 should be amended in the light of experience acquired in the meantime in appraising and approving measures to be financed under ISPA.
(3) Co-financing of measures together with international financial institutions in particular and the use of private financing are key elements of the functioning of ISPA. In certain cases, access to sources of financing other than Community assistance is essential to allow the beneficiary countries to co-finance measures which fully meet the conditions for eligibility and the objectives of ISPA.
(4) In order to allow or facilitate co-financing together with international financial institutions and/or private sources, provision should be made for the possibility of derogating, after examination on a case-by-case basis, from the general rules on participation in invitations to tender and contracts co-financed under ISPA.
(5) Article 114(2) of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(5) stipulates that in exceptional cases and with proper justification, it may be decided, on the basis of the specific conditions laid down in the basic instruments governing cooperation and in accordance with the appropriate authorisation procedures, to allow nationals of third countries to tender for contracts. Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 is such a basic instrument.
(6) In this connection, inspiration may usefully be drawn from certain provisions applicable under the PHARE programme established by Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(6) on economic aid to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
(7) A more precise definition of the concept of eligible expenditure is required so as to allow co-financing of ISPA measures by other sources of external aid.
(8) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 should moreover be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Together with Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) constitutes an important building block in the completion of a single euro payments area (SEPA), where no distinction between cross-border and national payments in euro is to be made. The main objective of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 is the migration from national credit transfer and direct debit schemes to harmonised SEPA credit transfer (SCT) and SEPA direct debit (SDD) schemes, inter alia, by providing Union citizens with a unique international bank account number (IBAN) that can be used for all SCTs and SDDs denominated in euro.
(2) Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 has provided for the SEPA migration to take place by 1 February 2014 in order to allow payment service providers and payment service users sufficient time to adapt their processes to the technical requirements that the migration to SCT and SDD entail.
(3) Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 the Commission and the European Central Bank have closely monitored the progress of SEPA migration. Several meetings with Member States, national public authorities and market participants have been held. The European Central Bank has regularly published progress reports on SEPA migration on the basis of payment data collected by national central banks. Those reports indicate that a number of Member States in the euro area are well on track with migration rates for SCT currently close to 100 %. The large majority of payment service providers have reported that they are already SEPA-compliant. However, in several other Member States the migration rates are lagging behind expectations. This is particularly the case for SDD.
(4) On 14 May 2013, the ECOFIN Council in its conclusions again stressed the importance of SEPA migration. It was noted that the SEPA migration was far from complete and that immediate efforts would be required by all market participants to complete SEPA migration in time. An action plan was adopted in which merchants, corporates, SMEs and public administrations were invited to immediately take the necessary concrete internal steps to adapt their processes and inform their clients of their IBAN details.
(5) Despite the considerable efforts made by the European Central Bank, Member States, their national public authorities and market participants during recent months, the latest migration statistics show that the overall migration rate in the euro area to SCT has only increased from 40 % in June 2013 to around 64 % in November 2013, while the overall migration rate towards SDD has only reached 26 %. While the national figures show good progress in several Member States, a significant group of Member States is lagging considerably behind the expected migration rates. It is therefore very unlikely that all market participants will be SEPA compliant by 1 February 2014.
(6) From 1 February 2014, banks and other payment service providers will have to refuse to process credit transfers or direct debits that are not SEPA-compliant because of their legal obligations, although, as is currently already the case, they technically could process those payments by continuing to use existing legacy payment schemes alongside SCT and SDD. Failing full migration to SCT and SDD, delays in those payments cannot therefore be excluded. All payment services users, and particularly SMEs and consumers, could be affected.
(7) It is essential to avoid unnecessary disruption of payments resulting from the fact that SEPA migration is not fully completed by 1 February 2014. Payment service providers should therefore be allowed, for a limited period of time, to continue the processing of payment transactions through their legacy schemes alongside their SCT and SDD schemes, as they are doing now. A transitional period should therefore be introduced to allow for the continuation of such parallel processing of payments in different formats. Considering the current migration figures and the expected pace of migration, a one-off additional transitional period of six months is appropriate. Such ‘grandfathering’ of non-SEPA compliant legacy systems should be considered to be an exceptional measure and should therefore be kept as short as possible, as rapid and comprehensive migration is necessary in order to achieve the full benefits of an integrated payments market. It is also important to limit in time the costs to the payment service providers of the continued use of the legacy payment schemes in parallel with the SEPA system. Payment service providers that have already fully migrated to SEPA might consider providing payment service users that have not yet migrated with conversion services during the transitional period. During the transitional period, Member States should refrain from applying penalties to payment service providers that process non-compliant payments and to payment service users that have not yet migrated.
(8) Several large users of direct debit instruments have already indicated that they plan to migrate close to the end-date. Any postponing of those migration projects could lead to temporary stress on incoming payments and cash flows, and hence on treasury levels of the companies concerned. Such late migration on a large scale could also create certain bottlenecks, in particular at the level of banks and software vendors which may be faced with certain capacity constraints. The additional period for phasing in the new system would allow for a more gradual approach. Market participants that have not yet started to implement the necessary adaptations for SEPA compliance are called upon to do so as soon as possible. Market participants that have already started to adapt their payment processes should nevertheless complete the migration as rapidly as possible.
(9) In view of the overall objective to realise coordinated and integrated migration, it is appropriate that the transitional period apply to both SCT and SDD. Different transitional periods for SCT and SDD would cause confusion to consumers, payment service providers, SMEs and other payment service users.
(10) For reasons of legal certainty and in order to avoid any discontinuity to the application of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012, it is necessary that this Regulation enter into force as a matter of urgency and that it apply, with retroactive effect, from 31 January 2014.
(11) In view of the urgency of the matter, an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, should apply.
(12) Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '20.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 84/1', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 248/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\namending Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 as regards the migration to Union-wide credit transfers and direct debits\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Together with Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)constitutes an important building block in the completion of a single euro payments area (SEPA), where no distinction between cross-border and national payments in euro is to be made. The main objective of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 is the migration from national credit transfer and direct debit schemes to harmonised SEPA credit transfer (SCT) and SEPA direct debit (SDD) schemes, inter alia, by providing Union citizens with a unique international bank account number (IBAN) that can be used for all SCTs and SDDs denominated in euro.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 has provided for the SEPA migration to take place by 1 February 2014 in order to allow payment service providers and payment service users sufficient time to adapt their processes to the technical requirements that the migration to SCT and SDD entail.\n\n((3)) Since the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 the Commission and the European Central Bank have closely monitored the progress of SEPA migration. Several meetings with Member States, national public authorities and market participants have been held. The European Central Bank has regularly published progress reports on SEPA migration on the basis of payment data collected by national central banks. Those reports indicate that a number of Member States in the euro area are well on track with migration rates for SCT currently close to 100\xa0%. The large majority of payment service providers have reported that they are already SEPA-compliant. However, in several other Member States the migration rates are lagging behind expectations. This is particularly the case for SDD.\n\n((4)) On 14 May 2013, the ECOFIN Council in its conclusions again stressed the importance of SEPA migration. It was noted that the SEPA migration was far from complete and that immediate efforts would be required by all market participants to complete SEPA migration in time. An action plan was adopted in which merchants, corporates, SMEs and public administrations were invited to immediately take the necessary concrete internal steps to adapt their processes and inform their clients of their IBAN details.\n\n((5)) Despite the considerable efforts made by the European Central Bank, Member States, their national public authorities and market participants during recent months, the latest migration statistics show that the overall migration rate in the euro area to SCT has only increased from 40\xa0% in June 2013 to around 64\xa0% in November 2013, while the overall migration rate towards SDD has only reached 26\xa0%. While the national figures show good progress in several Member States, a significant group of Member States is lagging considerably behind the expected migration rates. It is therefore very unlikely that all market participants will be SEPA compliant by 1 February 2014.\n\n((6)) From 1 February 2014, banks and other payment service providers will have to refuse to process credit transfers or direct debits that are not SEPA-compliant because of their legal obligations, although, as is currently already the case, they technically could process those payments by continuing to use existing legacy payment schemes alongside SCT and SDD. Failing full migration to SCT and SDD, delays in those payments cannot therefore be excluded. All payment services users, and particularly SMEs and consumers, could be affected.\n\n((7)) It is essential to avoid unnecessary disruption of payments resulting from the fact that SEPA migration is not fully completed by 1 February 2014. Payment service providers should therefore be allowed, for a limited period of time, to continue the processing of payment transactions through their legacy schemes alongside their SCT and SDD schemes, as they are doing now. A transitional period should therefore be introduced to allow for the continuation of such parallel processing of payments in different formats. Considering the current migration figures and the expected pace of migration, a one-off additional transitional period of six months is appropriate. Such ‘grandfathering’ of non-SEPA compliant legacy systems should be considered to be an exceptional measure and should therefore be kept as short as possible, as rapid and comprehensive migration is necessary in order to achieve the full benefits of an integrated payments market. It is also important to limit in time the costs to the payment service providers of the continued use of the legacy payment schemes in parallel with the SEPA system. Payment service providers that have already fully migrated to SEPA might consider providing payment service users that have not yet migrated with conversion services during the transitional period. During the transitional period, Member States should refrain from applying penalties to payment service providers that process non-compliant payments and to payment service users that have not yet migrated.\n\n((8)) Several large users of direct debit instruments have already indicated that they plan to migrate close to the end-date. Any postponing of those migration projects could lead to temporary stress on incoming payments and cash flows, and hence on treasury levels of the companies concerned. Such late migration on a large scale could also create certain bottlenecks, in particular at the level of banks and software vendors which may be faced with certain capacity constraints. The additional period for phasing in the new system would allow for a more gradual approach. Market participants that have not yet started to implement the necessary adaptations for SEPA compliance are called upon to do so as soon as possible. Market participants that have already started to adapt their payment processes should nevertheless complete the migration as rapidly as possible.\n\n((9)) In view of the overall objective to realise coordinated and integrated migration, it is appropriate that the transitional period apply to both SCT and SDD. Different transitional periods for SCT and SDD would cause confusion to consumers, payment service providers, SMEs and other payment service users.\n\n((10)) For reasons of legal certainty and in order to avoid any discontinuity to the application of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012, it is necessary that this Regulation enter into force as a matter of urgency and that it apply, with retroactive effect, from 31 January 2014.\n\n((11)) In view of the urgency of the matter, an exception to the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, should apply.\n\n((12)) Regulation (EU) No 260/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nIn Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 260/2012, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from Article 6(1) and (2), PSPs may continue, until 1 August 2014, to process payment transactions in euro in formats that are different from those required for credit transfers and direct debits pursuant to this Regulation.\nMember States shall apply the rules on the penalties applicable to infringements of Article 6(1) and (2), laid down in accordance with Article 11, from 2 August 2014.\nBy way of derogation from Article 6(1) and (2), Member States may allow PSPs to provide PSUs, until 1 February 2016, with conversion services for national payment transactions enabling PSUs that are consumers to continue using BBAN instead of the payment account identifier specified in point (1)(a) of the Annex on condition that interoperability is ensured by converting the payer’s and the payee’s BBAN technically and securely into the respective payment account identifier specified in point (1)(a) of the Annex.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 143 thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission made after consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
Whereas:
(1) Romania has implemented a substantial reform programme since 2009. Under two balance-of-payments programmes, Romania has largely corrected its external macroeconomic imbalances. In addition, on 21 June 2013, the Council, by Decision 2013/318/EU (1), abrogated Decision 2009/590/EC (2) on the existence of an excessive deficit in Romania. Fiscal consolidation should be continued in line with the Stability and Growth Pact requirements with a view to meeting the medium-term objective in 2015. The Government has regained full access to market-based financing and the exchange rate has been broadly stable since mid-2009.
(2) Macroeconomic and financial stability should be consolidated through the pursuit of prudent policies. Structural reforms that were initiated under the previous programmes should be pursued and, where appropriate, reinforced to reduce vulnerabilities and strengthen the basis for future growth and catching up.
(3) The Council is to review on a regular basis the economic policies implemented by Romania, in particular in the context of the annual reviews of Romania's update of the Convergence Programme and implementation of the National Reform Programme and the regular review of progress made by Romania in the context of the convergence report.
(4) While in the baseline scenario of the economic programme, total gross financing needs until the end of 2015 are fully covered, and the Government continues to have access to market-based financing, the risks surrounding the baseline scenario support Romania's request for a financial assistance of a precautionary nature as a follow on to the assistance granted under Council Decisions 2009/458/EC (3) and 2011/289/EU (4).
(5) The Romanian authorities have requested financial assistance from the Union and other international financial institutions to support balance of payments sustainability and to ensure that international currency reserves can be kept at a prudent level even in the case of adverse economic developments.
(6) Despite improvements in its current account, Romania remains vulnerable to exchange-rate volatility and volatile international capital movements. In an adverse scenario marked by a retrenchment of the current abundant liquidity, situations could arise in which the financing costs for Romania would increase and possibly do so in a rapid way. Furthermore, adverse developments in the euro area could cause renewed pressures on the banking sector.

of 22 November 1985
concerning applications submitted by Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG, Gronau, for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of cotton yarn originating in Turkey
(Only the German text is authentic)
(85/515/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
1. On 3 December 1981 the Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 3453/81 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty of 16 % on certain cotton yarn originating in Turkey; on 3 April 1982, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 789/82 (3), a definitive anti-dumping duty of 12 % was imposed on the product concerned and the amounts secured by way of provisional duty from 1 January 1982 pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3453/81 were definitively collected up to the amount of the definitive duty.
2. On 30 July 1982, an arrangement was agreed upon between the Commission, on the one hand, and the Turkish Government and the Turkish Textile Exporters' Association, on the other. Under the terms of this arrangement the Turkish authorities and exporters agreed to raise the prices for exports of cotton yarn to the Community to specified levels (hereinafter called 'the arrangement prices'). The arrangement also provided for the periodic updating of these prices to take account of changes in raw cotton prices in Turkey which would have corresponding effects on prices of cotton yarn in Turkey. The initial arrangement prices were equivalent to the normal values definitively determined in Regulation (EEC) No 789/82 and, consequently, eliminated the dumping margin as finally established. Because of this arrangement it was decided that it was no longer necessary to levy an anti-dumping duty. The definitive duty was therefore cancelled by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2306/82 (4). Regulation (EEC) No 789/82, however, continued to apply for those goods which had already been introduced into the customs territory of the Community but not yet released into free circulation.
3. Between 1 April 1982 and 31 August 1983 Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG Gronau, an importer of cotton yarn from Turkey, submitted several applications to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany for refunds of amounts totalling . . . DM (5) which it had definitively paid in anti-dumping duties on its imports of cotton yarn from Turkey. The German authorities forwarded the applications to the Commission.
4. Following the submission by the applicant of further supporting evidence, the applications were examined by the Commission. The applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunitiy to comment on it. The comments made were taken into consideration prior to this Decision.
5. The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. None of the Member States disagreed with the opinion of the Commission.
B. Arguments of the applicant
6. The applicant has based its applications on an allegation that the export prices concerned were equal to or higher than those applicable under the arrangement mentioned in paragraph 2 above.
7. The applicant also alleged that a certain number of the shipments involved in its applications were of low quality cotton yarn and that therefore lower export prices should be allowed for these shipments.
8. In addition, the applicant objected to the fact that export prices were established on the basis of the prices at which the goods were sold by the Turkish exporters to intermediate buyers in a third country and not on the basis of the prices at which the goods were imported into the Community.
C. Admissibility
9. The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular the time limits.
D. Merits of the claim
10. In considering the validity of the applicant's applications, the Commission has used as normal values the arrangement prices (paragraph 2 above), with appropriate reductions for low quality cotton yarn applicable at the time the goods concerned were released into free circulation in the Community. For goods released until 28 August 1982 the original arrangement prices were used and for goods released after that date updated arrangement prices were used. The Commission took the date on which the goods were released into free circulation in the Community as the basis for deciding which of these two values (original or updated arrangement prices) was appropriate. It is on that date that the obligation to pay the duty is incurred and the importer becomes eligible to claim a refund and, consequently, it is the price applicable on that date that has to be taken into account.
11. For the goods released into free circulation up to 28 August 1982 the Commission considered the use of the original arrangement prices as normal values appropriate as these prices were equivalent to the normal values established by the Commission during its anti-dumping investigation in Turkey and, consequently, to those definitively determined in Regulation (EEC) No 789/82. The use of updated normal values for those goods released into free circulation after 28 August 1982 is also considered appropriate as the arrangement contained a provision for the updating of the arrangement prices in accordance with significant movements in the price of raw cotton in the 'A' index on the Liverpool Exchange as published in Cotton Outlook. This index monitors the prices of raw cotton in the major growing countries including Turkey and was considered by the Commission and the Turkish authorities and exporters as an accurate reflection of movements in the prices of raw cotton in Turkey. Therefore, the original arrangement prices were increased by 7,5 % with effect for goods released into free circulation after 28 August 1982. The revised prices were further revised downwards by 5,2 % with effect from 20 October 1982. In this respect it should be noted that each revision of the arrangement prices only took place after full consultations between the Commission and the Turkish authorities and exporters to obtain agreement that a significant change had occured in the abovementioned Liverpool Index and that the arrangement prices should be revised accordingly. Therefore for this refund claim the Commission updated the normal values in accordance with the changes in the arrangement prices.
12. The Commission has rejected the applicant's claim, mentioned in paragraph 8 above, that the appropriate prices to be compared with the normal values are those at which the goods were imported into the Community. This is because Article 2 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 states that for the purpose of a fair comparison the normal value and the export price shall be on a comparable basis and should be compared at the same level of trade, preferably at the ex-factory level. In this respect the prices at which the goods in question were imported into the Community include the costs and profit of an intermediate buyer in a third country and therefore cannot be compared with the normal values mentioned in paragraph 10 above, as these normal values are fob Turkey prices and do not include costs and profits of an intermediate buyer in a third country. To achieve the comparable basis required under the abovementioned Article the Commission considers that it is necessary to use the prices charged by the Turkish exporter to the intermediate buyer in the third country.
13. In considering the merits of these applications the Commission has disregarded claims with regard to shipments which were paid for by non-guaranteed trade arrears (debts owed by the Turkish State to foreign creditors) because the applicant failed to provide any information on the effects of this method of payment on the transactions concerned. The applicant did not contest this.
14. A comparison of the normal values mentioned in paragraph 11 above with the export prices mentioned in paragraph 12 above shows that the applicant's claim is only partly justified.
E. Amount of refund
15. The amount to be refunded should be equal to the amount by which the duty collected exceeded the difference between the normal values referred to in paragraph 11 above and the export prices referred to in paragraph 12 above. The total difference for the shipments in question amounts to . . . DM,","{'title': '85/515/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 November 1985 concerning applications submitted by Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG, Gronau, for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of cotton yarn originating in Turkey (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe refund applications submitted by Nellen & Quack GmbH & Co KG, Gronau, between 1 April 1982 and 31 August 1983 are hereby granted as to . . . .

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Commission adopted Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health (2). The list as established by Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 contains 222 permitted health claims, corresponding to 497 entries in the consolidated list (3) submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) for a scientific assessment.
(2) However, at the time of the adoption of the list of permitted health claims, there were a number of health claims whose evaluation by the Authority or consideration by the Commission was not finalised (4).
(3) For health claims on micro-organisms which, in its initial assessment, the Authority considered insufficiently characterised and health claims for which it concluded that ‘the evidence provided is insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship’, the Commission and Member States agreed that they would not be able to consider their inclusion or non-inclusion in the list of permitted claims unless a further assessment was carried out by the Authority. The Authority finalised its assessments on these health claims and published its opinions on 5 June and 7 August 2012 (5) concluding that, on the basis of the data submitted, a cause and effect relationship has been established between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and the claimed effect for two health claims (6).
(4) The Commission has finalised its consideration of all health claims submitted for evaluation except for four categories of claims made on specific groups of food or one of their constituents. Those categories include claims on plant or herbal substances, commonly known as ‘botanical substances’, claims on specific foodstuffs, namely foods for use in very low calorie diets and foods with reduced lactose content, claims on caffeine and a claim on carbohydrates.
(5) As regards botanical substances, Member States and stakeholders expressed concerns as regards the difference in consideration given to the evidence based on ‘traditional use’ on the one hand under Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 in relation to health claims and on the other hand under Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (7) concerning the use as traditional herbal medicinal products. Since the Commission considers that these concerns are relevant and require further reflection and consultation, a decision on claims relating to botanical substances (8) should only be taken once those steps have been completed.
(6) As regards the health claims referring to the effects of very low calorie diets (9) and foods with reduced lactose content (10), the current revision of the legislation on foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses (11) might have an impact on those health claims. In order to avoid potential inconsistencies with that legislation, a decision on the health claims referring to those foodstuffs should only be taken once that revision has been finalised.
(7) As regards the health claims referring to the effects of caffeine (12), Member States expressed concerns in relation to the safety of caffeine intake within different target groups of the population. Since the Commission considers that these concerns are relevant and require further scientific advice by the Authority, a decision on claims relating to caffeine should only be taken once that step has been completed.
(8) As regards the health claim referring to the beneficial effects of carbohydrates (13), some Member States raised concerns as to its authorisation, because they consider it being potentially confusing to the consumer, particularly in light of national dietary advice to reduce sugars consumption. Since the Commission considers that, for this specific claim, conflicting objectives need to be reconciled, further analysis will be required for setting conditions of use for that claim. Therefore, a decision on the claim relating to carbohydrates should only be taken once this analysis has been completed.
(9) In order to ensure transparency and legal security for all interested parties, claims the consideration of which has not yet been completed will remain published on the website of the Commission (14) and may continue to be used pursuant to paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006.
(10) Health claims corresponding to the conclusions of the Authority that a cause and effect relationship has been established between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and the claimed effect and which comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 should be authorised under Article 13(3) of that Regulation, and included in the list of permitted claims established by Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 (15).
(11) Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that permitted health claims must be accompanied with all necessary conditions (including restrictions) for their use. Accordingly, the list of permitted claims should include the wording of the claims and specific conditions of use of the claims, and where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinions of the Authority.
(12) Pursuant to Article 6(1) and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 health claims need to be based on generally accepted scientific evidence. Accordingly, health claims that did not receive a favourable assessment on their scientific substantiation by the Authority, during either the initial assessment or during the ‘further assessment’ process, should not be authorised.
(13) Authorisation may also legitimately be withheld if health claims do not comply with other general and specific requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, even in the case of a favourable scientific assessment by the Authority. The Authority concluded that for one claim on the effect of L-arginine (16) on the maintenance of normal ammonia clearance and for another claim on the effect of L-tyrosine (17) on the normal synthesis of catecholamines a cause and effect relationship has been established. The Commission and the Member States have considered whether health claims reflecting those conclusions should be authorised. On the basis of the data submitted and of the current scientific knowledge, the Authority concluded that no conditions of use can be defined which would accompany the health claim on L-arginine (18), while for the health claim on L-tyrosine, the Authority proposed as appropriate conditions of use that ‘a food should be at least a source of protein as per Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006’ (19). In the Authority’s response of 9 November 2012 to the request of the Commission for clarification, the Authority noted that its conclusions for those claims were based on the known biochemical role of the two amino acids, as contained in protein. It added that it could not provide a quantitative indication of the necessary daily intake of L-tyrosine and L-arginine per se to produce the respective beneficial physiological effects. Accordingly, it is not possible to establish specific conditions for the use of those claims to ensure that the amino acids are contained in the final product in a quantity that will produce the respective beneficial physiological effects in accordance with point (i) of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006. In the absence of such specific conditions of use the beneficial effect of the substance to which the claim relates cannot be assured. Therefore, those claims could be misleading the consumer and should not be included in the lists of permitted health claims.
(14) This Regulation should apply six months after the date of its entry into force to enable food business operators to adapt to its requirements, including the prohibition according to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of those health claims whose evaluation by the Authority and whose consideration by the Commission has been completed.
(15) In line with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Register of nutrition and health claims containing all authorised health claims and those rejected and the reasons for their rejection should be updated in the light of the present Regulation and its deferred application.
(16) Comments and positions from the members of the public and interested stakeholders, received by the Commission have been adequately considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.
(17) Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(18) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '12.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 160/4', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 536/2013\nof 11 June 2013\namending Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Commission adopted Regulation (EU) No 432/2012 of 16 May 2012 establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children’s development and health(2).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 61, first subparagraph, point (d) in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 61, first subparagraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 7 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.
(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.
(3) For certain Community producers of sugar and isoglucose, exports from the Community represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Community. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the Community producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets.
(4) For the 2008/09 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit at 650 000 tonnes, in white sugar equivalent, for out-of-quota sugar exports and 50 000 tonnes, in dry matter, for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand.
(5) Community exports to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Community products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favorable competitive position. Furthermore, in order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or reintroduction into the Community of out-of-quota sugar or isoglucose certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations.
(6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product, those countries of the Western Balkans whose authorities have to issue an export certificate for the confirmation of the origin of the sugar or isoglucose products to be exported to the Community, should be exempted from this exclusion.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) (the basic Regulation), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98(2), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 449/2000(3), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand, but imposed no duties on imports originating in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia because their market shares were found to be de minimis, and accepted the price undertaking offered by the exporting producer in the Czech Republic.
(2) Following the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures, the Commission continued the investigation of dumping, injury and Community interest. The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(4) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.
(3) The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to imports originating in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.
B UNDERTAKINGS
(4) Following the adoption of provisional anti-dumping measures, the only cooperating exporting producer in the Republic of Korea and one of the cooperating exporting producers in Thailand, offered acceptable price undertakings (within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the Basic Regulation).
(5) According to those undertakings, the exporting producers in question have offered to sell to their unrelated customers at minimum prices.
(6) The Commission considers that the undertakings offered by the exporting producers concerned can be accepted since they eliminate the injurious effect of the dumping by means of minimum prices established for each product type and an ad valorem duty for the types which were not exported to the Community during the investigation period. Moreover, the regular and detailed reports of their sales which the companies have undertaken to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring. Furthermore, the sales structure of these exporting producers is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the agreed undertakings is limited.
(7) In order to ensure observance of the undertakings and their effective monitoring, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertakings is presented, exemption from duty is conditional upon presentation to the relevant Member States' customs' sevices of valid ""undertaking invoice"" issued by the exporting producers from whom the undertaking is accepted and containing the information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1784/2000. Where no such invoice is presented or when it does not correspondent to the product presented to the customs' services, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall be payable in order to avoid circumvention of the undertakings.
(8) In the event of a breach, or withdrawal of the undertakings, or if there are reasons to believe that the undertakings have been breached, a provisional or definitive anti-dumping duty may be imposed pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation.
C TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(9) As regards Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the volumes of imports originating in those countries were considered negligible in accordance with Articles 9(3) and 5(7) of the basic Regulation. Accordingly, the proceeding should be terminated with respect to imports originating in these two countries,","{'title': ""2000/523/EC: Commission Decision of 10 August 2000 accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand and terminating the proceeding in respect of imports originating in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (notified under document number C(2000) 2452)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe undertakings offered by the producers listed below, in the context of the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil, Croatia, the Czech Republic, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand are hereby accepted.\n\n>TABLE>""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is herby terminated.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 August 2000.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 128, 30.4.1998, p. 18.\n\n(3) OJ L 55, 29.2.2000, p. 3.\n\n(4) See page 8 of this Official Journal.'}]}"

COUNCIL DECISION
of 13 July 2010
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Bulgaria
(2010/422/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(6) in conjunction with Article 126(13) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Bulgaria,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provision of the said Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 126(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 126(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 126(4), the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in Bulgaria. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Bulgaria on 6 July 2010 (3).
(6) Article 126(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Bulgaria, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(7) According to the data notified by the Bulgarian authorities in April 2010, the general government deficit in Bulgaria reached 3,9 % of GDP in 2009, thus exceeding the 3 % of GDP reference value. The deficit was not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value but the excess over the reference value can be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it results from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, as the global economic and financial crisis hit hard the economy of Bulgaria and the negative annual GDP volume growth reached 5 % in 2009. According to the Commission services’ spring 2010 forecast, the general government deficit would fall below the reference value already in 2010 with the stabilisation of the economy and as a result of the fiscal consolidation measures undertaken by the government. However, on the basis of the revised deficit target for 2010 (3,8 % of GDP according to the notification of 22 June 2010 by the Bulgarian authorities), significantly above the Commission services’ spring forecast of 2,8 % of GDP, the breach of the reference value may not remain temporary. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) According to the data notified by the Bulgarian authorities in April 2010, the general government gross debt remains well below the 60 % of GDP reference value and stood at 14,8 % of GDP in 2009. The Commission services’ spring 2010 forecast projects the debt ratio to increase over the 2010-2011 period, but to remain below 19 % of GDP. In a notification submitted on 22 June 2010, the Bulgarian authorities further revised the planned debt for 2010 to 15,3 % of GDP. The debt criterion in the Treaty is fulfilled.
(9) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Bulgaria, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '31.7.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 199/26', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 13 July 2010\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Bulgaria\n(2010/422/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 of 29 April 2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine, amending Regulations (EC) No 1493/1999, (EC) No 1782/2003, (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 3/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2392/86 and (EC) No 1493/1999 (2) introduces in particular support for restructuring and conversion, green harvesting and grubbing up in the wine sector. At the same time it establishes that farmers receiving payment under those measures have to comply with cross-compliance obligations referred to in Articles 3 to 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Therefore, the detailed rules concerning the implementation of cross-compliance provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 (3) should apply to those farmers. Consequently, the title of that Regulation should be amended.
(2) Articles 20 and 103 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 introduce cross-compliance obligations for support in the wine sector which should apply during a defined period from payment. The starting point of these obligations should be clarified.
(3) For the application of cross-compliance obligations, the farmer should declare all area on the holding. Hence, farmers who only apply for support measures covered by cross-compliance pursuant to Articles 20 and 103 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 and no other direct payments should be obliged to declare on a yearly basis all their agricultural area of the holding in a single application form, unless the competent authorities are already disposing of this information.
(4) The existing provisions for farmers receiving direct payments concerning non-declaration of all the agricultural areas and delayed submission of applications do not apply to farmers claiming for support measures under the wine reform. There is a need to implement provisions which would lead farmers claiming for support measures under the wine reform to submit a single application form and to declare all their agricultural areas. Hence, if a beneficiary under the wine reform ignores the provision to submit a single application form or does not declare all his agricultural areas, the payments should be reduced.
(5) The minimum control rate for the respect of cross-compliance obligations should be established for farmers subject to cross-compliance in the wine sector according to Articles 20 and 103 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008. Following the current rules under cross-compliance, that control rate should be fixed at 1 % of farmers concerned.
(6) The selection of the control sample for cross-compliance obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 796/2004, with regard to the application of Articles 20 and 103 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 should, to ensure an appropriate control, be made from the population of farmers subject to the said Articles.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 clarifies the rules on liability under cross-compliance particularly in the case of transfer of land during the calendar year concerned. Those rules should also apply to the farmer who submits an application for support pursuant to Articles 11, 12 and 98 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008, on a yearly basis.
(8) The rules for reductions in the case of non-compliance should also apply to payments as defined in Articles 11, 12 and 98 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 in the calendar year of the finding. In the case where the support measures for the wine sector are not granted on a yearly basis, a specific provision for the calculation of the amount to be reduced should be provided for. This should take into account the number of years in which the cross-compliance obligations apply.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 44(2)(g) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for the adoption of measures of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, inter alia by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument with new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (5) concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) The Commission should be empowered to adopt measures necessary for the implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC, in particular to ensure confidence in the audit function and the uniform application of requirements regarding professional ethics, quality-assurance systems, independence and objectivity, to adapt the list of subjects to be included in the test of theoretical knowledge for auditors, to adopt international auditing standards and common standards for audit reports for annual or consolidated accounts, and to define exceptional cases of direct transfer of documents to third countries. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2006/43/EC, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) Directive 2006/43/EC provides for a time restriction concerning the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their statement concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament's wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the codecision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time limit. The European Parliament and the Council also declared that they would ensure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that prescribe a time limit for the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the provision establishing that time restriction in Directive 2006/43/EC should be deleted.
(6) The Commission should, at regular intervals, evaluate the functioning of the provisions concerning the implementing powers conferred on it in order to allow the European Parliament and the Council to determine whether the extent of those powers and the procedural requirements imposed on the Commission are appropriate and ensure both efficiency and democratic accountability.
(7) Directive 2006/43/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes chlorate.
(3) For chlorate the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For chlorate the rapporteur Member State was France and all relevant information was submitted on 26 July 2007.
(4) The Commission examined chlorate in accordance with Article 11a of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. A draft review report for that substance was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 July 2008 in the format of the Commission review report.
(5) During the examination of this active substance by the Committee, it was concluded, taking into account comments received from Member States, that there are clear indications that it may be expected that it has harmful effects on human health, in particular taking into consideration the unacceptable exposure to operators taking into account the proposed provisional AOEL. In addition, information was insufficient to establish a definitive AOEL and to assess the leaching of a relevant metabolite to groundwater. Moreover, other concerns which were identified by the rapporteur Member States in its assessment report are included in the review report for the substance.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the examination of chlorate and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forwards by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing chlorate satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Chlorate should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing chlorate are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing chlorate should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing chlorate remain available for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for chlorate in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (4), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '18.11.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 307/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 10 November 2008\nconcerning the non-inclusion of chlorate in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document number C(2008) 6587)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/865/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

However, despite the arguments put forwards by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing chlorate satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((7)) Chlorate should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((8)) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing chlorate are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n\n((9)) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing chlorate should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing chlorate remain available for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.\n\n((10)) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for chlorate in accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I(4), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nChlorate shall not be included as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall ensure that:\n(a)\nauthorisations for plant protection products containing chlorate are withdrawn by 10 May 2009;\n(b)\nno authorisations for plant protection products containing chlorate are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nAny period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 10 May 2010 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) To carry out the tasks entrusted to them, in the context of the Community air transport policy and that of the future development of the Common Transport Policy, the Community institutions should have at their disposal comparable, consistent, synchronised and regular statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air within the Community or to and from the Community.
(2) There are currently no such comprehensive Community-wide statistics.
(3) Council Decision 1999/126/EC of 22 December 1998 on the Community statistical programme 1998 to 2002(4) has identified the need to establish such statistics.
(4) The common data collection on a comparable or harmonised basis makes possible the provision of an integrated system with reliable, consistent and prompt information.
(5) The data for the carriage of passengers, freight and mail by air should, where possible, be compatible with international data provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and be made comparable, where applicable, as between Member States and for the different modes of transport.
(6) After a certain period, the Commission should submit a report in order to allow an assessment of the application of this Regulation to be made.
(7) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity laid down in Article 5 of the Treaty, the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data is an action which can only be undertaken efficiently at Community level. Such standards should be implemented in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of producing official statistics.
(8) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(5) provides a reference framework for the provisions laid down by this Regulation.
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(10) The Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(7) has been consulted.

Whereas:
(1) The Member States may obtain the status of approved farm free of infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) and viral haermorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) for fish farms located in zones which are non-approved in respect of IHN and VHS.

of 13 December 1990
opening and  providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products  originating in Israel (1991)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Articles 1 and 2 of the Fourth Additional Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement between the  European Economic Community and the State of Israel (1) provide for the opening of Community tariff  quotas for the import into the Community of:
- 17 000 tonnes of new potatoes, falling within CN code ex 0701 90 51 (1 January to 31 March),
- 3 100 tonnes of carrots, falling within CN code ex 0706 10 00 (1 January to 31 March),
- 7 400 tonnes of sweet peppers and peppers, falling within CN code 0709 60 10,
- 10 800 tonnes of celery sticks, falling within CN code ex 0709 40 00 (1 January to 30 April),
- 293 000 tonnes of fresh oranges, falling within CN code ex 0805 10 (1 July to 30 June),
- 14 200 tonnes of fresh mandarins, clementines, etc, falling within CN code ex 0805 20 (1 July to  30 June),
- 6 400 tonnes of fresh lemons, falling within CN code ex 0805 30 10,
- 7 800 tonnes of watermelons, falling within CN code 0807 10 10 (1 April to 15 June),
- 9 500 tonnes of melons, falling within CN code ex 0807 10 90 (1 November to 31 May),
- 2 800 tonnes of peeled tomatoes, falling within CN code 2002 10 10,
- 150 tonnes of apricot pulp, falling within CN code 2008 50 91,
- 82 700 tonnes of orange juice, falling within CN codes 2009 11 11;19 and 2009 19 11;19;91;99, of  which not more than 20 000 tonnes may be imported in packings of a capacity of two litres or less,
- 8 500 tonnes of tomato juice, falling within CN codes 2009 50 10 and 2009 50 90,
originating in Israel;
Whereas, by virtue of the provisions of a common declaration of the Contracting Parties forming an  integral part of the said Protocol, the accounting of the quantities of fresh oranges and of fresh  mandarins, clementines, etc. in question must begin on 1 July each year; whereas, to keep this  arrangement, it is fitting to open the quota in question for the period 1 January to 30 June 1991  with the consequence that the quotas by applying the pro rata clause, must be fixed respectively at  146 500 tonnes and 7 100 tonnes;
Whereas, furthermore, tariff dismantling for melons will begin only on 1 January 1991, namely two  months after the beginning of the quota period; whereas therefore it is appropriate to open the  tariff quota in question for an amount which, based on the pro rata clause, should be set at 6 785  tonnes;
Whereas, within the limits of these tariff quotas, customs duties are to be phased out according to  the same timetables and at the same rates as laid down in Articles 75, 243 and 268 of the Act of  Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas, however, within the limits of these tariff quotas, Spain  and Portugal shall apply customs duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of  Council Regulation (EEC) N° 4162/87 of 21 December 1987 laying down arrangements for Spain's and  Portugal's trade with Israel (2); whereas the Community tariff quotas in question should therefore  be opened for 1991;
Whereas, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2573/90 of 5 September 1990 totally suspending  certain customs duties applicable by the Community of Ten to imports from Spain and Portugal (3),  the said duties are, as concerns the products referred to in Annex II to the Treaty, totally  suspended once they reach a level of 2 % or less; whereas the same rate of duty should be applied  to imports of the same products originating in Israel;
Whereas all Community importers should be ensured equal and continuous access to the said quotas  and the duty rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the  products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted; whereas the necessary  measures should be taken to provide for effective Community management of the quotas, so that the  Member States may draw against the quotas such quantities as they
may need, corresponding to  actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member  States and the Commission;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of these quotas may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/90 of 13 December 1990 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in Israel (1991)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe customs duties applicable to imports  into the Community of the products listed below originating in Israel shall be suspended during the  periods, at the levels and within the limits of the Community tariff quotas shown below:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nWithin the limits of these tariff quotas the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese  Republic shall apply customs duties calculated in accordance with the relevant provisions of  Regulation (EEC) No 4162/87.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Article 1 shall be  managed\n\nby the Commission, which may take all appropriate administrative measures in order to  ensure efficient management thereof.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nWhere an importer enters a product covered by this  Regulation under a declaration for free circulation in a Member State and applies to take advantage  of the preferential arrangements and that declaration is accepted by the customs authorities the  Member State concerned shall, by notifying the Commission, draw an amount corresponding to its  requirements from the quota volume.\n\nRequests for drawings, indicating the date of acceptance of the said declarations, must be sent to  the Commission without delay.\n\nThe drawings shall be granted by the Commission by reference to the date of acceptance of the  declaration of entry for free circulation, to the extent that the available balance so permits.\n\nIf a Member State does not use the quantities drawn it shall return them to the corresponding quota  volume as soon as possible.\n\nIf the quantities requested are greater than the available balance of the quota volume, the balance  shall be allocated among applications pro rata.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);

Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), and in particular Article 247 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (2), and in particular Article 89(1)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 (3) applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 1 January 2009, the Union granted generalised tariff preferences to El Salvador.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 establishes the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purpose of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP). Article 89 of that Regulation provides for a derogation from that definition in favour of beneficiary countries benefiting from GSP.
(3) By letter dated 30 March 2012, El Salvador submitted a request for a derogation from the GSP rules of origin in accordance with Article 89 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. By letters dated 20 June 2012 and 30 July 2012, El Salvador submitted additional information in support of this request.
(4) The request concerns a total annual quantity of 4 000 tonnes of cooked, frozen and vacuum-packed tuna fillets known as ‘loins’ (hereafter ‘tuna loins’) of CN code 1604 14 16 for a period from 1 July until 31 December 2012.
(5) The request demonstrates that, without the derogation, the ability of the Salvadorian fish processing industry to continue to export tuna loins eligible for preferential tariff treatment to the Union would be significantly affected.
(6) The derogation is therefore required in order to give El Salvador sufficient time to prepare its fish processing industry to comply with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin of tuna loins. This sufficient time is needed in order to secure adequate flows of originating tuna to the country by the government and the processing industries of El Salvador.
(7) Given the existing supply flows and production patterns, the derogation should be granted in respect of yearly quantities of 1 975 tonnes for tuna loins of CN code ex 1604 14 16. In order to ensure that the temporary derogation be limited to the time needed for El Salvador to achieve compliance with the rules for the acquisition of preferential origin of tuna loins, the derogation should be granted from 1 January 2012 until 30 June 2013. The quota amount for 2013 should be defined on a pro rata basis to the period of the derogation granted. Consequently, the quota amounts should be set out at 1 975 tonnes for 2012, and 987,5 tonnes for 2013.
(8) In order to ensure the continuity of exports of the processed fish eligible for preferential tariff treatment from El Salvador to the Union, the derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 January 2012.
(9) For the sake of clarity and in order for tuna loins of CN code ex 1604 14 16 to benefit from the derogation, it is appropriate to set out explicitly that the only non-originating materials to be used for the manufacture of the said tuna loins should be tuna of HS headings 0302 or 0303.
(10) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 lays down rules relating to the management of tariff quotas. In order to ensure efficient management conducted in close cooperation between the authorities of El Salvador, the customs authorities of the Union and the Commission, those rules should apply mutatis mutandis to the quantities imported under the derogation granted by this Regulation.
(11) In order to allow efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation, it is necessary to lay down the obligation for the authorities of El Salvador to communicate regularly to the Commission details of the certificates of origin Form A which have been issued.

","COUNCIL DECISION
of 22 April 1999
regarding a Community procedure for information and consultation on crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products
(1999/280/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
(1) Whereas transparency of consumer prices of petroleum products and information about crude oil supply costs are necessary for the satisfactory operation of the internal market, and particularly for the free movement of goods within the Community;
(2) Whereas Council Directive 76/491/EEC of 4 May 1976 regarding a Community procedure for information and consultation on the prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the Community(4) requires Member States to communicate to the Commission information which no longer reflects the conditions prevailing on the oil markets; whereas Directive 76/491/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Community information procedure;
(3) Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 2964/95 of 20 December 1995 introducing registration for crude oil imports and deliveries in the Community(5) enables the Commission to be informed, in respect of each Member State, of the monthly supply cost by type of crude oil as regards imports from third countries or deliveries from another Member State but does not enable it to determine the overall crude oil supply cost in the Community;
(4) Whereas it is therefore desirable to set up a Community procedure for information and consultation on crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products;
(5) Whereas this procedure requires the acquisition, at regular intervals, of certain information from Member States regarding crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products in aggregate form;
(6) Whereas, in accordance with their current practice, Member States should continue to communicate to the Commission the consumer prices of petroleum products each Monday as they have done in the past on a voluntary basis; whereas Member States may maintain their current system or create new procedures to collect the data;
(7) Whereas the information collected should make it possible to make a comparison of the trend in costs and oil prices charged in the Community;
(8) Whereas the taxes charged on petroleum products are a component of the selling price, and it is therefore necessary, in order to ensure the transparency of the prices of those products and make a comparison of the prices charged in the Community, to indicate the consumer prices of petroleum products net of duties and taxes and inclusive of all taxes;
(9) Whereas the information collected and the results of the analyses carried out by the Commission should be published at Community level in order to ensure market transparency and should be the subject of consultation between the Member States and the Commission;
(10) Whereas, should the Commission find anomalies or inconsistencies in the figures communicated to it, it should be able to obtain further information from the Member State concerned;
(11) Whereas the precise arrangements concerning the communications to be made need to be specified in more detail,","{'title': '1999/280/EC: Council Decision of 22 April 1999 regarding a Community procedure for information and consultation on crude oil supply costs and the consumer prices of petroleum products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe Member States shall communicate to the Commission information relating to the curde oil supply cost cif and the consumer prices of petroleum products, in the manner laid down in Article 3.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 950 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001(5), should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1144/2002 of 27 June 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWith the exception of the quantity of 950 tonnes provided for in the Annex, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 28 June 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 June 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(2) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(3) OJ L 154, 15.6.1976, p. 11.\n\n(4) OJ L 117, 24.5.1995, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ L 308, 27.11.2001, p. 16.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 27 June 2002 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\n\nR01 Switzerland, Liechtenstein, communes of Livigno and Campione d\'Italia.\n\nR02 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Ex-Spanish Sahara, Cyprus, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, West Bank/Gaza Strip, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine, Kazakstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nR03 Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Bermuda, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, A40, A11 except Suriname, Guyana, Madagascar.'}]}"

","COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 95/57/EC of 23 November 1995 on the  collection of statistical information in the field of tourism
THE COUNCIL OF THE  EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Resolutions of the European Parliament of 11 June 1991  (1) and 18 January 1994  (2)  stress that the Community has a major role to play in developing tourism statistics;
Whereas the elaboration of a Directive aimed at channelling efforts currently expended in a  fragmented manner at national level has been approved by the Economic and Social Committee  (3);
Whereas, under Decision 90/655/EEC  (4), a Community methodological framework for the compilation  of Community tourism statistics has been developed;
Whereas the results of the two-year programme (1991-1992) for developing Community tourism  statistics under Decision 90/655/EEC highlight the needs of users in the private and public sector  for reliable and comparable statistics on tourism demand and supply at Community level available at  short notice;
Whereas the development of Community statistics on tourism was recognized as a priority by Council  Decision 92/421/EEC of 13 July 1992 on a Community action plan to assist tourism  (5);
Whereas the recognized role of tourism as a tool of development and socioeconomic integration can  be better ensured through knowledge of the basic related statistics, notably established at  regional level;
Whereas, in order to assess the competitiveness of the Community tourist industry, it is necessary  to gain greater knowledge of the volume of tourism, the characteristics thereof, the profile of the  tourist and tourist expenditure;
Whereas monthly information is required to be able to measure the seasonal influences of demand on  tourist accomodation capacity and thereby to assist public authorities and economic operators to  develop more suitable strategies and policies for improving the seasonal spread of holidays and the  performance of tourist activities;
Whereas further Community activity in this field must continue to be based on a pragmatic approach  which is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity;
Whereas the necessary synergies between national, international and Community statistical projects  impinging on tourism must be ensured in order to reduce the onus of collecting information;
Whereas methodological work developed in cooperation with other international organizations, such  as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Tourism Organization,  and the Recommendations adopted by the Statistical Commission of the United Nations in March 1993  should be taken into account in order to ensure better comparability of tourism statistics at world  level;
Whereas reliable and efficient monitoring of the structure and evolution of tourism demand and  supply can be significantly improved by establishing an appropriate recognized Community  framework;
Whereas such a system may generate economies of scale, while producing information benefiting all  Member States and parties concerned;
Whereas a Community instrument could facilitate the dissemination of comparable tourism  statistics;
Whereas Council Decision 93/464/EEC of 22 July 1993 on the framework programme for priority actions  in the field of statistical information, 1993 to 1997  (6) provides for the setting-up of an  information system on tourism supply and demand;
Whereas a Council Directive can provide a common framework to maximize the benefits of the various  actions which are being carried out at national level;
Whereas the statistical data compiled under a Community system must be reliable and appropriate to  ensure comparability between Member States; whereas it is therefore necessary to establish jointly  the criteria enabling these requirements to be met,","{'title': 'Council Directive 95/57/EC of 23 November 1995 on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAim\n\nFor the purpose of establishing an information system on  tourism statistics at Community level, Member States shall carry out the collection, compilation,  processing and transmission of harmonized Community statistical information on tourism supply and  demand.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nDomain of information collection and basic definitions\n\nFor the purposes of this  Directive, the data to be collected shall relate to:\n\n(a)  the capacity of collective tourist accommodation establishments The types of collective accommodation in question are as follows:\n\n1.  hotels and similar establishments 2.  other collective accommodation establishments, inter alia:\n\n2.1.  tourist campsites 2.2.  holiday dwellings 2.3.  other collective accommodation;\n\n(b)  guest flows in collective accommodation establishments:\n\nThe collection shall cover internal tourism, i.e. domestic and inbound tourism; 'domestic tourism`  shall mean residents of the given country travelling only within this country and 'inbound tourism`  shall mean non-residents travelling within the given country;\n\n(c)  tourism demand:\n\nThe collection shall cover national tourism, i.e. domestic and outbound tourism; 'outbound tourism`  shall mean residents of a country travelling in another country.

Whereas:
(1) The Commission consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal.
(2) Decision 2002/882/EC(2) provides for further macro-financial assistance to be made available to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with a view to ensuring a sustainable balance of payments situation and strengthening the country's reserve position.
(3) On 4 February 2003, there was a constitutional change and the country is now called Serbia and Montenegro.
(4) Following the assassination of the Serbian Prime Minister on 11 March 2003, the external outlook of the country appears to be more uncertain, in particular with respect to the size of private capital inflows, including foreign direct investments, while important financing needs continue to put a heavy strain on the economy.
(5) Additional balance of payments needs in 2003 and possibly in 2004 have been identified in the context of the current IMF programme and Serbia and Montenegro will require significant additional external financing in 2003 and possibly in 2004 over and above official financing which could be provided by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other donors, including the Community.
(6) An increase in Community macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro is an appropriate measure to help, with other donors, ease the country's financial constraints.
(7) The grant component of this assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority and its implementation will be subject to the availability of appropriations under the corresponding budget heading.
(8) The increase of macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro should not be to the detriment of foreseen macro-financial assistance for other countries covered by the same budget heading.
(9) The Treaty provides for no powers, other than those in Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Decision,","{'title': '2003/825/EC: Council Decision of 25 November 2003 amending Decision 2002/882/EC providing further macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with regard to additional macro-financial assistance to Serbia and Montenegro', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 2002/882/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

amending Council Decision 2008/971/EC to include forest reproductive material of the ‘qualified’ category and to update the name of the authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2008/971/EC of 16 December 2008 on the equivalence of forest reproductive material produced in third countries (3) determines the conditions under which forest reproductive material of the ‘source identified’ and ‘selected’ categories, produced in third countries listed in Annex I to that Decision, is to be imported into the Union.
(2) The national rules for the certification of forest reproductive material in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States provide for an official field inspection to be carried out during the collection and processing of seed and the production of planting stock.
(3) According to those rules, the systems for the approval and registration of basic material and the subsequent production of reproductive material from that basic material should follow the OECD Scheme for the Certification of Forest Reproductive Material Moving in International Trade (OECD Forest Seed and Plant Scheme). In addition, those rules require seed and planting stock of the ‘source identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ categories to be officially certified and the seed packages to be officially closed in accordance with the OECD Forest Seed and Plant Scheme.
(4) An examination of those rules as regards the ‘qualified’ category has shown that the conditions for approval of basic material satisfy the requirements laid down in Council Directive 1999/105/EC of 22 December 1999 on the marketing of forest reproductive material (4). Furthermore, with the exception of the conditions regarding seed quality, species purity and planting stock quality, the rules of these third countries afford the same guarantees as regards the conditions applicable to seed and planting stock of the new ‘qualified’ category as those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC. It follows that the rules relating to the certification of forestry material of the ‘qualified’ category in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States should be considered to be equivalent to those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC, provided that the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2008/971/EC are satisfied as regards seed and planting stocks.
(5) As regards material of the ‘qualified’ category, those conditions should include the provision of information on whether the products have been genetically modified or not. Such information should facilitate the application of the requirements set out in Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (5), or, where applicable, in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (6) and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms (7).
(6) In addition, the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production, as listed in Annex I to Decision 2008/971/EC, have changed.

It follows that the rules relating to the certification of forestry material of the ‘qualified’ category in Canada, Croatia, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States should be considered to be equivalent to those set out in Directive 1999/105/EC, provided that the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2008/971/EC are satisfied as regards seed and planting stocks.\n\n((5)) As regards material of the ‘qualified’ category, those conditions should include the provision of information on whether the products have been genetically modified or not. Such information should facilitate the application of the requirements set out in Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms(5), or, where applicable, in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed(6)and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms(7).\n\n((6)) In addition, the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production, as listed in Annex I to Decision 2008/971/EC, have changed.\n\n((7)) Decision 2008/971/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2008/971/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 1, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n‘This Decision determines the conditions under which forest reproductive material of the ‘source identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ categories produced in a third country listed in Annex I shall be imported into the Union.’;\n(2)\nin Article 3, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Seed and planting stock of the ‘source identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ categories of species listed in Annex I to Directive 1999/105/EC, produced in the third countries listed in Annex I to this Decision and officially certified by the third country authorities listed in that Annex, shall be considered equivalent to seed and planting stock complying with Directive 1999/105/EC, provided that the conditions laid down in Annex II to this Decision are satisfied.’;\n(3)\nin Article 4, the first paragraph is replaced by the following:\n‘When seed and planting stock enter the Union, the supplier importing this material shall inform the official body of that Member State in advance of the import.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/68/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes mecoprop, mecoprop-P and propiconazole.
(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), the following rapporteur Member States were designated, which in turn submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92: mecoprop: Rapporteur Member State Denmark, all relevant information was submitted on 31 August 1999; mecoprop-P: Rapporteur Member State Denmark, all relevant information was submitted on 7 January 1999; propiconazole: Rapporteur Member State Finland, all relevant information was submitted on 30 November 1998.
(3) Those assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.
(4) The reviews of all active substances were finalised on 15 April 2003 in the format of the Commission review reports for mecoprop, mecoprop-P and propiconazole.
(5) The reviews of mecoprop, mecoprop-P and propiconazole did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing mecoprop, mecoprop-P or propiconazole may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) The Commission review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide that the finalised review report, except for confidential information, should be kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(9) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing mecoprop, mecoprop-P or propiconazole, and in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by means of UN Security Council Resolutions 808 and 827 (1993), which are based on Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The ICTY has the power to prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The Security Council argued that the widespread and flagrant violations of humanitarian law occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia constituted a threat to international peace and security and that the establishment, as an ad hoc measure, of an international tribunal and the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law would contribute to the restoration and maintenance of peace.
(2) On 28 August 2003, UN Security Council Resolution 1503 (2003) called on the ICTY to complete all work in 2010 and on all States to intensify cooperation with and render all necessary assistance to the ICTY, particularly to bring all fugitive indictees to the ICTY.
(3) Common Position 2004/694/CFSP stipulates that certain funds and economic resources should be frozen in support of effective implementation of the mandate of the ICTY. These additional restrictive measures should be used so as to control all dealings with funds and economic resources owned by persons indicted by the ICTY who are still at large and to ban any support they might receive from within the Community.
(4) These measures fall within the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement these measures as far as the Community is concerned. For the purposes of this Regulation, the territory of the Community should be deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.
(5) For reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to amend the Annexes to this Regulation.
(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,
(7) The Treaty, in Articles 60 and 301, empowers the Council to take, under certain conditions, measures aimed at the interruption or reduction of payments or movement of capital and of economic relations with regard to third countries. The measures laid down in this Regulation, targeted at individual persons not directly linked to the government of a third country, are necessary to attain this objective of the Community and Article 308 of the Treaty empowers the Council to take such measures if no other specific powers are provided for in the Treaty,","{'header': '14.10.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 315/14', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1763/2004\nof 11 October 2004\nimposing certain restrictive measures in support of effective implementation of the mandate of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established by means of UN Security Council Resolutions 808 and 827 (1993), which are based on Chapter VII of the UN Charter.

concerning the authorisation of a preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 as a feed additive for cattle for fattening and amending Regulation (EC) No 492/2006 (holder of the authorisation Prosol SpA)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) A preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 492/2006 (3). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 was also authorised for 10 years for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2009 (4), for dairy cows and horses by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1119/2010 (5), and for weaned piglets by Commission Regulation (EU) No 170/2011 (6).
(4) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of that preparation as a feed additive for cattle for fattening, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 13 March 2013 (7) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and it has the potential to improve the final body weight, the feed to gain ratio and the average daily gain. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(7) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the provisions on Saccharomyces cerevisiae MUCL 39885 contained in Regulation (EC) No 492/2006 should be deleted. Regulation (EC) No 492/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '31.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 289/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1059/2013\nof 29 October 2013\nconcerning the authorisation of a preparation ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaeMUCL 39885 as a feed additive for cattle for fattening and amending Regulation (EC) No 492/2006 (holder of the authorisation Prosol SpA)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 64/432/EEC (3) applies to trade in bovine animals and swine within the Union. It provides that the competent authority in a Member State may introduce a system of surveillance networks. Those networks include a computer database which is to contain, as a minimum, a number of elements laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC, including the identification code of each animal.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals. It requires as a general rule that the two official means of identification allocated to an animal bear the same identification code. However, during the initial phase of adjustment to the use of electronic identifiers as an official means of identification, it could not be excluded that, in certain cases, technical limitations related to the configuration of an animal’s original identification code could prevent the reproduction of that code on an electronic identifier. This could occur where the characters forming an animal’s existing identification code prevent that code from being converted into an electronic format. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 provides for specific transitory derogations to allow the application of an electronic identifier also to those animals, provided that full traceability is ensured and that the animals can be identified individually, including the holding on which they were born. The possibility of using such electronic identifiers should be reflected in the list of elements of the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC.
(3) In the interest of consistency of Union legislation, the type of electronic identifier, if applied to the animals, should also be added to the list of elements to be included in the computer databases laid down in Directive 64/432/EEC.

(3) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) replaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval procedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.
(4) In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos 4, 6, 11, 13, 13-H, 19, 25, 34, 37, 43, 44, 48, 53, 70, 96, 98, 104, 105, 106, 107, 112, 113, 121, 128 need to be adapted.
(5) In order to harmonise the relevant safety provisions for the type-approval of motor vehicles, the new UN Global Technical Regulation on tyres should be adopted. Also, an amendment to Mutual Resolution No 1 needs to be adopted to reflect technical progress.

setting the actual production of olive oil and the unit amount of the production aid for the 2002/2003 marketing year
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down general rules on the granting of aid for the production of olive oil and of aid to olive oil producer organisations (2), and in particular Article 17a(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the unit production aid must be adjusted in each Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity referred to in paragraph 3 of that Article. With a view to assessing the extent of the overrun in Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal, account should be taken of the estimates for the production of table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent using the relevant coefficients referred to, in the case of Greece, in Commission Decision 2001/649/EC (3), in the case of Spain, in Commission Decision 2001/650/EC (4), in the case of France, in Commission Decision 2001/648/EC (5), in the case of Italy, in Commission Decision 2001/658/EC (6) and in the case of Portugal, in Commission Decision 2001/670/EC (7).
(2) Article 17a(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that, in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined. That amount must be set at a level that rules out any risk of undue payment to olive growers. The amount also applies to table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent. For the 2002/03 marketing year, the estimated production and the unit amount of the production aid that can be paid in advance were laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1794/2003 (8).
(3) In order to determine the actual production for which entitlement to aid is recognised, the individual Member States concerned must inform the Commission by no later than 15 May following each marketing year of the quantity on which the aid is payable in that Member State, in accordance with Article 14(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98 (9). According to that information, the quantity on which the aid is payable for the 2002/03 marketing year is 473 820 tonnes for Greece, 960 716 tonnes for Spain, 3 344 tonnes for France, 686 342 tonnes for Italy and 28 771 tonnes for Portugal.
(4) Confirmation by the Member States that aid is payable on those quantities implies that the controls referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 2261/84 and (EC) No 2366/98 have been carried out. However, setting actual production on the basis of information from the Member States on the quantities on which aid is payable does not prejudge the conclusions that may be drawn from verification of the accuracy of that information under the accounts clearance procedure.
(5) Taking account of the actual production figures, the unit amount of the production aid provided for in Article 5(1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC payable on the eligible quantities of actual production should also be set.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,","{'header': '16.7.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 244/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1299/2004\nof 15 July 2004\nsetting the actual production of olive oil and the unit amount of the production aid for the 2002/2003 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the unit production aid must be adjusted in each Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity referred to in paragraph 3 of that Article.

of 24 July 2008
laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, as regards interbranch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Articles 127 and 179 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2077/92 of 30 June 1992 concerning interbranch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector (2) is to be repealed from 1 July 2008 under Article 201(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation).
(2) Certain provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2077/92 have not been incorporated in Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. In order to enable the tobacco sector to continue to function properly and in the interest of clarity and rationalisation a new Regulation should be adopted laying down those provisions as well as the current implementing rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 86/93 of 19 January 1993 on detailed rules for the application of Council Regulations (EEC) No 2077/92 concerning inter-branch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector (3).
(3) Regulation (EEC) No 86/93 should therefore be repealed.
(4) Interbranch organisations established by individuals or groups, and representing a significant proportion of the various categories involved in production, processing and marketing in the tobacco sector are likely to contribute to better account being taken of the market situation and encourage changes in economic behaviour intended to improve knowledge and organisation of production, processing and marketing. Some of their activities may contribute to improvement of the market balance and therefore help to achieve the objectives laid down in Article 33 of the Treaty. The measures which may constitute such a contribution by the interbranch organisations should be defined.
(5) In view of the above, it is appropriate to grant specific recognition to bodies which can demonstrate their proven representativeness at regional, inter-regional or Community level and which take positive action in pursuit of the above mentioned objectives. Such recognition should be granted by the Member State or by the Commission, depending on the scope of the activities of the trade association.
(6) In order to support certain activities of interbranch organisations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organisation for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an interbranch organisation for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions. Non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities. This procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer.
(7) Other activities of the recognised interbranch organisations may be of general economic or technical interest for the tobacco sector and so be of benefit to all persons active in the branches in question, whether or not they are members of the organisation. In such cases it appears reasonable to make non-members liable to pay the subscriptions intended to cover the costs, other than administrative costs, arising directly from performance of the activities in question.
(8) In order to ensure correct operation of the scheme, there should be close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission. The latter should also have permanent monitoring powers, particularly as regards recognition of interbranch organisations operating at regional or inter-regional level and the agreements and concerted practices adopted by such organisations.
(9) For the information of the Member States and other interested parties there should be provision for publication, at least once a year , of a list of the organisations recognised during the previous year, a list of the organisations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules which have been extended with an indication of their scope.
(10) In order to be sufficiently representative for its region, an interbranch organisation must cover at least one-third of the quantities produced, processed or purchased by the members of each of the branches. Likewise, in order to avoid imbalances between regions it must meet this requirement in all of the regions in which it operates.
(11) It should be specified that trade in tobacco covers, in addition to the business of tobacco merchants, direct purchase of baled tobacco by its final users.
(12) Where the Commission is responsible for the recognition of an interbranch organisation, the information which the interbranch organisation must provide to the Commission should be specified.
(13) Withdrawal of recognition must in general be made effective from the time the requirements for recognition ceased to be met.
(14) It should be specified that the minimum degree of representation of interbranch organisations operating inter-regionally must be the same as that laid down for regional interbranch organisations.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '25.7.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 197/23', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 709/2008\nof 24 July 2008\nlaying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No\xa01234/2007, as regards interbranch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EEC) No\xa02077/92 of 30\xa0June 1992 concerning interbranch organisations and agreements in the tobacco sector(2)is to be repealed from 1\xa0July 2008 under Article\xa0201(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No\xa01234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation).\n\n((2)) Certain provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No\xa02077/92 have not been incorporated in Regulation (EC) No\xa01234/2007.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of  the market in beef and veal  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 424/95  (2), and in  particular Article 12 (1) and (4) thereof,
Whereas the Community has undertaken, pursuant to the Agreement on Agriculture concluded during the  Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, to open an annual tariff quota of 20  000 head at  a rate of duty of 6  % for bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of the  mottled Simmental breed and the Schwyz and Fribourg breeds and an annual tariff quota of 5  000  head at a rate of 4  % for cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of the grey,  brown, yellow and mottled Simmental breed and the Pinzgau breed; whereas Council Decision 95/136/EC  of 14 March 1995 relating to the conclusion of an Agreement between the European Community and  Austria pursuant to Article XXVIII of the GATT  (3) unbinds the quota of 20  000 head and replaces  it with a tariff quota of 5  000 head at the same rate of duty; whereas those quotas should  therefore be opened for the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 and detailed rules adopted for their  application;
Whereas there should be a guarantee in particular of equal and continuing access to the said quotas  for all interested traders within the Community and of uninterrupted application of the customs  duties laid down for those quotas to all imports of the animals in question until the quotas are  exhausted;
Whereas these arrangements are based on the allocation by the Commission of the quantities  available to traditional traders (first part) and traders involved in the cattle trade (second  part); whereas the first part should be allocated to traditional importers in proportion to the  number of animals imported under similar quotas between 1 July 1992 and 30 June 1995 and to  traditional importers in the new Member States; whereas, in order to prevent speculation and given  the end-use, only quantities of a certain size representative of trade with third countries should  be taken into account as reference quantities for the allocation of the second part; whereas, for  all traders from the new Member States, imported animals must be from countries which are third  countries for them at the time of import;
Whereas, subject to the provisions of this Regulation, Commision Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16  November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and  export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products  (4), as last amended by  Regulation (EC) No 1199/95  (5), is applicable;
Whereas implementation of the abovementioned Agreements requires a revision of the specific  detailed rules governing import licensing arrangements in the beef and veal sector, currently  provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80  (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No  1084/94  (7), before 1 July 1995; whereas, to prevent problems arising in the practical application  of the current quotas, that Regulation should not apply and this Regulation should include the  necessary detailed rules for the import licences required;
Whereas Article 82 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the  Community Customs Code  (8), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden,  provides for customs supervision of goods put into free circulation at a reduced rate of duty on  account of their end-use; whereas imported animals should be monitored for a certain period to  ensure they are not slaughtered; whereas, in order to ensure that the animals concerned are not  slaughtered, a security should be required;

amending Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 as regards the scheme for the storage of unprocessed dried grapes and unprocessed dried figs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 of 28 October on the common organisation of the markets in processed fruit and vegetable products (1), and in particular Article 9(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 introduces storage arrangements for unprocessed dried grapes and unprocessed dried figs during the final two months of the marketing years of those products. The arrangements consist of a system for approving the storage agencies and paying them storage aid and financial compensation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 (2) establishes the conditions which the storage agencies must meet in order to be approved, in particular as regards the steps they must take to ensure that the products are stored properly.
(2) The second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 establishes transitional measures for unprocessed dried figs applying until the end of the 2003/04 marketing year.
(3) Weather conditions during part of the 2004/05 marketing year were poor and fruit was unable to develop satisfactorily. As a result, some producers chose to harvest their fruit at a size slightly smaller than the standard but meeting the other quality conditions required for human consumption. In order to prevent those quantities being diverted to the production of fig paste, which would mean a substantial financial loss, it is necessary to extend the abovementioned transitional measures and provide for an additional minimum size for the 2004/05 marketing year.
(4) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 provides for the products held by storage agencies to be sold by tender procedure. The intended use for unprocessed dried figs is a specific industrial use to be specified in the tender notice by the competent authority. In view of the lack of economic interest engendered by that approach no tenders were submitted so the competent authorities should be given the opportunity to expand the range of possible uses of the products to be sold from storage by adding direct animal feed and use in composting and biodegrading processes.

The arrangements consist of a system for approving the storage agencies and paying them storage aid and financial compensation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999(2)establishes the conditions which the storage agencies must meet in order to be approved, in particular as regards the steps they must take to ensure that the products are stored properly.\n\n((2)) The second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 establishes transitional measures for unprocessed dried figs applying until the end of the 2003/04 marketing year.\n\n((3)) Weather conditions during part of the 2004/05 marketing year were poor and fruit was unable to develop satisfactorily. As a result, some producers chose to harvest their fruit at a size slightly smaller than the standard but meeting the other quality conditions required for human consumption. In order to prevent those quantities being diverted to the production of fig paste, which would mean a substantial financial loss, it is necessary to extend the abovementioned transitional measures and provide for an additional minimum size for the 2004/05 marketing year.\n\n((4)) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 provides for the products held by storage agencies to be sold by tender procedure. The intended use for unprocessed dried figs is a specific industrial use to be specified in the tender notice by the competent authority. In view of the lack of economic interest engendered by that approach no tenders were submitted so the competent authorities should be given the opportunity to expand the range of possible uses of the products to be sold from storage by adding direct animal feed and use in composting and biodegrading processes.\n\n((5)) It is necessary to establish the physical and documentary check procedures for these new uses both at the time of entry into storage and at the time of removal.\n\n((6)) Regulation (EC) No 1622/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((7)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Products Processed from Fruit and Vegetables,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1622/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nIn Article 2, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The products shall be delivered to the storage agencies in stackable plastic crates.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/82/EC(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(3), as last amended by Directive 2000/82/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(4), as last amended by Directive 2000/82/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/21/EC(6), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The new active substances, azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium were included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directives 1999/80/EC(7) and 2000/50/EC(8), respectively, for use as a pre-emergence herbicide on rice, and as a plant growth regulator respectively.
(2) The substances were included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC based on assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed uses.
(3) Prior to the inclusion of the substances in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, their use had been provisionally authorised in certain Member States in accordance with Article 8(1) of the Directive. Following inclusion of the substances in Annex I, those Member States authorised a number of plant protection products containing them in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive, and established provisional maximum residue levels as required by Article 4(1)(f). As required by the Directive, those levels, and the information on which they were based, have been notified to the Commission. This information together with data available from other sources has been reviewed and is sufficient to fix certain maximum residue levels (MRLS). Where no Community maximum residue level or provisional MRL exists, Member States must establish a national provisional maximum residue level in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of the Directive before the authorisation may be granted. In view of Article 5 of Directive 86/363/EEC, this also applies for provisional MRLs for animal products where commodities containing residues of an active substance may be expected to be used as animal feeds.
(4) At their inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the technical and scientific evaluations of azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium were finalised on 2 July 1999, and 16 June 2000, respectively in the Commission review reports for azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium. In these review reports the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for azimsulfuron was set at 0,1 mg/kg bw/day, and for prohexadione calcium at 0,2 mg/kg bw/day. The lifetime exposure of consumers of food products treated with azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(9) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants(10) on this methodology. It has been calculated that the maximum residue levels provided for in this Directive do not result in these ADIs being exceeded.
(5) Acute toxic effects requiring the setting of an acute reference dose were not noted during the evaluations and discussions that preceded the inclusion of azimsulfuron, and prohexadione calcium in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) To ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues in or on products for which no authorisations have been granted, it is prudent to set provisional maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination for all those products covered by Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. The setting at Community level of such provisional maximum residue levels does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional maximum residue levels for azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. Four years is considered a sufficient period of time during which to establish most further uses of azimsulfuron and prohexadione calcium. After that period these provisional maximum residue levels should become definitive.
(7) The measures provided for in this Directive were communicated to the World Trade Organisation and the comments received were taken into consideration. The possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the Commission on the basis of the submission of acceptable data.
(8) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.

Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Articles 89 (2) and 234 (2) thereof,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1254/89 of 3 May 1989 fixing, for the 1989/90 marketing year, inter alia certain sugar prices and the standard quality of beet (5) fixed the intervention price for white sugar at ECU 53,10 per 100 kilograms applicable for the non-deficit areas and that applicable for white sugar falling under quotas held in free stock on 30 June 1989 at 24.00 by those persons entitled to reimbursement of storage costs for those stocks pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 and disposed of during the period 1 July to 30 September 1989; whereas such an intervention price should also be fixed for those stocks in the other areas of the Community;
Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that derived intervention prices for white sugar are to be fixed for each of the deficit areas; whereas, for such fixing, it is appropriate that account be taken of the regional variations which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, might be expected to occur in the price of sugar under natural conditions of price formation on the market;
Whereas a deficit supply situation is to be foreseen in the areas of production in Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom;
Whereas Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that an intervention price for raw sugar shall be fixed; whereas such price should be established on the basis of the intervention price for white sugar; whereas a special intervention price should be fixed for stocks of raw sugar falling under quotas held in free stock on 30 June 1989 at 24.00 by those persons entitled to reimbursement of storage costs for those stocks pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 and disposed of during the period 1 July to 30 September 1989;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1254/89 fixed the basic price for beet at ECU 40,07 per tonne; whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the minimum price to be fixed for A beet shall be 98 % of the basic price of the beet and the minimum price to be fixed for B beet shall in principle be 68 % of the said basic price, without prejudice to Article 28 (5) of that Regulation;
Whereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the threshold price for white sugar shall be equal to the target price, plus costs, calculated at a flat rate, of transport from the Community area having the largest surplus to the most distant deficit consumption area in the Community, plus a flat-rate amount which takes into account the foreseeable storage levy; whereas, given the state of supplies within the Community, account should be taken of transport charges between the departments of northern France and Palermo;
Whereas the threshold price for raw sugar is to be derived from the threshold price for white sugar by reference to a processing margin and a standard yield;
Whereas the threshold price for molasses should be fixed in such a way that the receipts from sales of molasses may reach the level of receipts of undertakings taken into account in the fixing of basic prices for beet;
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 (6) provides that the amount of repayment in the context of the compensation for storage costs shall be fixed per month and per unit of weight, taking account of financing, insurance and specific storage costs;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (1), and in particular Articles 9(2) and 10(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 64/432/EEC lays down rules for trade within the Union in bovine animals. Article 9 thereof provides that where a Member State has a compulsory national control programme for one of the contagious diseases listed in Annex E(II) thereto, it may submit its programme to the Commission for approval. That list includes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is the description of the most prominent clinical signs of the infection with the bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV1). Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.
(2) In addition, Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC provides that where a Member State considers that its territory or part thereof is free from one of the diseases listed in Annex E(II) to that Directive, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission. That Article also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.
(3) Commission Decision 2004/558/EC (2) approves the programmes for the control and eradication of BHV1 presented by the Member States listed in Annex I thereto for the regions listed in that Annex and for which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC.
(4) In addition, Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC lists the regions of the Member States that are considered free of BHV1 and to which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC.
(5) All regions of Germany, with the exception of the Federal States of Bavaria and Thuringia, are currently listed in Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC. The Federal States of Bavaria and Thuringia are free of BHV1 and are therefore listed in Annex II to that Decision.
(6) Germany has now submitted to the Commission documentation supporting the request for the additional guarantees in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC for the Federal States of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg, Berlin and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to be considered free of BHV1.
(7) Following the evaluation of the supporting documentation submitted by that Member State, the Federal States of Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg, Berlin and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in Germany should no longer be listed in Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC, but instead be listed in Annex II thereto and the application of the additional guarantees in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC should be extended to them. Annexes I and II to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in Mayotte to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The requirements in the legislation of Mayotte on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular, the ""Direction des Services Vétérinaires (DSV) of the Direction de l'Agriculture et de la Forêt (DAF)"" belonging to the ""Ministère français de l'agriculture et de la pêche"", is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force.
(4) The DSV has provided official assurances regarding compliance with the standards for health controls and monitoring of fishery products as set out in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/493/EEC and regarding the fulfilment of hygienic requirements equivalent to those laid down by that Directive.
(5) It is appropriate to lay down detailed provisions concerning fishery products imported into the Community from Mayotte, in accordance with Directive 91/493/EEC.
(6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with Article 3(1)(a)(I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3). These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the DSV to the Commission.
(7) However, the Community inspection team was not able to verify the inspection capacity of the DSV as regards the freezer or factory vessels because at the time of the inspection the two proposed freezer vessels were registered under French flag and no factory vessel was proposed to be authorised. Therefore, the inclusion of new vessels in the list will require a new inspection visit on the spot by the Commission experts.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs(1), as last amended by Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 70/524/EEC provides that new uses of additives may be authorised following the review of an application made in accordance with Article 4 of the Directive.
(2) Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC provides that provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive may be given if the conditions of Article 3a(b) to (e) are satisfied and if it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that when used in animal nutrition it has one of the effects referred to in Article 2(a). Such provisional authorisations may be given for a period up to four years in the case of additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to Directive 70/524/EEC.
(3) The assessment of the dossier submitted in respect of the new use of the enzyme preparation described in Annex I shows that it satisfies those conditions and may therefore be authorised on a provisional basis for a four-year period.
(4) The assessment of this dossier also shown that certain precautions should be taken in order to avoid exposure of workers to these additives. Such protection should be assured by the application of Community legislation on the safety and health of workers at work.
(5) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion with regard to the safety of this enzyme preparation.
(6) The Chernobyl accident caused radioactive caesium fallout, which contaminated forage in certain regions of northern Europe. Due to the long physical half-life of radiocaesium, this fallout still affects animal production. This emergency situation still continues in particular in Norway. The substance listed in Annex II to this Regulation may be used to decontaminate affected forage. The competent authorities of Norway therefore supported a dossier, seeking an extension of the period of authorisation of this substance.
(7) This additive is intended to be used only in contaminated areas for a limited period of time. Under normal conditions there is no need for the use of this additive, however, it should be kept available in case of similar future accidents in the Community.
(8) As no adverse effects were detected during its national use at Member State level nor since the provisional authorisation which was given at Community level in 1996, all conditions in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC are met. Therefore a permanent authorisation of this additive belonging to the group of radionuclide binders listed in Annex II should be given.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (2), and in particular Article 17 (6) thereof,
Whereas Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 provides that a reference price for red wine and a reference price for white wine must be fixed annually; whereas these reference prices must be fixed on the basis of the guide price for the types of red and white table wine most representative of Community production plus the costs incurred in bringing Community wines to the same marketing stage as imported wines;
Whereas the types of table wine most representative of Community production are types R I and A I as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 340/79 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85; whereas the guide prices for these types of wine as given in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1470/86 (4) have been set at the same level as that adopted for the preceding marketing year;
Whereas the third subparagraph of Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 provides that reference prices are also to be fixed for grape juice (including grape must) falling within subheading 20.07 B I of the Common Customs Tariff, for concentrated grape juice (including grape must) falling within subheadings 20.07 A I and B I of the Common Customs Tariff, for alcohol-muted fresh grape must as defined in Additional Note 4 (a) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, for wines fortified for distillation as defined in Additional Note 4 (b) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, and for liqueur wines as defined in Additional Note 4 (c) to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, since special reference prices are to be fixed for products in accordance with their special characteristics or uses, such prices should be fixed for wines of the Riesling or Sylvaner variety and for liqueur wines to be used in the preparation of products other than those falling within heading No 22.05 of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas, lastly, standard amounts corresponding to the normal costs of market preparation must be established for addition to the reference prices for the various products in cases where these are put up either in containers of not more than two litres or in containers of more than two but not more than 20 litres;
Whereas the reference prices for liqueur wines, which are fixed by the hectolitre, must be established having regard to the price level ruling in the Community for the product in question; whereas a total dry extract exceeding the normal limits is a characteristic feature of certain liqueur wines falling within subheading 22.05 C II of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas, pursuant to the rules in Additional Note 3 C to Chapter 22 of the Common Customs Tariff, the said liqueur wines are not classified in the category corresponding to their alcoholic strength but in the next higher category, and are therefore subject to a higher reference price than that fixed for the category which corresponds to their alcoholic strength; whereas, moreover, the mechanism referred to above does not apply to certain competing liqueur wines falling within subheadings 22.05 C III and 22.05 C IV; whereas, in view of the large volume of imports of the said wines, reference prices should be fixed for these wines so as to ensure equality of treatment between the various liqueur wines;
Whereas the fifth subparagraph of Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 makes provision for the reference price to be adjusted for the non-European parts of the Community; whereas the market situation is such that an adjustment is necessary only for the French overseas department of RĂŠunion;
Whereas the costs, with the exception of those in respect of losses incurred in bringing Community wines to the same marketing stage as imported wines, to be established as specified in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 344/79 (5), may be assessed at a standard rate; whereas there has been no substantial increase in these costs and the other factors to be considered since the last occasion on which prices were fixed;
Whereas the reference prices should be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 344/79; whereas, having regard to the aims of the
Community's wine-growing policy and the contribution which the Community intends to make to the harmonious development of world trade, the reference prices for the 1986/87 marketing year and the standard amount should be fixed at the same levels as those adopted for the previous marketing year;

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas table grapes are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas table grapes harvested during a given crop year are marketed from May to April of the next year; whereas the quantities harvested in May and June, during the first 20 days of July and also January to April of the next year are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these periods; whereas, due principally to developments in production techniques, a relatively large increase in the marketing of Community products during the last 10 days of November and in the month of December can be expected; whereas, however, the figures at present available are insufficiently conclusive to justify fixing a reference price for that period; whereas, reference prices should be fixed only for the period 21 July to 20 November inclusive;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 140 (2) and 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Spanish and Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first phase in the case of Spain and during the first stage in the case of Portugal;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas production in the Community of certain industrial products will remain in the course of 1996 unable to meet the specific requirements of the user industries in the Community; whereas, consequently, Community supplies of products of this type will depend to a considerable extent on imports from third countries; whereas the most urgent Community requirements for the products in question should be met immediately on the most favourable terms;

Whereas:
(1) In relation to the determination of the area of agricultural parcels eligible for area payments, experience has shown that it is necessary to define the acceptable width of certain features of the fields, in particular hedges, ditches and walls. In view of specific environmental needs, it is appropriate to provide some flexibility within the limits taken into account when the regional yields were fixed in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 of 17 May 1999 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1672/2000(4).
(2) The use of the computersed database in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97(5), is aimed at allowing in the framework of the integrated system in the sector of animal premia an extensively automated processing of steps of the administrative control and the reduction of the rate of controls on the spot. In order to ensure the correctness of the data in the database, false notifications due to reasons attributable to the applicant should be sanctioned immediately after being established.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2801/1999(7), should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4) It is appropriate at the same time to correct errors in the German and French versions of Article 6(5) and in the English version of Article 9(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92.
(5) The Committee of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by the chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2721/2000 of 13 December 2000 amending and correcting Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 laying down detailed rules for applying the integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 3887/92 is amended as follows:\n\n1.

(3) Imports of live poultry from China, Hong Kong and Macau to the Community are not authorised, whereas other birds can be imported under the conditions laid down in Article 7(A) of Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 95/176/EC(4).
(4) Commission Decision 2000/666/EC(5), as last amended by Decision 2001/383/EC(6), lays down the animal health requirements and the veterinary certifiction for the import of birds, other than poultry and the conditions for quarantine.
(5) Decision 2000/666/EC shall apply from 1 November 2001.
(6) The situation is liable to endanger the health status of the Community's poultry flocks, therefore the provisions foreseen in Decision 2000/666/EC should apply for such imports from China, Hong Kong and Macau immediately.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,","{'title': '2001/495/EC: Commission Decision of 2 July 2001 concerning certain protective measures with regard to live birds coming from or originating in China, Hong Kong and Macau (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2001) 1701)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe introduction into the territory of the Community of live birds other than those referred to in Directive 90/539/EEC, coming from or originating in China, Hong Kong and Macau is only authorised under the conditions laid down in the Articles 1 to 9 of Commission Decision 2000/666/EC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is applicable until 1 November 2001.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nMember States shall alter the measures they apply to trade in order to bring them into line with this Decision.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Directive 2002/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption(3), and in particular Article 4(1) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Since 28 February 2003 the Netherlands have declared several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(2) Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can pose a serious threat for the poultry industry.
(3) The Netherlands took immediate action as provided for by Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza(4), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, before the disease was officially confirmed.
(4) Directive 92/40/EEC sets out the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. The Member State may take more stringent action in the field covered by this Directive if deemed necessary and proportionate to contain the disease, taking into account the particular epidemiological, animal husbandry, commercial and social conditions prevailing.
(5) All movements of live poultry and hatching eggs within the Netherlands and their dispatch to other Member States have been prohibited. Furthermore the dispatch to Member States and third countries of fresh, unprocessed manure and litter of poultry should also be prohibited.
(6) The same prohibitions should apply to exports of poultry and hatching eggs to third countries in order to protect their health status and to prevent the risk of re-entry of such consignments in another Member State.
(7) For the sake of clarity and transparency the Commission after consultation with the Dutch authorities, thereby reinforcing the measures taken by the Netherlands, has taken Decision 2003/153/EC of 3 March 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to strong suspicion of avian influenza in the Netherlands(5).
(8) Subsequently Commission Decisions 2003/156/EC(6), 2003/172/EC(7), 2003/186/EC(8), 2003/191/EC(9) and 2003/214/EC(10) were adopted after consultation with the Dutch authorities and evaluation of the situation with all Member States.
(9) The favourable results of the surveillance programme carried out nationwide in the Netherlands suggested that the occurrence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus appeared to be restricted to a confined area in the centre of the Netherlands.
(10) However, despite the measures taken, on 4 April 2003 the disease was confirmed in turkey farms in the southern province of Limburg.
(11) In view of the occurrence of disease in Limburg, appropriate biosafety, control and surveillance measures are being taken in Belgium and Germany to prevent the introduction of disease into these countries.
(12) On basis of Decision 2003/214/EC, the Dutch authorities started preventive emptying and culling of poultry in holdings and areas at risk which should be completed swiftly in order to avoid further spreading of the virus.
(13) As a further disease control measure, the Dutch authorities have applied the strategy of compartmentalisation by dividing the territory into several compartments by restricting transports and activities linked to the poultry sector between compartments.
(14) Fresh poultry meat destined for intra-Community trade has to be marked with a health mark in accordance with the health mark foreseen in Chapter XII of Annex I to Council Directive 71/118/EEC(11), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(12). In order to allow the marketing on the Dutch market of fresh poultry meat obtained from poultry originating from the established surveillance zones, special provisions for its health marking shall be laid down.
(15) The Dutch authorities should reinforce bio-security and hygiene measures including cleaning and disinfection procedures to prevent the further spread of the disease at all levels of poultry and egg production.
(16) The measures laid down in Decision 2003/214/EC must be adapted in the light of the evolution of the disease.
(17) The other Member States have already adjusted the measures they apply to trade, and they are sufficiently informed by the Commission, and, in particular in the context of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, on the appropriate period for their implementation.
(18) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': '2003/258/EC: Commission Decision of 10 April 2003 concerning protective measures in relation to avian influenza in the Netherlands (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 1256)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(3) Following the non-participation to the annual proficiency test organised by the ANSES in 2012, the authorisation granted on 20 November 2002 in accordance with Decision 2000/258/EC to the VETCOM Food Analysis and Diagnostic Laboratory, in Fort Sam Houston has been withdrawn in accordance with Commission Decision 2010/436/EU (2).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (2), and in particular Article 80(1)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Directive 91/414/EEC shall continue to apply to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC before 14 June 2011.
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in March 2006 the United Kingdom received an application from Nissan Chemical Europe SARL for the inclusion of the active substance amisulbrom in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2007/669/EC (3) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(3) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in February 2007 Ireland received an application from DuPont International Operations SARL for the inclusion of the active substance chlorantraniliprole in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2007/560/EC (4) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(4) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in August 2005 the United Kingdom received an application from Dow Agrosciences for the inclusion of the active substance meptyldinocap in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2006/589/EC (5) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(5) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in March 2004 the United Kingdom received an application from Syngenta Ltd for the inclusion of the active substance pinoxaden in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2005/459/EC (6) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(6) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in January 2003 the Netherlands received an application from Enhold BV for the inclusion of the active substance silver thiosulphate in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2003/850/EC (7) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(7) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in November 2005 Austria received an application from Bayer CropScience AG for the inclusion of the active substance tembotrione in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2006/586/EC (8) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(8) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods of up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the conditions relating to the detailed assessment of the active substances and the plant protection products in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.
(9) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the respective draft assessment reports to the Commission on 15 July 2008 (amisulbrom), on 11 February 2009 (chlorantraniliprole), on 25 October 2006 (meptyldinocap), on 30 November 2005 (pinoxaden), on 9 November 2005 (silver thiosulphate) and on 2 February 2007 (tembotrione).
(10) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the time-frame provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC, read in conjunction with Commission Decisions 2010/353/EU (9) (amisulbrom, chlorantraniliprole, meptyldinocap and pinoxaden) and 2010/149/EU (10) (silver thiosulphate and tembotrione).
(11) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on a possible approval in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 for amisulbrom, chlorantraniliprole, meptyldinocap, pinoxaden, silver thiosulphate and tembotrione will have been completed within 24 months.

The extent to which import licences may be issued should therefore be determined by establishing the allocation coefficient to be applied to the quantities requested under the quotas in question.

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Council Decision 94/375/EC (3), the European Investment Fund (the ‘Fund’) was founded in 1994 to ‘stimulate sustained and balanced growth within the Community’.
(2) Following an increase in the Fund's subscribed capital in 2007, the authorised capital of the Fund is EUR 3 billion, divided into 3 000 shares of EUR 1 million each with a ratio of 20 % of the capital paid-in. The Union, represented by the Commission, participated in the previous increase of the Fund's subscribed capital in accordance with Council Decision 2007/247/EC (4).
(3) Consequently, the Union, represented by the Commission, is currently subscribed to 900 shares of the Fund in total for a nominal value of EUR 900 million, of which EUR 180 million are paid-in.
(4) The European Council of 28-29 June 2012 adopted the ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’ to stimulate smart, sustainable, inclusive, resource-efficient and job-creating growth. In that context, the European Council in its conclusions emphasized that, among the further urgent actions needed at Union level to boost growth and jobs, to enhance the financing of the economy and make Europe more competitive as a location for production and investment, the activity of the Fund should be developed, particularly as regards its venture activity, in liaison with existing national structures such as national promotional banks and institutions.
(5) In order to further promote investment and access to credit, the European Council of 27-28 June 2013 launched a ‘New Investment Plan for Europe’ to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and boost the financing of the economy. In that context, the European Council in its conclusions asked the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) to implement an increase in the Fund's credit enhancement capacity as a matter of priority.
(6) Recalling that restoring normal lending to the economy, in particular to SMEs, remains a priority, the European Council of 19-20 December 2013 called on the Commission and the EIB to further enhance the capacity of the Fund through an increase in its capital with a view to reaching final agreement by May 2014.
(7) The current size of the Fund's own funds does not allow for a substantial increase in the Fund's activity, as called for by the European Council, since the guarantee and venture capital operations of the Fund may not exceed the ceiling on the overall commitments of the Fund established by the Statutes of the Fund or by the General Meeting of the Fund. Furthermore, the credit enhancement capacity of the Fund is limited by the size of its available own funds.
(8) On 26 November 2013, the Fund's Board of Directors thus gave its approval as to the rationale for an increase in the Fund's subscribed capital by up to EUR 1 500 million, allowing for the necessary increase of the own funds. The technical arrangements and detailed procedure for the increase will be submitted to the Board of Directors in due course in order to request authorisation to submit a proposal to the 2014 General Meeting of the Fund for approval.
(9) New shares should be subscribed by the Fund's shareholders at their discretion over a four-year period, starting in 2014 and ending in 2017. The price of the new shares should be set annually and be based on the net asset value formula agreed between the Fund's shareholders.
(10) The agreement on the funding of the Union contribution to the Fund's capital increase should be without prejudice to the possible treatment of dividends.
(11) It is appropriate for the Union to participate in the capital increase of the Fund in order to achieve the Union's objectives of encouraging an environment favourable to initiative and to the development of undertakings throughout the Union, particularly SMEs, and of fostering better exploitation of the industrial potential of the Union's policies of innovation, research and technological development, as articulated in the conclusions of the European Council of 28-29 June 2012, 27-28 June 2013 and 19-20 December 2013 and detailed in the ‘Compact for Growth and Jobs’ and the ‘New Investment Plan for Europe’.
(12) With regard to the specific objectives pursued by the Union's participation in the increase of the Fund's capital, in particular the Fund's support for actions which complement Member States' actions in favour of enterprises, particularly SMEs, Article 173(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides the necessary powers for the adoption of this Decision.
(13) In order to allow the Union representative in the Fund's General Meeting to vote on the capital increase as soon as possible, this Decision should enter into force on the day following that of its publication,","{'header': '24.5.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 156/1', 'title': 'DECISION No 562/2014/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 May 2014\non the participation of the European Union in the capital increase of the European Investment Fund', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Council Decision 94/375/EC(3), the European Investment Fund (the ‘Fund’) was founded in 1994 to ‘stimulate sustained and balanced growth within the Community’.\n\n((2)) Following an increase in the Fund's subscribed capital in 2007, the authorised capital of the Fund is EUR 3\xa0billion, divided into 3\xa0000 shares of EUR 1 million each with a ratio of 20 % of the capital paid-in.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 21 August 2012
pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data by the Eastern Republic of Uruguay with regard to automated processing of personal data
(notified under document C(2012) 5704)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2012/484/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor (2),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States’ laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25 thereof.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the European Union’s present international commitments.
(5) The Political Constitution of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, passed in 1967, does not expressly recognise the rights to privacy and the protection of personal data. However, the catalogue of fundamental rights is not a closed list since Article 72 of the Constitution provides that the listing of rights, obligations and guarantees made by the Constitution does not exclude others that are inherent to the human personality or that derive from the republican form of government. Article 1 of Act No 18.331 on the Protection of Personal Data and ‘Habeas Data’ Action of 11 August 2008 (Ley No 18.331 de Protección de Datos Personales y Acción de ‘Habeas Data’) expressly sets out that ‘the right to the protection of personal data is inherent to the human being and it is therefore included in Article 72 of the Constitution of the Republic’. Article 332 of the Constitution provides that the application of the provisions of this Constitution that acknowledge individuals’ rights as well as those awarding rights and imposing obligations on public authorities, shall not be impaired by of the lack of specific regulation; rather, it shall be based, through recourse to the underlying principles of similar laws, on the general principles of the law and generally accepted doctrines.
(6) The legal standards for the protection of personal data in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay are largely based on the standards set out in Directive 95/46/EC and are laid down in Act No 18.331 on the Protection of Personal Data and ‘Habeas Data’ Action (Ley No 18.331 de Protección de Datos Personales y de Acción de ‘Habeas Data’) of 11 August 2008. It covers natural persons and legal persons.
(7) This Act is further complemented by Decree No 414/009 of 31 August 2009, adopted in order to clarify several aspects of the Act and to lay down the detailed regulation of the organisation, powers and functioning of the data protection supervisory authority; The Preamble of the Decree sets out that it is appropriate to adjust the national legal system on this matter to the most accepted comparable legal regime, essentially that established by European countries through Directive 95/46/EC.
(8) Data protection provisions are also contained in a number of special acts that create and regulate databases, namely, acts regulating certain public registries (public deeds, industrial property and trade marks, personal acts, real estate, mining or credit reporting). Act No 18.331 applies additionally to these acts in relation to those issues that are not governed by these specific legal instruments, pursuant to Article 332 of the Constitution.
(9) The legal data protection standards applicable in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, and also provide for exceptions and limitations in order to safeguard important public interests. These legal data protection standards and the exceptions reflect the principles laid down by Directive 95/46/EC.
(10) The application of the legal data protection standards is guaranteed by administrative and judicial remedies, in particular, by the ‘habeas data’ action, which enables a data subject to take a data controller to court in order to enforce his right of access, rectification and deletion, and by independent supervision carried out by the supervisory authority, the Unit for the Regulation and Control of Personal Data (Unidad Reguladora y de Control de Datos Personales (URCDP)), which is invested with powers of investigation, intervention and sanction in line with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC, and which acts completely independently. Moreover, any interested party is entitled to seek judicial redress for compensation for damages suffered as a result of the unlawful processing of his personal data.
(11) Uruguayan data protection authorities have provided explanations and assurances as to how the Uruguayan law is to be interpreted, and have given assurances that the Uruguayan data protection legislation is implemented in accordance with such interpretation. In particular, Uruguayan data protection authorities have explained that, pursuant to Article 332 of the Constitution, Act No 18.331 applies additionally to special acts that create and regulate specific databases in relation to those issues that are not governed by these specific legal instruments. They have also clarified that, regarding the lists referred to in Article 9 C) of Act No 18.331, and which do not require the consent of the data subject for the processing, the Act also applies, namely the principles of proportionality and finality, the rights of data subjects and that they are subject to the supervision by the data protection authority. With regard to the transparency principle, the Uruguayan data protection authorities have informed that the obligation to provide the data subject with the necessary information applies in all cases. Regarding the right of access, the data protection authority has clarified that it is sufficient for a data subject to prove its identity when making a request. The Uruguayan data protection authorities have clarified that the exceptions relating to the principle on international transfers laid down in Article 23(1) of Act No 18.331 cannot be understood as having a broader application than that of Article 26(1) of Directive 95/46/EC.
(12) This Decision takes into account these explanations and assurances and it is based upon them.
(13) The Eastern Republic of Uruguay is also party to the American Convention of Human Rights (‘Pact of San José de Costa Rica) of 22 November 1969, and in force since 18 July 1978 (3). Article 11 of this Convention lays down the right to privacy and Article 30 sets out that restrictions that, pursuant to this Convention, may be placed on the enjoyment or exercise of the rights or freedoms recognised by the Convention may not be applied except in accordance with laws enacted for reasons of general interest and in accordance with the purpose for which such restrictions have been established (Article 30). Moreover the Eastern Republic of Uruguay has accepted the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. Furthermore at the 1118th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies of the Council of Europe held on 6 July 2011, the Deputies invited the Eastern Republic of Uruguay to accede the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No 108) and to its Additional Protocol (ETS No 118), after a favourable opinion of the relevant Consultative Committee (4).
(14) The Eastern Republic of Uruguay should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(15) This Decision should concern the adequacy of protection provided in the Eastern Republic of Uruguay with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC. It should not affect other conditions or restrictions implementing other provisions of that Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States.
(16) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(17) The Commission should monitor the functioning of the Decision and report any pertinent findings to the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC. Such monitoring should cover, inter alia, the Eastern Republic of Uruguay’s regime applicable to transfers in the framework of international treaties.
(18) The Working Party on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered a favourable opinion on the level of adequacy as regards protection of personal data which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision (5).
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC,","{'header': '23.8.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 227/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 21 August 2012\npursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data by the Eastern Republic of Uruguay with regard to automated processing of personal data\n(notified under document C(2012) 5704)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/484/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States’ laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.\n\n((2)) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 of 12 June 2001 on checks on conformity to the marketing standards applicable to fresh fruit and vegetables(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2590/2001(4), lays down the requirements for approval of conformity checks performed prior to import into the Community by third countries which so request.
(2) On 11 March 2002 the South African authorities sent the Commission a request for approval of checking operations performed by the Perishable Products Export Control Board (PPECB) under the responsibility of the Ministry of Agriculture. This states that the establishment in question has the necessary staff, equipment and facilities to carry out checks, that it uses methods equivalent to those referred to in Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 and that the fresh fruit and vegetables exported from South Africa to the Community must meet standards equivalent to the Community marketing standards.
(3) The information sent by the Member States and in the possession of the Commission shows that, between 1997 and 2002, imports of fresh fruit and vegetables from South Africa presented a relatively low incidence of non-conformity with the marketing standards.
(4) Representatives of the South African inspection services are regular participants in international efforts to agree marketing standards for fruit and vegetables in the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE). South Africa is also taking part in the Scheme for the Application of International Standards for Fruit and Vegetables under the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Lastly, for a number of years the South African inspection services have taken part in various conferences and training activities organised by several Member States.
(5) The conformity checks performed by South Africa should therefore be approved with effect from the date on which the administrative cooperation referred to in Article 7(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1148/2001 is established.

The distilling method is described in paragraph 3 of this Chapter. Distillation eliminates non-volatile substances. Homologues of ethanol, together with ethanol and ethanol homologues in ethyl esters, are included in the alcoholic strength since they occur in the distillate.\nThe density of the distillate obtained is then measured. The density of a liquid at a given temperature is equal to the quotient of the mass over its volume:\nρ = m/V, for wine, it is expressed in g/ml.\nFor a hydroalcoholic solution such as a distillate, where the temperature is known, tables can be used to map density and alcoholic strength. This alcoholic strength corresponds to that of wine (distillation volume by volume).\nIn this method the density of the distillate is measured by electronic densimetry using a frequency oscillator. The principle consists of measuring the period of oscillation of a tube containing the sample subject to electromagnetic excitation. The density can then be calculated – it is linked to the period of oscillation by the following formula:\n(1)\nρ\n=\ndensity of the sample\nT\n=\nperiod of vibration induced\nM\n=\nmass of the empty tube\nC\n=\nspring constant\nV\n=\nvolume of the sample in vibration\nThis link takes the form ρ = A T\n2\n– B (2); hence there is a linear relationship between the density and the period squared. The constants A and B are specific to each oscillator and are estimated by measuring the period of fluids of known density.\n1.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Reagents and products\n1.4.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Reference fluids\nTwo reference fluids are used to adjust the densimeter. The densities of the reference fluids must encompass those of the distillates to be measured. A difference in the density of the reference fluids greater than 0,01000\xa0g/ml is recommended. Their density must be known with a degree of uncertainty below +/- 0,00005\xa0g/ml, at a temperature of 20,00\xa0°C +/- 0,05\xa0°C.\nTo measure the alcoholic strength by volume using an electronic densimeter, the reference fluids are:\n—\ndry air (unpolluted),\n—\nwater of at least grade 3 as defined by ISO 3696:1987 should be used,\n—\nhydroalcoholic solutions of reference density,\n—\nsolutions linked to national viscosity standards below 2 mm\n2\n/s.\n1.4.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Cleaning and drying products\n—\ndetergents, acids,\n—\norganic solvents: ethanol 96\xa0% vol., pure acetone.\n1.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Apparatus\n1.5.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Electronic densimeter using a frequency oscillator\nThe electronic densimeter comprises the following:\n—\na measuring cell with a measuring tube and thermostatic chamber,\n—\na system for making the tube oscillate and for measuring the period of oscillation,\n—\na clock,\n—\na digital display unit, and possibly a calculator.\nThe densimeter is placed on a perfectly stable stand that is insulated from all vibrations.\n1.5.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Controlling the temperature in the measuring cell\nThe measuring tube is placed in a thermostatic chamber. The temperature stability must be +/- 0,02\xa0°C or better.\nWhere possible, the temperature of the measuring cell should be checked as this has a strong impact on the measurement results. The density of a hydroalcoholic solution of 10\xa0% vol is 0,98471\xa0g/ml at 20\xa0°C and 0,98447\xa0g/ml at 21\xa0°C, or a difference of 0,00024\xa0g/ml.\nThe trial temperature is set at 20\xa0°C. The temperature is measured in the cell using a thermometer with a resolution of below 0,01\xa0°C in line with national standards. It should guarantee a temperature measurement with under +/- 0,07\xa0°C uncertainty.\n1.5.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Calibration of the apparatus\nThe apparatus must be calibrated before its first use, then every six months or if the check is unsatisfactory. Two reference fluids should be used to calculate the constants A and B (see above formula 2). Calibration should be carried out in line with the operating instructions for the apparatus. In principle, calibration is carried out using dry air (taking into account atmospheric pressure) and extremely pure water (twice distilled and/or micro-filtered with extremely high resistivity > 18 MΩ).\n1.5.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Checking the calibration\nTo check the calibration, measure the density of the reference fluids.\nThe air density should be checked every day. A difference between the theoretical and the actual density greater than 0,00008\xa0g/ml may indicate that the tube is blocked. It should therefore be cleaned. After cleaning, check the air density once again. If this check is not conclusive, the apparatus must be adjusted.\nCheck the water density also. If the difference between the theoretical and the actual density is greater than 0,00008\xa0g/ml, the apparatus should be adjusted.\nIf it is difficult to check the temperature of the cell, the density of a hydroalcoholic solution with an alcoholic strength by volume comparable to that of the distillates analysed can be checked directly.\n1.5.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Checks\nIf the difference between the theoretical density of a reference solution (known with under 0,00005\xa0g/ml uncertainty) and the measurement is greater than 0,00008\xa0g/ml, the temperature of the cell must be checked.\n1.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0Sampling and preparation of the samples\n(see point 3 of this Chapter, “Method of obtaining distillate”).\n1.7.\xa0\xa0\xa0Procedure\nAfter obtaining the distillate, measure its density or alcoholic strength by volume using densimetry.\nFirst ensure the temperature stability of the measuring cell. The distillate in the densimeter cell must not contain air bubbles and must be homogeneous. If a lighting system is available which can help verify the absence of bubbles, it should quickly be switched off after carrying out the checks as the heat generated by the bulb affects the measuring temperature.\nIf the apparatus only gives the period, the density should be calculated using the constants A and B (see 1.3). If the apparatus does not give the alcoholic strength by volume directly, this can be obtained from the tables.\n1.8.\xa0\xa0\xa0Expression of results\nThe alcoholic strength by volume of the wine is that obtained for the distillate. It is expressed in “%\xa0vol”.\nIf the temperature conditions cannot be complied with, correct the result to express it at 20\xa0°C. Give the result to two decimal places.\n1.9.\xa0\xa0\xa0Remarks\nThe volume placed in the measuring cell must be large enough to avoid any contamination by the previous sample. Consequently, at least two measurements should be carried out. If these do not give results within the repeatability limit, a third measurement is needed. The results of the last two measurements are normally homogeneous and the first value is eliminated.\n1.10.\xa0\xa0\xa0Precision\nFor samples with an alcoholic strength by volume of between 4 and 18\xa0% vol\nRepeatability (r)\n=\n0,067 (% vol)\nReproducibility (R)\n=\n0,0454 + 0,0105 × alcoholic strength by volume\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Interlaboratory trials. Precision and accuracy on adjuncts\nThe method performance characteristics shown in paragraph 1.10 were obtained from an interlaboratory test carried out in accordance with established international procedures on six samples and by eleven laboratories.\nAll the details and repeatability and reproducibility calculations carried out in this test are described in the Chapter “\nTITRE ALCOOMETRIQUE VOLUMIQUE\n” (Alcoholic strength by volume) (point 4.B.2) of the OIV’s “\nRecueil International des Méthodes d’Analyse\n” (compendium of analysis methods – 2004 edition).’'}]}"

(1) Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
(2) Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
(3) Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
(4) Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
(5) Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
(6) Whereas parconazole should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry. Infections with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry cause two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.
(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other holdings where poultry or other captive birds are kept. As a result it may spread from one Member State to other Member States or to third countries through trade in live birds or their products.
(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (3) sets out certain preventive measures relating to the surveillance and the early detection of avian influenza and the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of that disease in poultry or other captive birds. That Directive provides for the establishment of protection and surveillance zones in the event of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(5) Germany notified the Commission of two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in non-commercial holdings in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania where poultry are kept and it immediately took the measures required pursuant to Directive 2005/94/EC, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones, which should be defined in Parts A and B of the Annex to this Decision.
(6) The Commission has examined those measures in collaboration with Germany, and it is satisfied that the borders of the protection and surveillance zones, established by the competent authority in that Member State, are at a sufficient distance to the actual holdings where the outbreaks were confirmed.
(7) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to trade within the Union and to avoid unjustified barriers to trade being imposed by third countries, it is necessary to rapidly describe the protection and surveillance zones established in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in Germany at Union level.
(8) Accordingly, the protection and surveillance zones in Germany, where the animal health control measures as laid down in Directive 2005/94/EC are applied, should be defined in this Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '27.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 56/68', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/315\nof 25 February 2015\nconcerning certain protective measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N8 in Germany\n(notified under document C(2015) 1004)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) and Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC (2), and in particular the first and second subparagraphs of Article 3(1), the first subparagraph of Article 6(1), Article 7(e) and Article 13(1)(e) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2004/68/EC lays down, inter alia, specific animal health requirements for the importation into and transit through the Union of live ungulates which are to be based on the rules laid down in Union legislation for the diseases to which those animals are susceptible.
(2) Directive 2004/68/EC also provides that specific conditions may be laid down for third countries for which equivalence has been formally recognised by the Union based on the official health guarantees provided by the third country concerned.
(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (3) lays down, inter alia, the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals, including consignments of domestic bovine animals. Annex I to that Regulation establishes a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union, as well as the specific conditions for the consignments from certain third countries.
(4) In addition, Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 sets out a model of veterinary certificate for domestic bovine animals (including Bubalus and Bison species and their cross-breeds) intended for breeding and/or production after importation (BOV-X) and a model of veterinary certificate for domestic bovine animals (including Bubalus and Bison species and their cross-breeds) intended for immediate slaughter after importation (BOV-Y), which include guarantees for bovine tuberculosis.
(5) Council Directive 64/432/EEC (4) lays down rules for intra-Union trade in bovine animals and provides for the monitoring and eradication programmes for certain diseases affecting those animals, including tuberculosis. New Zealand has requested for the recognition of its bovine tuberculosis control programme as being equivalent to the monitoring and eradication programmes for bovine tuberculosis that are implemented by the Member States in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC. The information provided by New Zealand on its bovine tuberculosis control programme demonstrates that the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd classified as ‘C2’, under the National Pest Management Strategy for bovine tuberculosis of New Zealand, is equivalent to the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd that is recognised in a Member State as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’ in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC.
(6) Therefore, the list and the specific conditions set out in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, as well as the models of veterinary certificates BOV-X and BOV-Y set out in Part 2 of that Annex should be amended in order to reflect the special conditions by which the Union recognises the equivalence of the classification of bovine herds as ‘C2’ within the framework of the bovine tuberculosis control programme implemented in New Zealand with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC for a bovine herd in a Member State recognised as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 lays down, inter alia, the conditions for the importation into the Union of consignments of fresh meat of domestic bovine animals. To this end, it sets out in Annex II thereto a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union and the models of veterinary certificates to accompany those consignments, taking into account any specific conditions or supplementary guarantees required.
(8) On 19 September 2011, Paraguay notified an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) (5). Following that notification, Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1112/2011 (6), suspended imports into the Union of fresh meat of domestic bovine animals from that third country.
(9) The last outbreak of FMD in Paraguay occurred in January 2012. By November 2013, the OIE recognised Paraguay as a country with two FMD free zones, covering the whole of the territory of Paraguay, where vaccination is practiced (7).
(10) In April 2014, an audit was carried out by the Commission to verify the efficacy of the measures taken and the official controls in providing animal health guarantees with regard to FMD (8). The Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) concluded that the animal health control system in Paraguay offered satisfactory guarantees with regard to FMD, in compliance with or equivalent to the Union requirements for the introduction of deboned and matured fresh meat of domestic bovine animals. However, Paraguay was requested to substantiate the absence of the FMD virus on its territory and the effectiveness of its vaccination programme.
(11) During the second half of 2014, Paraguay carried out serological surveys based on the guidelines provided for in Chapter 8.7 of the OIE's Terrestrial Animals Health Code, Edition 2014 (9). Following an evaluation of the results, the Commission concluded that there was sufficient evidence to substantiate the absence of the FMD virus in Paraguay and it was satisfied with the effectiveness of the vaccination programme. Paraguay thus provides sufficient animal health guarantees and it has requested to be authorised for exports into the Union of deboned and matured fresh meat of domestic bovine animals.
(12) In addition, Israel is referred to in the list set out in Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010. For the sake of market transparency and in accordance with international law, it should be clarified that in the case of Israel the territorial coverage of the veterinary certificates is limited to the territory of the State of Israel, excluding the territories under Israeli administration since June 1967, namely the Golan Heights, the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank.
(13) Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended in order to authorise imports into the Union of fresh meat of domestic bovine animals from Paraguay and to amend the entry for Israel.
(14) Annexes I and II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(15) To avoid any disruption of imports into the Union of consignments of domestic bovine animals, the use of veterinary certificates issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 in their versions prior to the amendments being introduced by this Regulation should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.
(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '17.4.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 100/60', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/604\nof 16 April 2015\namending Annexes I and II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as regards animal health requirements for bovine tuberculosis in the models of veterinary certificates BOV-X and BOV-Y and the entries for Israel, New Zealand and Paraguay in the lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which the introduction into the Union of live animals and fresh meat is authorised\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2004/68/EC lays down, inter alia, specific animal health requirements for the importation into and transit through the Union of live ungulates which are to be based on the rules laid down in Union legislation for the diseases to which those animals are susceptible.\n\n((2)) Directive 2004/68/EC also provides that specific conditions may be laid down for third countries for which equivalence has been formally recognised by the Union based on the official health guarantees provided by the third country concerned.\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010(3)lays down, inter alia, the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals, including consignments of domestic bovine animals. Annex I to that Regulation establishes a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union, as well as the specific conditions for the consignments from certain third countries.\n\n((4)) In addition, Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 sets out a model of veterinary certificate for domestic bovine animals (including Bubalus and Bison species and their cross-breeds) intended for breeding and/or production after importation (BOV-X) and a model of veterinary certificate for domestic bovine animals (including Bubalus and Bison species and their cross-breeds) intended for immediate slaughter after importation (BOV-Y), which include guarantees for bovine tuberculosis.\n\n((5)) Council Directive 64/432/EEC(4)lays down rules for intra-Union trade in bovine animals and provides for the monitoring and eradication programmes for certain diseases affecting those animals, including tuberculosis. New Zealand has requested for the recognition of its bovine tuberculosis control programme as being equivalent to the monitoring and eradication programmes for bovine tuberculosis that are implemented by the Member States in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC. The information provided by New Zealand on its bovine tuberculosis control programme demonstrates that the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd classified as ‘C2’, under the National Pest Management Strategy for bovine tuberculosis of New Zealand, is equivalent to the bovine tuberculosis status of a bovine herd that is recognised in a Member State as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’ in accordance with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC.\n\n((6)) Therefore, the list and the specific conditions set out in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, as well as the models of veterinary certificates BOV-X and BOV-Y set out in Part 2 of that Annex should be amended in order to reflect the special conditions by which the Union recognises the equivalence of the classification of bovine herds as ‘C2’ within the framework of the bovine tuberculosis control programme implemented in New Zealand with the conditions set out in Annex A.I to Directive 64/432/EEC for a bovine herd in a Member State recognised as being an ‘officially tuberculosis-free bovine herd’.\n\n((7)) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 lays down, inter alia, the conditions for the importation into the Union of consignments of fresh meat of domestic bovine animals. To this end, it sets out in Annex II thereto a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union and the models of veterinary certificates to accompany those consignments, taking into account any specific conditions or supplementary guarantees required.\n\n((8)) On 19 September 2011, Paraguay notified an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)(5). Following that notification, Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1112/2011(6), suspended imports into the Union of fresh meat of domestic bovine animals from that third country.\n\n((9)) The last outbreak of FMD in Paraguay occurred in January 2012.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 80 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1608/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2631/2000(4), extends until 31 January 2001 the application of certain Council provisions repealed by Article 81 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 pending finalisation and adoption of the definitive measures to implement that Regulation. It lays down in particular that Articles 1 and 3 of, and the Annex to, Council Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 of 28 June 1984 authorising the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 337/79(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2839/98(6), should remain in force until 31 January 2001. However, Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 stipulates that these provisions would remain in force until 31 December 2003. Under Article 45(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Commission presented a proposal for a Council regulation authorising until 31 December 2003 the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, which applies similar provisions on the same terms as those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84. However, it seems likely that the Council will not be able to adopt this proposal before 31 January 2001. To enable the Council to adopt this proposal without interrupting the status quo where the products referred to in Articles 1 and 3 of, and the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 are concerned, these provisions should be maintained until the Council takes a decision, or until 31 December 2003 at the latest. This Regulation must apply from 1 February 2001 for the same reason.
(2) The extra transitional period does not affect the implementation of the bulk of the reform of the common organisation of the market in wine on the date set by the Council, since the main points concerning the areas covered by those Regulations have been settled in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 or in the implementing regulations already adopted.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 66/401/EEC of 14 June 1966 on the marketing of fodder plant seed  (1), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (2),
Having regard to the Seventh Council Decision 85/355/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the equivalence of  field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops (3), as last amended by  Directive 90/654/EEC, and in particular in Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the Seventh Council Decision 85/356/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the equivalence of seed  produced in third countries (4), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC, and in particular Article  4 thereof,
Whereas, in Decision 85/355/EEC, the Council determined that field inspections carried out in  certain third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species satisfy the conditions laid down  in the Community Directives;
Whereas, in Decision 85/356/EEC, the Council determined that seed of certain species produced in  certain third countries is equivalent to corresponding seed produced in the Community;
Whereas for certain species these determinations include New Zealand;
Whereas an examination of the rules of New Zealand and of the manner in which they are applied has  shown that, in respect of California bluebell, the prescribed field inspections satisfy the  conditions laid down in Annex I to Directive 66/401/EEC and the conditions governing seed harvested  and controlled there afford the same assurances, as regards the seed's characteristics, identity,  examination, marking and control as do the conditions applicable to such seed harvested and  controlled within the Community;
Whereas the existing equivalence for New Zealand should therefore be extended accordingly;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the  Standing Committee on Seeds and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,","{'title': '91/554/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 October 1991 amending the Seventh Council Decision 85/355/EEC on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed\xadproducing crops and the Seventh Council Decision 85/356/EEC on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nIn the table in Part I (2) of the Annex to Decision 85/355/EEC the  species 'Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.` is hereby added after the species 'Medicago sativa` in  column 3 of the entry relating to New Zealand.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nIn the table in Part I (2) of the Annex to Decision 85/356/EEC the species 'Phacelia  tanacetifolia Benth.` is hereby added after the species 'Medicago sativa` in column 3 of the entry  relating to New Zealand.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 October 1991.\n\nFor the Commission Ray MAC SHARRY Member of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ N° L 125, 11. 7. 1966, p. 2 298/66.\n\n(2) OJ N° L 353, 17. 12. 1990, p. 48.\n\n(3) OJ N° L 195, 26. 7. 1985, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ N° L 195, 26. 7. 1985, p. 20.'}]}"
