COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 509/2008
of 6 June 2008
fixing the final complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries for the marketing year 2007/08
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 29(4),
Whereas:
(1) Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that, during the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 marketing years and in order to ensure adequate supply to Community refineries, import duties on a complementary quantity of imports of raw cane sugar originating in the States referred to in Annex VI to that Regulation are to be suspended.
(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2), on the basis of an exhaustive Community forecast supply balance for raw sugar.
(3) For the 2007/08 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar for refining of 286 597 tonnes in white sugar equivalent so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met. This complementary quantity includes an estimation of applications for import licences in the final months of the 2007/08 marketing year, concerning imports referred to in Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1100/2006 of 17 July 2006 laying down, for the marketing years 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09, detailed rules for the opening and administration of tariff quotas for raw cane sugar for refining, originating in least developed countries, as well as detailed rules applying to the importation of products of tariff heading 1701 originating in least developed countries (3).
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1545/2007 of 20 December 2007 fixing the complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries in the period from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2008 (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 97/2008 of 1 February 2008 fixing a complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries for the marketing year 200708 (5) already fixed complementary quantities of respectively 80 000 tonnes and 120 000 tonnes. It is therefore appropriate to fix the final quantity of complementary sugar of 86 597 tonnes for the marketing year 2007/08.
(5) Adequate supply of the refineries can only be guaranteed if the traditional export agreements between the beneficiary countries are respected. Therefore a breakdown between the beneficiary countries or group of countries is needed. For India, a quantity of 6 000 tonnes is opened which brings the total quantity for the marketing year 2007/08 for India to 20 000 tonnes which is considered an economically viable shipping quantity. The remaining quantities should be fixed for the ACP States, which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.
(6) Prior to the import of this complementary sugar, the refiners need to make supply and shipping arrangements with the beneficiary countries and trade. In order to allow them to prepare for the application for import licences in due time, it is appropriate to provide for the entry into force of this Regulation as from the date of its publication.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '7.6.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 149/59', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 509/2008\nof 6 June 2008\nfixing the final complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries for the marketing year 2007/08', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that, during the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 marketing years and in order to ensure adequate supply to Community refineries, import duties on a complementary quantity of imports of raw cane sugar originating in the States referred to in Annex VI to that Regulation are to be suspended.\n\n((2)) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/07, 2007/08 and 2008/09 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements(2), on the basis of an exhaustive Community forecast supply balance for raw sugar.\n\n((3)) For the 2007/08 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar for refining of 286\xa0597 tonnes in white sugar equivalent so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Community supplies of certain fishery products currently depend on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to jeopardise the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure that all Community importers have equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;
Whereas it is for the Community to decide on the opening of autonomous tariff quotas; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(1) codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 745/1999 of 30 March 1999 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

for the destruction of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition in Ukraine
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to Council Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP of 12 July 2002 on the European Union’s contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof, in conjunction with Article 23(2) of the Treaty on European Union,
Whereas:
(1) In the past Ukraine had a large military industrial complex, held in the third largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the world, and served as a base for the USSR’s strategic reserves of arms and ammunition.
(2) Some estimates suggest that Ukraine holds as much as 7 million Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and 2 million tonnes of ammunition, much of which dates from the previous world wars. These large quantities of SALW and ammunition not only represent a huge surplus in terms’ of Ukraine’s current armed forces levels but also include large numbers of unserviceable and hazardous items of ammunition.
(3) The EU-Ukraine Action Plan was adopted by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council on 21 February 2005 and calls upon both parties to jointly address threats for security, public health and environment, posed by Ukrainian stockpiles of old ammunition, inter alia, anti-personnel land mines.
(4) The NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency (NAMSA), under the terms of the Partnership for Peace (PfP) Trust Fund, is managing a twelve year project aimed at the destruction of 1,5 million surplus SALW and 133 000 tonnes of conventional ammunition to be executed in four phases.
(5) The European Union considers that a financial contribution to the first phase of this project would help Ukraine to reduce the risks related to the accumulation of large quantities of SALW and ammunition and accommodate the level of SALW and ammunition to its current armed forces levels.
(6) On 18 May 2005 the Parliament of Ukraine ratified the Convention on the prohibition of the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines and on their destruction, (Ottawa Convention).
(7) The European Union therefore intends to offer financial support to Ukraine in accordance with Title II of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP.

amending Decision 89/218/ECSC concerning aid that the Italian Government proposes to grant to the public steel sector
(only the Italian text is authentic)
(90/89/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular to Article 95 (1) and (2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision 89/218/ECSC of 23 December 1988 concerning aid that the Italian Government proposes to grant to the public steel sector (1), and in particular Article 2 (4) thereof,
Having consulted the Consultative Committee and with the unanimous assent of the Council,
Whereas:
The sustained growth of the steel market during the first half of 1989 has led to a temporary tightening of the possibility of buying slabs within the Community at an economic price level. It appears therefore reasonable to extend the closure deadline for the Bagnoli liquid steelmaking facility laid down in Article 2 (3) of Decision 89/218/ECSC in order to allow the Italian public steel sector to carry out this closure in an orderly way without excessive detrimental consequences for the continued operation, according to plan, of the Bagnoli mill for strips, a product for which the Italian deficit in the intra-Community trade has been increasing during the same period.
Well-founded technical reasons linked to delays, for which ILVA cannot be held accountable, in the planned investments for the transfer of a substantial part of the production of the Sesto S. Giovanni bar mill and the Turin cold-rolling mill, call for a certain extension of the 31 March 1989 closure deadline as laid down in Article 2 (3) of Decision 89/218/ECSC, which, in respect of the Sesto S. Giovanni mill, is of a fairly short duration.
Imperative commercial reasons have brought about the need to allow some extension to the 31 March 1989 deadline for the selling off of the Lovere steel plant as laid down in Article 3 (2) of Decision 89/218/ECSC.
The release, in accordance with Article 6 (4) of Decision 89/218/ECSC, of aid segments in addition to those referred to in Article 6 (3) must be brought into line with the new calendar set for the closure and transfer conditions,","{'title': '90/89/ECSC: Commission Decision of 13 December 1989 amending Decision 89/218/ECSC concerning aid that the Italian Government proposes to grant to the public steel sector (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDecision 89/218/ECSC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. the closure deadline of '31 March 1989' for the Sesto S.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below.
(3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81, the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81.
(4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances, to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations.
(5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination.
(6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(4).
(7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6), Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

(93/526/EEC)THE  COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 92/229/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the conclusion by the European Economic Community of the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community, of the one part, and the  Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, of the other part, on trade and trade-related matters (2) and in particular Articles 37, 38 and 44 of the Interim Agreement,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES  (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 3296/92 (3), the Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in the former Czech and Slovak Federal  Republic (now the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic), Hungary, Poland and the Republic of Croatia. The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 545/93 (4), extended these duties for a period not exceeding two months.
B. DEFINITIVE MEASURES  (2) By Regulation (EEC) No 1189/93 (5), the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Hungary, Poland and the Republic of Croatia and  the Commission, by Decision 93/260/EEC (6), accepted undertakings offered in connection with this anti-dumping proceeding by exporters in the abovementioned countries.
(3) In recital 49 of Regulation (EEC) No 1189/93 the Council concluded that in the light of the negotiations of trade arrangements with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic regarding certain sensitive steel products including the seamless tubes  covered by this proceeding, it was not appropriate to take protective measures with regard to those two countries.
C. CONCLUSION OF TRADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND THE SLOVAK REPUBLIC  (4) Following Decisions of the EEC-Czech Republic and Slovak Republic Joint Committee of 28 May 1993 (7), acting in accordance with the Interim Agreement, concerning  the export of certain steel products from the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic to the Community, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 1968/93 (8) opened and provided for the administration of tariff quotas in respect of certain steel products covered  by the EEC Treaty, including the products subject to this proceeding, originating in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic imported into the Community.
(5) The Commission considers that the effect of the tariff quota system on imports of the products concerned as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1968/93 would be that the injurious consequences of the dumped imports originating in the Czech Republic and  the Slovak Republic would be eliminated.
D. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING  (6) Accordingly, it is apparent that protective measures with regard to the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic are unnecessary and that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain seamless pipes and  tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic should be terminated without anti-dumping measures being imposed.
(7) No objections to this conclusion were raised in the Advisory Committee.
(8) The complainant and the interested parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and principal considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding concerning the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic  and, did not object,","{'title': '93/526/EEC: Commission Decision of 6 October 1993 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic'}"

Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular Article 17(3)(a) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/156/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing the movement and importation from third countries of equidae (2), and in particular Article 12(1) and (4), point (a) of Article 15, Article 16(2), and the introductory phrase of Article 19 and points (a) and (b) of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2009/156/EC lays down animal health conditions for the importation into the Union of live equidae. It provides that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from those third countries that meet certain animal health requirements.
(2) Commission Decision 92/260/EEC (3) lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification requirements for the temporary admission into the Union of registered horses for a period of less than 90 days from third countries assigned to specific sanitary groups as set out in Annex I thereto. Annex II to that Decision sets out specimen animal health certificates which must accompany the animals arriving from third countries assigned to the corresponding sanitary groups.
(3) Commission Decision 93/197/EEC (4) lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification requirements for imports into the Union of registered equidae and equidae for breeding and production coming from third countries assigned to specific sanitary groups as set out in Annex I thereto. That Annex also specifies the category of equidae allowed for imports from a particular third country. Annex II to that Decision sets out specimen animal health certificates which must accompany the animals arriving from third countries assigned to the corresponding sanitary groups.
(4) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC (5) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States are to authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision.
(5) From the information available, India is free of African horse sickness in accordance with Union legislation and the last case of African horse sickness was reported in 1963. India has also been free from Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis for two years, which has never been reported in that third country. However, glanders occurs in parts of the territory of India and there is a lack of information on the occurrence of dourine.
(6) Taking into account the epidemiological situation in India as regards diseases transmissible to equidae, that third country should be assigned to Sanitary Group C as set out in Annex I to Decisions 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC respectively.
(7) Since the risk of contracting glanders is smaller for registered horses, it is appropriate to limit the introduction into the Union of equidae to registered horses only and to require that those registered horses introduced into the Union, in accordance with Decisions 92/260/EEC or 93/197/EEC, are subjected to tests for glanders and dourine. The specimen animal health certificate ‘C’ set out in the respective Annex II to those Decisions should therefore specify those tests for the introduction of those registered horses from India.
(8) Annexes I and II to Decision 92/260/EEC and to Decision 93/197/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) By letter of 31 December 2013, India informed the Commission of the establishment of an equine disease free zone at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre, Meerut Cantonment, district Meerut, division Meerut in the State of Uttar Pradesh, and provided the necessary guarantees as required in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2009/156/EC.
(10) Pending the outcome of a Commission audit mission and considering that India wishes to participate in the World Equestrian Games of the Fédération Èquestre Internationale (FEI) in Normandy in France in August 2014, the equine disease free zone established in India should be approved on a temporary basis until October 2014.
(11) The regionalisation should also include access ways for the transfer of the registered horses from the equine disease free zone to the nearest international airport, for which India has presented the Standard Operating Procedures and biosecurity measures.
(12) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

The specimen animal health certificate ‘C’ set out in the respective Annex II to those Decisions should therefore specify those tests for the introduction of those registered horses from India.\n\n((8)) Annexes I and II to Decision 92/260/EEC and to Decision 93/197/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((9)) By letter of 31 December 2013, India informed the Commission of the establishment of an equine disease free zone at the Remount and Veterinary Corps (RVC) Centre, Meerut Cantonment, district Meerut, division Meerut in the State of Uttar Pradesh, and provided the necessary guarantees as required in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 2009/156/EC.\n\n((10)) Pending the outcome of a Commission audit mission and considering that India wishes to participate in the World Equestrian Games of the Fédération Èquestre Internationale (FEI) in Normandy in France in August 2014, the equine disease free zone established in India should be approved on a temporary basis until October 2014.\n\n((11)) The regionalisation should also include access ways for the transfer of the registered horses from the equine disease free zone to the nearest international airport, for which India has presented the Standard Operating Procedures and biosecurity measures.\n\n((12)) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 92/260/EEC are amended in accordance with Annex I to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nAnnexes I and II to Decision 93/197/EEC are amended in accordance with Annex II to this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nAnnex I to Decision 2004/211/EC is amended in accordance with Annex III to this Decision.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 5,252 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 3677 of 17 December 1996;
Whereas the United Kingdom Government has submitted to the Commission on 2 August 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Thanet; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the single programming document satisfies the conditions and includes the information required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/7 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of the United Kingdom;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in ‘Horizon 2020 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)’ and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1906/2006 (1), and in particular Article 1(3)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 (2) of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (Horizon 2020) and provides for the involvement of the Union in public-private partnerships, including in joint undertakings, in key areas where research and innovation can contribute to the Union's wider competitiveness goals and help tackle societal challenges.
(2) Participation in indirect actions under Horizon 2020 should comply with Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013. However, in order to take into account the specific operating needs of joint undertakings established pursuant to Article 187 of the Treaty in the area of bio-based industries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty was delegated to the Commission for the duration of Horizon 2020.
(3) The Bio-Based Industries Joint Undertaking (BBI JU) was set up by Council Regulation (EU) No 560/2014 (3) in the area of bio-based industries for a period up to 31 December 2024 in order to implement the Joint Technology Initiative on Bio-Based Industries.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1923/2001(4); the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(7), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2000/258/EC of 20 March 2000 designating a specific institute responsible for establishing the criteria necessary for standardising the serological tests to monitor the effectiveness of rabies vaccines (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2001/296/EC of 29 March 2001 authorising laboratories to check the effectiveness of vaccination against rabies in certain domestic carnivores (2) has been substantially amended several times (3). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Decision should be codified.
(2) Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (4) provides for an alternative system to quarantine for the entry of certain domestic carnivores into the territory of certain Member States free from rabies. That system requires checks on the effectiveness of the vaccination of those animals by titration of antibodies.
(3) The AFSSA Laboratory in Nancy, France, was designated by Decision 2000/258/EC as the institute responsible for establishing the criteria necessary for standardising the serological tests to monitor the effectiveness of rabies vaccination.
(4) A proficiency testing procedure has been established for rabies antibody titration of vaccinated domestic carnivores in the context of alternative measures to quarantine.
(5) The AFSSA Laboratory, Nancy, has to operate the established proficiency testing procedure to appraise laboratories for approval to perform serological tests on certain carnivores vaccinated against rabies.
(6) Several Member States have submitted applications for approval of laboratories to perform analyses to check the effectiveness of vaccination against rabies in certain domestic carnivores.
(7) The AFSSA Laboratory, Nancy, has made an appraisal of the applications received from the Member States and sent the result of this appraisal to the Commission.
(8) The Commission can draw up a list, based on appraisal results, of laboratories authorised to carry out serological titration on carnivores vaccinated against rabies.

Whereas citrus pulp pellets originating in or consigned from Brazil were found to be contaminated by dioxins at such high levels which pose a risk to human health; whereas citrus pulp pellets are used as feed material; whereas feedingstuffs contaminated by dioxins results in dioxin contamination of food products of animal origin; whereas dioxins are classified by the relevant international organisations as carcinogenic to humans; whereas it is recommended by these relevant international organisations to take measures to reduce the intake of dioxin through diet as much as is reasonably achievable; it is, therefore, appropriate to prohibit the use of citrus pulp pellets contaminated by dioxins at unacceptable levels as feedingstuff and for the production of compound feedingstuff;
Whereas all sources of contamination by dioxins at such unacceptable levels has not been possible to be determined with sufficient certainty within the short time limits available; whereas, therefore, no sufficient guarantees exist for the moment that the possible sources of contamination have been removed from the production process of citrus pulp pellets; whereas a more complete scientific assessment of the tolerable maximum level for dioxins cannot be performed within short notice; it is therefore urgent to fix provisionally the maximum limit at the detection level (500 pg I - TEQ/kg) whilst awaiting the scientific assessment of the risk involved;

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2748/75 (3) laid down the conditions for applying protective measures in the market in cereals;
Whereas, by Regulation (EEC) No 474/87 (4), the Commission relaxed the protective measures applicable to imports of sweet potatoes for use as animal feed, previously laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1146/86 (5); whereas this relaxation consisted in defining maximum quantities up to which import licences are to be issued for products originating in, on the one hand, the People's Republic of China (600 000 tonnes) and, on the other hand, in any other third country (5 000 tonnes);
Whereas the security relating to the import licence should be increased in respect of applications giving an origin other than the People's Republic of China, in order to avoid abusive applications for licences; whereas, in the light of the limited quantities available (5 000 tonnes), any application which does not result, once the licence has been granted, in actual import during the period of validity of the licence deprives traders who have received serious guarantees from certain exporting countries from the right to import;
Whereas applications for licences stating an origin other than the People's Republic of China and accompanied by the lodging of the security laid down by this Regulation may, therefore, be submitted for a maximum quantity of 5 000 tonnes;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 79/2003(4), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 549/2003 of 27 March 2003 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 28 March 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 March 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

opening the tendering procedure for aid for private storage of olive oil
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 43(a), (d) and (j), in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the Commission may decide to authorise bodies, offering sufficient guarantees and approved by the Member States, to conclude contracts for the storage of olive oil that they market in the event of a serious disturbance on the market in certain regions of the Community.
(2) In Spain and Greece, countries that produce together more than two thirds of the olive oil produced in the EU, the average olive oil price recorded on the market during the period specified in Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 of 20 August 2008 laying down common rules for the granting of private storage aid for certain agricultural products (2), is below the level indicated in Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and that fact causes a serious disturbance on the markets of these countries. Furthermore, a serious disturbance of the market is observed in Italy, France and Portugal as the expectation of falling prices leads traders to postpone all purchases that are not immediately required.
(3) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that aid for private storage may be granted for olive oil and that the aid should be fixed by the Commission in advance or by means of a tendering procedure.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 826/2008 has established common rules for the implementation of the private storage aid scheme. Pursuant to Article 6 of that Regulation, a tendering procedure is to be opened in accordance with the detailed rules and conditions provided for in its Article 9.
(5) The global quantity up to which private storage aid can be granted should be set at a level which, according to market analysis, would contribute to the stabilisation of the market.
(6) In order to facilitate the administrative and control work relating to the conclusion of contracts, the minimum quantity of product each tender must provide for should be fixed.
(7) A security should be fixed in order to ensure that the operators fulfil their contractual obligations and that the measure will have its desired effect on the market.
(8) In the light of the evolution of the market situation in the current marketing year and the forecasts for the following marketing year, the Commission should have the possibility to decide to shorten the term of contracts which are being performed and adjust the level of aid accordingly. That possibility has to be included in the contract, as provided for by Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008.
(9) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 826/2008, the time period of notification of all valid tenders by Member States to the Commission is to be fixed.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1451/82 (2), and in particular Article 8 (4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1055/77 of 17 May 1977 on the storage and movement of products bought in by an intervention agency (3), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1146/76 of 17 May 1976 on particular and special intervention measures for cereals (4) lays down the general rules applicable in this field;
Whereas, for the 1983/84 marketing year, the market in common wheat shows an imbalance between supply and demand which has resulted in particularly large deliveries into intervention;
Whereas the accumulation of these stocks of common wheat combined with budgetary constraints threatens to create serious disturbances in the operation of the common organization of the market, particularly at intervention level;
Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, measures have been taken to facilitate the disposal on the Community market of the stocks held by the intervention agencies; whereas these measures, which have taken the form of the sale of common wheat for use in animal feedingstuffs, are due to expire on 31 March 1984;
Whereas further outlets for disposal in this sector currently exist in Denmark; whereas the stocks existing in Denmark allow for such action;
Whereas the envisaged action should produce its full effect before the beginning of the 1984/85 marketing year;
Whereas it is appropriate that this sale should take place in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1836/82 of 7 July 1982 laying down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies (5) subject, however, to certain special provisions designed to ensure that the operation is conducted in conformity with the aim pursued;
Whereas, in particular, the intended use of the cereal in question calls for the fixing of special price conditions; whereas these conditions should serve to attenuate the tension on the cereals market and prevent any deterioration; whereas, moreover, in view of the fixing of special price conditions, provision should be made for a security to be lodged in order to ensure that the operators enjoying such conditions genuinely put the cereals concerned to the use provided for;
Whereas, in order to facilitate supervision of the use of the cereals to be put up for sale by the Danish intervention agency, the minimum quantity to be covered by tenders should be fixed at 200 tonnes;
Whereas, moreover, where supervision is concerned, the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 of 30 June 1976 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 783/84 (7), are applicable; whereas, however, it is appropriate to strengthen the said detailed rules; whereas, to this effect, provision should be made for the systematic inspection of accounts as well as on-the-spot verification, possibly based on sampling; whereas, moreover, provision should be made for the cereals in question to be treated in such a manner that they can be identified;
Whereas, in view of the special use provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC) No 1687/76 should be amended;

Whereas Article 5 of Council Regulation 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3179/93 (4), provides for an aid scheme for the production of  olive oil; whereas the scheme provides for the grant of aid to oil producers whose average production is at least 500 kg of olive oil, subject in particular to the submission of proof that the oil has been processed at an approved mill; whereas the  economic aim of the said aid is achieved once the olives have been processed into oil; whereas in this case, and given the very large number of oil producers involved, the application of Article 10 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 should be clearly  specified;
Whereas the aforementioned scheme applicable to oil producers whose average production is less than 500 kg of oil provides for the grant of a flat-rate aid based on the number of trees in production and therefore not linked to the quantity actually  produced; whereas the processing of olives into oil occurs in the producer Member States on average during the month of January;
Whereas the flat-rate aid per hectare provided for by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2019/93 of 19 July 1993 introducing specific measures for the smaller Aegean islands concerning certain agricultural products (5) aims in particular to maintain production  potential and to preserve the countryside and the natural environment;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (3) lays down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies;
Whereas, with a view to supplying the markets of the ACP countries, favoured partners of the Community, significant quantities of common wheat are required; whereas these markets are usually supplied on the basis of annual contracts to ensure stable  prices for the ACP countries over a long period; whereas it is therefore necessary to issue a specific invitation to tender to ensure that users in these countries have access to common wheat of breadmaking quality in the 1993/94 marketing year under  conditions appropriate to the highly competitive situation on the world market;
Whereas the French and German intervention agencies hold significant stocks of common wheat of high breadmaking quality; whereas part of the wheat coming from the intervention stocks held by the aforementioned agencies should therefore be resold to the  ACP countries so as to meet their quantitative and qualitative needs; whereas to avoid encroaching on the economic effects of the following marketing year, the common wheat successfully tendered for must be sent to the countries of destination by 31  August 1994 at the latest;
Whereas the specific nature of the operation and the accounting position of the common wheat in question require greater flexibility in the mechanisms and obligations governing the resale of intervention stocks and also require the exclusion of any  refund or monthly increase; whereas special procedures must be laid down to ensure that the operations and their monitoring are properly effected; whereas to that end provision should be made for a security lodgment scheme which ensures that the aims  are met while avoiding excessive costs for the operators; whereas derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93;

of 20 December 2001
relating to honey
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Whereas:
(1) Certain vertical directives relating to foods should be simplified in order to take account only of the essential requirements to be met by the products they cover in order that those products may move freely within the internal market, in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council held in Edinburgh on 11 and 12 December 1992, confirmed by those of the European Council in Brussels on 10 and 11 December 1993.
(2) Council Directive 74/409/EEC of 22 July 1974 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to honey(4) was justified by the fact that differences between national laws on the definition of honey, the various types of honey and the characteristics required of it could result in conditions of unfair competition likely to mislead consumers, and thereby have a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the common market.
(3) Directive 74/409/EEC and its subsequent amendments consequently established definitions, specified the different types of honey which could be placed on the market under appropriate names, laid down common rules on composition and determined the main labelling information so as to ensure the free movement of these products within the Community.
(4) For the sake of clarity Directive 74/409/EEC should be recast, in order to make rules on the conditions for the production and marketing of honey more accessible and to bring it into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs, particularly legislation on labelling, contaminants and methods of analysis.
(5) The general food-labelling rules laid down in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5) should apply subject to certain conditions. In view of the close link between the quality of honey and its origin, it is indispensable that full information on those matters be available so that the consumer is not misled regarding the quality of the product. The particular consumer interests as regards the geographical characteristics of honey and full transparency in this regard necessitate that the country of origin where the honey has been harvested should be included in the labelling.
(6) No pollen or other individual ingredient of honey is to be removed, unless that is inevitable when organic and inorganic foreign materials are removed. That process may be carried out by filtering. Where such filtering leads to the removal of a significant quantity of pollen, the consumer must be correctly informed to that effect by means of an appropriate indication on the label.
(7) Honey the name of which includes indications concerning floral, vegetable, regional, territorial or topographical origin or specific quality criteria may not have filtered honey added to it. So that the transparency of the market may be improved, the labelling of filtered honeys and baker's honeys must be mandatory for every transaction on the bulk market.
(8) As the Commission stressed in its communication to the European Parliament and the Council of 24 June 1994 on European apiculture, the Commission may adopt methods of analysis to ensure compliance with the compositional characteristics and additional specific statements for all honey marketed in the Community.
(9) It is desirable to take account of the work achieved on a new Codex standard for honey, adjusted, as appropriate, to the specific requirements of the Community.
(10) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality established by Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of laying down common definitions and rules for the products concerned and bringing the provisions into line with general Community legislation on foodstuffs cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the nature of this Directive, be better achieved by the Community. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the said objective.
(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6).
(12) To avoid creating new barriers to free movement, Member States should refrain from adopting, for the products in question, national provisions not provided for by this Directive,","{'title': 'Council Directive 2001/110/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to honey', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Directive shall apply to the products defined in Annex I.

adopting protective measures with regard to the import of strawberries originating in Spain
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 379 (2) thereof,
Whereas on 30 April 1987 France requested the Commission to take protective action with regard to imports of strawberries originating in Spain for sale on the French market; whereas that request was supplemented on 5 May 1987 by additional information;
Whereas, despite almost stable production, production prices on the French strawberry market, in particular during April 1987, have been markedly lower than the levels which they reached in the same month in 1985 and 1986;
Whereas this situation is due to the very marked increase in imports of strawberries originating in Spain; whereas such imports, which have increased by more than 50 % by comparison with the average for the two previous years, are being sold at prices which are generally lower than in previous years and which have led to a decline in French market prices;
Whereas, in view of supplies of the Spanish product, a further marked decrease in the prices on the French market is to be feared, along with increased difficulties of disposing of the French product;
Whereas the brief assessment of the market situation set out above leads to the conclusion that the French strawberry market is experiencing, owing to the imports originating in Spain, serious disturbances which may endanger the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas in these circumstances protective measures should be adopted;
Whereas, to that end, imports into France of strawberries originating in Spain should be limited for as long as is strictly necessary to eliminate the aforesaid disturbances; whereas, however, provision should be made to discontinue such measures where a system is applied for voluntary restraint on exports of Spanish strawberries to the French market;

Those areas are listed in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC. That Decision is to apply until 31 December 2011.
(2) Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 have last occurred in poultry in the Union in Romania in March 2010 and the virus has been detected in a wild bird in Bulgaria in April 2010. According to available information, there are currently no outbreaks of that disease in the Union. It is therefore appropriate to remove Romania from the list set out in the Annex to Decision 2006/415/EC.
(3) The measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC have proven to be very effective and the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union of the zones that the competent authority has placed under restrictions has increased transparency and trust of non-affected Member States and third countries in the measures taken.
(4) In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 is still present in several third countries and continues therefore to pose a threat to animal and human health in the Union. The period of application of Decision 2006/415/EC should therefore be extended.
(5) In September 2011 an external evaluation of the Union’s emergency response network has started. The evaluation aims at assessing the effectiveness of the network. That evaluation is to be completed by August 2012. The results of the evaluation will be taken into account in a possible review of the measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 19, repellents and attractants, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) Austria was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 23 February 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 24 September 2010, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as attractants and containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate in Annex I to that Directive.
(6) It also appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as attractants and containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate may be expected to present only low risk to humans, animals and the environment and to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC, in particular with regard to the use which was examined and detailed in the assessment report, i.e. in traps for indoor use containing a maximum of 2 mg of the active substance. It is therefore appropriate to include (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate in Annex IA to Directive 98/8/EC.
(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States, when granting product authorisations, assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to the environmental compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(8) In the light of the assumptions made during the evaluation, it is appropriate to require that (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate is not applied where food or feed is stored unless the food or feed packaging is closed or re-closed. Labels should therefore indicate that biocidal products containing (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate are not to be used in spaces where un-packaged food or feed is kept.
(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '9.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 34/45', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2011/11/EU\nof 8 February 2011\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include (Z,E)-tetradeca-9,12-dienyl acetate as an active substance in Annexes I and IA thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 41 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 428/2008 of 8 May 2008 on determining the intervention centres for cereals (2) sets out the intervention centres for each Member State by cereal type, with the exception of durum wheat.
(2) The Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1173/2009 (3) lists the intervention centres for durum wheat and rice referred to in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 670/2009 (4).
(3) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 of 11 December 2009 laying down common detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards buying-in and selling of agricultural products under public intervention (5) sets out the conditions to be complied with, from the 2010/2011 marketing year onwards, for the designation and approval of cereal intervention centres and their storage premises. Among these conditions, Article 3(1)(a)(i) of that Regulation provides that each cereal intervention centre must have a minimum storage capacity of 20 000 tonnes.
(4) With effect from 1 July 2010, Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009 repeals Regulation (EC) No 670/2009 with regard to cereals.
(5) With effect from 1 July 2010, the cereal intervention centres designated pursuant to Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 must comply with the conditions laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009. It is therefore appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 428/2008 and to amend Regulation (EC) No 1173/2009.
(6) In accordance with Article 55(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1272/2009, the Member States have sent the Commission a list of intervention centres for actual designation and a list of the storage premises attached to those centres which they have approved as fulfilling the minimum standards required by Community legislation. In cases where cereal production levels are low, or where estimates do not indicate any cereal sectors generating surpluses and intervention has not been used for a significant period, some Member States have not reported any cereal intervention centres.
(7) In order to ensure that the public intervention scheme works efficiently, the Commission should designate intervention centres on the basis of their geographical location and publish a list of the storage premises attached thereto, together with all the information required by the operators involved in public intervention.

","Commission Decision
of 22 May 2003
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact disks originating in India
(2003/371/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 17 May 2002, the Commission announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of recordable compact disks (CD-Rs) originating in India.
(2) The proceeding was initiated as a result of a complaint lodged in April 2002 by the Committee of CD-R manufacturers (CECMA), acting on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of CD-Rs. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the said product and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(3) There are definitive anti-dumping measures currently in force on imports of CD-Rs originating in Taiwan (Council Regulation (EC) No 1050/2002(4)). A parallel anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Community of the same product originating in India was initiated by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(5) on the same date of the initiation of the anti-dumping proceeding referred to in recital 1.
(4) The Commission officially advised the applicant and the other known Community producers, the exporting producer, importers, users and suppliers known to be concerned as well as the representatives of India of the initiation of the proceeding. The parties directly concerned were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.
(5) The exporting producer in India, as well as the applicant and other Community producers, importers, consumers association and suppliers, made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the above time limit and indicated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.
(6) Certain parties contended that the applicant Community producers did not fulfil the requirements of Article 5(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (basic Regulation) and that the initiation of the investigation was not warranted. In this respect, it should be noted that both statutory pre-initiation thresholds, namely the 25 % and 50 % thresholds of Article 5(4), were met and, therefore, the investigation could be initiated.
(7) The Commission sought, by means of questionnaires sent to all known parties, and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping, injury and Community interest. In this regard, the Commission carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies:
(a) Exporting producer in India:
- Moser Baer India Ltd., New Delhi, India;
(b) Producers in the Community:
- Computer Support Italcard SRL, Milan, Italy,
- C.D.A DatentrĂ¤ger Albrechts GmbH, Albrechts, Germany,
- CPO Magnetic Products BV, Oosterhout, the Netherlands,
- Fuji Magnetics GmbH, Kleve, Germany,
- Mitsui Advanced Media SA, Ensisheim, France,
- MPO Media SAS, Averton, France,
- TDK Recording Media Europe SA, Bascharage, Luxembourg,
- Prime Disc Technologies GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany,
- IMAG Optical Storage Ltd, Limerick, Ireland,
- Multimedia Info-Tech Ltd, Belfast, Northern Ireland;
(c) Suppliers in the Community:
- Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany,
- Steag Hamatech, Sternenfels, Germany,
(8) The investigation of dumping and injury covered the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002 (investigation period or IP). The examination of trends relevant for the assessment of injury covered the period from 1 January 1998 to the end of the investigation period.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT
1. Product under consideration
(9) The product under consideration is recordable compact discs (CD-Rs) currently classifiable under CN code ex 8523 90 00.
(10) A CD-R is a polycarbonate disc, which is coated with a layer of dye, a layer of reflective material such as gold or silver and a protective layer. Recording on such a disk can be done only once and therefore the disc is said to be of the type WORM (Write Once Read Many). The disc is an optical storage medium for digital data or music. Recording is realised by exposing the dye-layer to an infrared laser beam in a CD-R recorder.
CD-Rs can be distinguished according to the type of data stored (data CD-R versus music CD-R), the storage capacity, the reflective metal layer (mainly silver) and whether or not the CD-R is printed upon.
The product is also sold in different qualities and comes on the market in different types of packaging of which the most frequently encountered are regular or slim jewel cases containing one CD-R, shrink-wrapped spindles of 10 to 100 CD-Rs, cake-boxes of 10 to 100 CD-Rs, envelopes containing one CD-R packed in cellophane, or in a carton or paper sleeve, etc.
Although the use and the quality of the various types of CD-Rs sold may differ, this does not entail any significant differences in the basic physical and technical characteristics of the different types. They are therefore considered as one product for the purpose of this investigation.
2. Like product
(11) The investigation showed that CD-Rs produced and sold on the domestic market of India have similar basic physical and technical characteristics and uses compared with that exported from this country to the Community. Similarly, CD-Rs manufactured by the applicant and other Community producers and sold on the Community market have similar basic physical and technical characteristics and uses when compared to these exported to the Community from the country in question.
(12) Consequently, CD-Rs sold on the domestic market of India and exported to the Community as well as CD-Rs produced and sold in the Community are considered as a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
C. DUMPING
(13) The investigation has shown that Moser Baer India Ltd. is the sole exporting producer of the product concerned in India.
1. Normal value
(14) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission first examined whether the domestic sales of CD-Rs to independent customers by the sole exporting producer were representative, i.e. whether the total volume of such sales was equal to or greater than 5 % of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to the Community.
(15) This assessment revealed that the exporting producer had representative sales of CD-Rs on the domestic market during the IP.
(16) The Commission considered domestically sold and exported product types, which had similar storage capacity, metal layer, printing, quality and uses, as being directly comparable.
(17) Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the total domestic sales volume of that type during the IP represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the comparable product type exported to the Community.
(18) The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of the exporting producer could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation.
This was done by establishing the proportion of domestic sales to independent customers, of each exported product type, sold at a loss on the domestic market during the IP. For those product types where more than 80 % by volume of sales on the domestic market were not below unit costs, and where the weighted average sales price was equal to or higher than the weighted average production cost, normal value, by product type, was calculated as the weighted average of all domestic sales prices of the type in question.
(19) For all types exported to the Community, domestic sales were found to have been made in the ordinary course of trade. Normal value was, therefore, based for the corresponding product type on the actual prices paid or payable, by independent customers in the domestic market of India, during the IP, as set out in Article 2(1) of the basic Regulation.
(20) Where necessary, the manufacturing costs and the selling, general and administrative (SG& A) expenses reported were corrected before being used in the ordinary course of trade test.
2. Export price
(21) Certain exports of the product under consideration by the exporting producer were made directly to independent customers in the Community and consequently the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of export prices actually paid or payable.
(22) The exporting producer also sold the product concerned to related parties in the Community. For these exports, the export price was established in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation, on the basis of prices at which the imported products were first resold to an independent buyer. For this purpose, adjustments were made to take account of all costs, including duties and taxes, incurred between importation and resale, and of profits normally accruing, so that a reliable export price could be established.
3. Comparison
(23) The comparison between normal value and export price for the exporting producer concerned was made on an ex-factory basis. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between the normal value and the export price, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation. In this respect, allowances for differences in transport costs, ocean freight and insurance costs, handling, loading and ancillary costs, packing costs, credit costs and commissions have been granted where applicable and justified.
(24) The exporting producer claimed a special adjustment for differences in the level of trade pursuant to Article 2(10)(d) of the basic Regulation. The company argued that its domestic market is formed mainly by distributors and retailers while in the export market there are either OEM (i.e. original equipment manufacturers) sales or sales through distributors. In view of the absence of retailers in the export market, the exporting producer claimed an adjustment on sales prices to retailers quantified at the level of a weighted average price difference between sales prices to retailers and those to distributors in the domestic market.
(25) It is noted that the exporting producer did not claim an adjustment which may arise in OEM sales. Furthermore, it has not shown that there are differences in functions of the seller for sales in the domestic market to retailers and to distributors which could affect the comparability of export price and normal value. More importantly, the investigation has shown that the vast majority of its exports to the Community concerned OEM sales, whilst such sales did not exist in the domestic market. The majority of the domestic sales were sales to distributors and only a minor proportion were sales to retailers. The request for a level of trade adjustment thus rests on the assumption that the distribution level on the domestic side is comparable to the level of OEM sales on the export side. In view of the conclusions reached in recital 27, it was decided not to pursue this matter further and consequently no adjustment was made for the alleged differences in the level of trade.
4. Dumping margin
(26) Pursuant to Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average normal value by product type was compared with the weighted average export price by product type.
(27) The calculation has shown no dumping for Moser Baer India Ltd. Given that this is the sole exporting producer in India, and pursuant to Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation, the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning CD-Rs originating in India should be terminated without the imposition of measures.
D. INJURY
(28) In view of the conclusions concerning dumping, it was not considered necessary to analyse injury, causality and Community interest aspects arising from the investigation since this would not alter the conclusions reached.
E. CONCLUSION
(29) All parties concerned were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the termination of the anti-dumping proceeding would be based. They were granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure. Representations received further to the disclosure did not however provide any new elements which could affect the above findings.
(30) In particular, CECMA claimed that there was a particular market situation and the normal value should have been constructed because the domestic sales did not permit a proper comparison since the sole exporting producer operates an Export Oriented Unit which received countervailable subsidies. CECMA also claimed that the ""strategy"" of the exporting producer to sell only low quality CD-Rs in its domestic market must be regarded as a particular market situation.
(31) As set out in recitals 14 to 20 above, the investigation has shown that the domestic sales were sufficiently representative and in the ordinary course of trade. The quality of CD-Rs was taken into account when comparing domestically sold and exported product types. No particular market situation was established, which could allow the use of constructed normal value in accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation. The existence of any countervailable subsidies is the subject of the parallel anti-subsidy investigation and has not affected the establishment of normal value.
(32) In view of the findings set out above, the Commission considers that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of CD-Rs originating in India should be terminated,",{'title': '2003/371/EC: Commission Decision of 22 May 2003 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of recordable compact disks originating in India'}

(4) Within the period of 3 months from those publications, a number of companies indicated an interest in taking over the role of participant for the substances and product-types concerned. However, those companies subsequently failed to submit a complete dossier.
(5) Pursuant to Article 12(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the substances and product types concerned should therefore not be included in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 (2),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the European Union of woven fabrics of synthetic filament yarn containing 85 % or more by weight of textured and/or non-textured polyester filament, dyed (including dyed white) or printed, originating in the People’s Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes ex 5407 51 00, 5407 52 00, 5407 54 00, ex 5407 61 10, 5407 61 30, 5407 61 90, ex 5407 69 10 and ex 5407 69 90 (‘the product concerned’).
(2) Given the large number of cooperating parties, a sample of Chinese exporting producers was selected during the investigation which led to the imposition of the measures.
(3) The sampled companies were attributed the individual duty rates established during the investigation. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (MET), in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(c) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (3), were attributed the weighted average duty of 14,1 % which was established for the sampled companies which were granted MET. The cooperating non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (IT), in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the same Regulation, received the weighted average duty of 37,1 % established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A countrywide duty of 56,2 % was imposed on all other companies.
(4) Following an anti-absorption reinvestigation pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1087/2007 (4) increased the countrywide duty to 74,8 %. In addition, Chinese exporting producers with individual duty rates that did not cooperate in the reinvestigation were attributed higher anti-dumping duties in accordance with the provisions of Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96.
(5) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 gives the possibility to Chinese exporting producers which meet the four criteria set out in that Article to be granted the same treatment as the one set out in recital 3 for the cooperating companies not included in the sample (‘New Exporting Producer Treatment’ or ‘NEPT’).
2.   NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS’ REQUEST
(6) One group of companies consisting of two related companies, namely AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, and Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd (‘the applicant’), requested to be granted NEPT.
(7) An examination has been carried out to determine whether the applicant fulfils the criteria for being granted NEPT as set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, by verifying that:
(a) it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the investigation period on which the measures are based (1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004) (‘the first criterion’),
(b) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (‘the second criterion’),
(c) it has actually exported to the European Union the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of the product concerned to the European Union (‘the third criterion’),
(d) it operates under market economy conditions defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or, alternatively, that it fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation (‘the fourth criterion’).
(8) Questionnaires were sent to the applicant asking it to supply evidence to demonstrate that it met the first, second and third criteria.
(9) Since the fourth criterion implies that the applicants submit a claim for MET and/or IT, the Commission sent MET and IT claim forms to the applicant. The applicant requested MET pursuant to Article 2(7) of the basic Regulation.
(10) Briefly, and for ease of reference only, the MET criteria are set out in summarised form below:
(a) business decisions and costs are made in response to market signals and without significant State interference; and costs of major inputs substantially reflect market values;
(b) firms have one clear set of basic accounting records which are independently audited in line with international accounting standards (5) and are applied for all purposes;
(c) there are no significant distortions carried over from the former non-market economy system;
(d) bankruptcy and property laws guarantee legal certainty and stability;
(e) exchange rate conversions are carried out at market rates.
(11) Exporting producers fulfilling the criteria mentioned in recital 7 may, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, be granted either the 14,1 % duty rate applicable to companies to which MET was granted in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, or the weighted average duty rate of 37,1 % applicable to companies to which IT was granted in accordance with Article 9(5) of the same Regulation.
(12) The European Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of determining whether the four criteria set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 had been fulfilled. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies:
— AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, Jiaxing,
— Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd, Jiaxing.
3.   FINDINGS
(13) The applicant has provided sufficient evidence to prove that it meets the four criteria mentioned in recital 7. The applicant in fact could prove that (i) it did not export the product concerned to the European Union during the period 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, (ii) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, (iii) it actually exported a significant quantity of the product concerned to the European Union starting from the year 2008, (iv) it fulfils all the requirements for MET and can therefore be granted an individual duty in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, the applicant could be granted the weighted average duty rate applicable to cooperating companies not included in the sample which have been granted MET (i.e. 14,1 %) in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005, and should be added to the list of exporting producers in Article 1(2) of that Regulation.
4.   MODIFICATION OF THE LIST OF COMPANIES BENEFITING FROM INDIVIDUAL DUTY RATES
(14) In consideration of the findings of the investigation as indicated in recital 13, it is concluded that the companies AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co. Ltd, and Jiaxing E. Boselli Textile Trading Co. Ltd should be added to the list of individual companies mentioned under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 with a duty rate of 14,1 %.
(15) The applicant and the Union industry have been informed of the findings of the investigation and have had the opportunity to submit their comments. No additional information was brought forward permitting to lead to any different conclusion for the applicant,","{'header': '29.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 107/6', 'title': 'IMPLEMENTING REGULATION OF THE COUNCIL (EU) No 364/2010\nof 26 April 2010\namending Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of certain finished polyester filament fabrics originating in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1487/2005 shall be amended by adding the following companies in the table of companies with individual duty rates:\nCompany\nDefinitive anti-dumping duty\nTARIC additional code\n‘AlbaChiara Printing and Dyeing (Jiaxing) Co.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 502/2002 of 21 March 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 22 March 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 21 March 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 141, 24.6.1995, p. 12.\n\n(3) OJ L 145, 27.6.1968, p. 12.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 21 March 2002 fixing the representative prices and additional import duties to imports of molasses in the sugar sector\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 7 May 1991  on the animal health and production fund in Belgium  (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)  (91/538/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 21 thereof,

Having given formal notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments in accordance with Article 93 (2) of the Treaty (5), and having regard to these comments,
Whereas:
I
(1) At the end of 1986 the Commission decided to scrutinize all set-purpose charges levied in the Member States in agriculture and fisheries and the allocation of those charges, in particular as aid.
A standard letter was accordingly sent to each Member State in 1987 in order to obtain the information required.
By letter of 7 June 1988 the Belgian authorities responded to that request. By letter of 10 April 1989, the Commission asked the Belgian authorities to provide additional information, which they did by letter of 6 July 1989.
(2) The measures in question were introduced by the Law of 24 March 1987 on animal health, and in particular Article 32 (2) thereof, and the Royal Decree of 11 December 1987 on obligatory contributions to the animal health and production fund.
The purpose of the fund is to contribute towards the financing of compensation, subsidies and other benefits connected with combating animal diseases and improving animal hygiene and health and the quality of livestock and livestock products. The fund  is financed in part through compulsory contributions. The level of contributions was set by the Royal Decree of 11 December 1987.
(3) Pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of that Decree, the contributions are:
- a compulsory contribution of Bfr 315 per slaughtered bovine animal, Bfr 105 per slaughtered calf and Bfr 20 per slaughtered pig, to be borne by the slaughterhouses,
- a compulsory contribution of Bfr 315 per live bovine animal exported, Bfr 105 per live calf exported and Bfr 20 per live pig exported, to be borne by the exporters (6).
(4) At present money is paid from the fund towards programmes to:
- eradicate classical swine fever,
- combat brucellosis.
II
(5) By letter of 20 October 1989, the Commission notified the Belgian Government that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty with regard to this aid in view of the fact that it is partly financed through  obligatory contributions which are also imposed on animals imported from other Member States. Moreover, it took the view that the charges must be considered as discriminatory internal taxes within the meaning of Article 95 of the Treaty as they only  benefit national producers.
In accordance with this procedure, the Commission gave notice to the Belgian Government to submit its comments.
The Commission also gave notice to the other Member States and interested parties other than Member States to submit their comments.
The comments received from the other interested parties were notified to the Belgian Government by letter No 10546 of 12 April 1991.
III
(6) By letter of 20 November 1989, the Belgian authorities informed the Commission:
(a) that it is unfair to claim that collection of the charge is deferred to a stage which necessarily follows the crossing of the border by the imported product, given that the operative event is slaughter and that therefore the importer of the live  animal who sells the animal to a Belgian operator is not subject to the charge;
(b) that even though the charge is imposed on imports, the collection of the charge is compatible with Article 95 of the Treaty and decisions of the Court of Justice since the contribution is collected at the abattoir irrespective of origin. In its  Judgment of 31 May 1979 in Case 132/78 (7), the Court of Justice laid down that, in order to relate to a general system of internal dues and thus not come within the application of the provisions prohibiting charges having an effect equivalent to  customs duties, the charge to which an imported product is subject must impose the same duty on national products and identical imported products at the same marketing stage and the chargeable event giving rise to the duty must also be identical in the  case of both products. The charge on slaughter fulfils these conditions perfectly;
(c) that, with regard to the interpretation of its Judgment in Case 47/69 (8), the Court of Justice gave the following as grounds for its decision:
'In its appraisal the Commission must therefore take into account all those factors which directly or indirectly characterize the measure in question, that is, not only aid, properly so-called, for selected national activities, but also the indirect aid  which may be constituted both by the method of financing and by the close connection which makes the amount of aid dependent upon the revenue from the charge . . . By automatically increasing the amount of national aid in proportion to the increase in  the revenue from the charge and more especially the revenue from the charge levied on foreign products, the method of financing in question has a protective effect which goes beyond aid properly so-called.'
The charge imposed on the slaughter of imported animals introduced by the Royal Decree in question cannot be condemned on the above grounds.
The level of the compensation and subsidies paid to producers as part of the campaign against animal diseases is not dependent on the revenue from contributions.
It should be noted in this respect that:
(i) the legislative and ministerial provisions do not make the amount of aid dependent on the revenue from contributions but on health control requirements and on the value of the slaughtered animals;
(ii) under Article 32 (2) of the Law of 24 March 1987, the revenue from contributions forms only a part of the financing of the animal health and production fund, with an important part of financing coming from the budget of the Ministry for  Agriculture;
(d) that the control of animal diseases in Belgium is of benefit to producers from other Member States, in particular from regions bordering on Belgium; improvements in the health of Belgian livestock increase the protection of livestock in neighbouring  countries; imported animals run less risk of health problems because of improvements in the health of Belgian livestock.
(7) By a Royal Decree of 23 November 1990, which was not notified to the Commission, the provisions on the collection of the obligatory contributions for the fund were extended from 1 January 1991.
IV
(8) The Belgian authorities have not fulfilled their obligation pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty by failing to submit a draft of the measures to the Commission.
The aid, financed by compulsory contributions and a State contribution, is likely to affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty by favouring the sectors concerned.
(9) However, the health measures undertaken by the fund could benefit from the provisions of Article 92 (3) (c). The programme for the eradication of classical swine fever was introduced in application of Council Directive 80/1095/EEC (9), as last  amended by Directive 87/487/EEC (10), and the programme to combat brucellosis was introduced to comply with Council Directive 64/432/EEC (11), as last amended by Directive 91/13/EEC (12).
(10) However, they cannot be considered eligible since the aid is partly financed through charges imposed on products imported from other Member States.
In accordance with the decisions of the Court of Justice, the financing of a State aid by means of a compulsory charge is a basic element in that aid and, when such aid is evaluated, both the aid and its method of financing should be examined having  regard to Community law.
From this viewpoint and even though the aid is compatible as regards both its form and its objectives, according to the Court of Justice in Case 47/69, the financing of the aid by parafiscal charges which are also levied on imported Community products  has a protective effect which goes beyond aid properly so-called.
This protectionist effect exists irrespective of the proportion of the aid financed through the obligatory contribution; the effect exists even though, as the Belgian authorities affirm, the contribution accounts for only a part of the financing of the  aid concerned. This protectionist effect also remains even if, as the authorities insist, the amount of aid is not linked to the revenue from the charge. In the absence of the said contribution there would either be less money available to finance the  aid or else the State contribution or the contribution imposed on animals reared in Belgium would have to increase.
(11) Furthermore, the principle that the charge is not collected on imported products should be extended to the slaughtering stage so that the exemption at the frontier does not simply involve a transfer of the payment of the charge on imported products  to subsequent stages.
(12) Owing to the fact that Directive 64/432/EEC on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine has the main aim of imposing on Member States dispatching live-stock (cattle and swine) the obligation to ensure  compliance with a series of health measures intended to ensure in particular that exported livestock does not constitute a source of propagation of contagious diseases, in practical terms the abovementioned charges serve to finance aid for Belgian  stockfarmers.
Finally, it should be noted that all the Member States have committed themselves to eradication programmes pursuant to the abovementioned Directives.
The assertion by the Belgian authorities that the health measures benefit stockfarmers and traders in neighbouring countries is valid for all Member States who are obliged by these Community provisions to introduce eradication measures. Such measures  cannot therefore justify imposing a charge on animals imported from other Member States to finance health measures in Belgium.
(13) Furthermore, such compulsory contributions levied on imported animals at the slaughter stage should be considered as discriminatory internal taxes within the meaning of Article 95 of the Treaty as they benefit national producers alone.
According to the Court of Justice (13), internal taxation is of such a nature as to impose a heavier burden on products from other Member States than on domestic products if it is used exclusively or principally to finance aid for the sole benefit of  domestic products.
The arguments put forward by the Belgian authorities with regard to the conformity of the levying of compulsory contributions on slaughter with Article 95 of the Treaty cannot therefore be accepted given that they take no account of the fact that  importers cannot benefit from the health measures which are partly financed by the revenue from the charge.
(14) The aid financed through the animal health and production fund described in recital I cannot therefore be considered compatible with the common market in view of its method of financing and must therefore be discontinued,","{'title': '91/538/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 May 1991 on the animal health and production fund in Belgium (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aid granted by Belgium in the beef and veal and pork sectors, financed through the compulsory contribution provided for in the Royal Decree of 11 December 1987 on obligatory contributions to the animal health and production fund, are  incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty and must be discontinued in so far as the compulsory contribution is also imposed on products imported from other Member States at the stage of slaughter.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nBelgium shall inform the Commission, within two months of the notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to ensure compliance with this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.

This method disregards the variations in the internal friction of the roller(s), which are due to the load applied by the vehicle.\n\n3. According to this method the power absorbed is determined on the basis of the deceleration times of the roller(s). The difference between the deceleration time of the driven roller and that of the free roller can be disregarded in the case of two-roller dynamometers, i.e. the time to be taken into consideration is that of the driven roller.\n\n4. The following procedure will be used:      4.1. Use a flywheel or any other means of simulating the inertia of the mass of the vehicle. Select for this purpose the inertial mass with which the dynamometer is most commonly used.\n\n4.2. Bring the dynamometer up to speed by placing the vehicle on the rollers, or by any other method.\n\n4.3. A fifth wheel, revolution counter or any other suitable device may be used to measure the speed(s) of the roller(s).\n\n4.4. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of 50 km/h and apply a suitable power to the dynamometer in accordance with the table in point 4.2 of Annex III.\n\n4.5. Note the power indicated (Pi).\n\n4.6. Bring the roller(s) to a speed of at least 60 km/h.\n\n4.7. Disengage the device used to bring the dynamometer up to speed (there must be no vehicle on the roller(s)).\n\n4.8. Note the times taken for the speed of the roller(s) to decrease from 55 to 45 km/h.\n\n4.9. The power Pa is to be calculated using the formula: >PIC FILE= ""T0013477"">\n\nwhere:\n\nPa = power absorbed by the dynamometer in kW,\n\nM1 = equivalent inertia of the driven roller in kg,\n\nV1 = initial speed in m/s (55 km/h = 15 728 m/s),\n\nV2 = final speed in m/s (45 km/h = 12 750 m/s),\n\nt = time needed by the roller(s) to slow down from 55 to 45 km/h.\n\n4.10.

amending Annex E to Council Directive 92/65/EEC as regards the model health certificates for animals from holdings and animals, semen, ova and embryos from approved bodies, institutes or centres
(notified under document C(2012) 860)

(2012/112/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 22 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in the Union in animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to the animal health requirements laid down in certain specific Union acts. In addition, Part 1 of Annex E to that Directive sets out the specimen health certificate for trade in animals from holdings (ungulates, birds, lagomorphs, dogs, cats and ferrets), while Part 3 of that Annex sets out the specimen health certificate for trade in animals, semen, embryos and ova from approved bodies, institutes or centres.
(2) Article 6(3) of Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in suidae other than those covered by Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (2). It provides, inter alia, that where suidae do not come from a brucellosis-free herd in accordance with Directive 64/432/EEC, they must, in the 30 days prior to their dispatch, have undergone with negative results a test designed to show the absence of antibodies to brucellosis. In the interests of consistency of Union legislation, the specimen health certificate set out in Part 1 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended to include a specific reference to that requirement.
(3) Commission Decision 2007/598/EC of 28 August 2007 concerning measures to prevent the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza to other captive birds kept in zoos and approved bodies, institutes or centres in the Member States (3) approves preventive vaccination plans against that disease in certain Member States.
(4) Point 4(b) of Annex II to Decision 2007/598/EC provides that birds vaccinated against avian influenza kept in zoos that are not approved in accordance with Directive 92/65/EEC may be moved to other Member States, after authorisation by the Member State of destination, provided that they meet the requirements set out in that Decision and they are accompanied by a health certificate, as laid down in Part 1 of Annex E to that Directive, specifying that they are conform to Decision 2007/598/EC and are vaccinated against avian influenza on a specified date.
(5) However, birds as referred to in Article 7 of Directive 92/65/EEC are not required to be accompanied by a health certificate, as set out in Part 1 of Annex E thereto when traded within the Union, but must be accompanied by a self-certification by the operator in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive, or in the case of psittacidae by a commercial document signed by the official veterinarian or by the veterinarian responsible for the holding.
(6) It should be therefore clarified that the health certificate set out in Part 1 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC is only required to accompany birds that are vaccinated against avian influenza and come from a holding on which vaccination against avian influenza was carried out during the past 12 months. Therefore, the specimen health certificate set out in Part 1 of that Annex should be amended to include a reference to such vaccination.
(7) Article 10 of Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in dogs, cats and ferrets. It provides, inter alia, that they must satisfy the relevant requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC (4).
(8) Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that until 31 December 2011, dogs and cats entering Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom from other Member States are to be vaccinated and subject to a pre-entry rabies blood testing in accordance with national rules.
(9) In addition, Article 16 of that Regulation provides that until 31 December 2011, Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as regards echinococcosis, and Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom as regards ticks, may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with certain additional national requirements.
(10) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1152/2011 of 14 July 2011 supplementing Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards preventive health measures for the control of Echinococcus multilocularis infection in dogs (5) was adopted in order to ensure the continuous health protection of Ireland, Malta, Finland and the United Kingdom from Echinococcus multilocularis. It is to apply from 1 January 2012.
(11) The reference to Articles 6 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 included in the specimen health certificate set out in Part 1 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be deleted and replaced, as regards dogs, by a reference to Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1152/2011.
(12) Part 1 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) Article 13 of Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in animals of species susceptible to the diseases listed in Annexes A and B thereto and in semen, ova and embryos of such animals consigned to and from bodies, institutes or centres approved in accordance with Annex C thereto.
(14) Semen, ova and embryos of certain animal species can be frozen and stored for a long time and therefore donor animal might no longer be available on the day the health certificate is issued. It is therefore necessary to amend the specimen health certificate set out in Part 3 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC to state that the donor animal was found to be healthy and free from clinical disease either on day of collection or the date of issuing of the health certificate.
(15) Point 4(a) of Annex II to Decision 2007/598/EC provides that birds vaccinated against avian influenza kept in approved bodies, institutes or centres including zoos may only be moved to approved bodies, institutes or centres including zoos in other Member States provided that they meet the requirements set out in that Decision and they are accompanied by a health certificate as laid down in Part 3 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC stating that the birds have been vaccinated against avian influenza in conformity to Commission Decision 2006/474/EC (6). As that Decision has since been repealed and replaced by Decision 2007/598/EC, that reference should be replaced by a reference to Decision 2007/598/EC.
(16) Part 3 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(17) Directive 92/65/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(18) To avoid any disruption of trade, the use of health certificates issued in accordance with Part 1 and Part 3 of Annex E to Directive 92/65/EEC, before the amendments introduced by this Decision, should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.2.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 50/51', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 February 2012\namending Annex E to Council Directive 92/65/EEC as regards the model health certificates for animals from holdings and animals, semen, ova and embryos from approved bodies, institutes or centres\n(notified under document C(2012) 860)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/112/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down the animal health requirements governing trade in the Union in animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to the animal health requirements laid down in certain specific Union acts.

Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products in the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1163/2002(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1324/2002(5).
(3) As far as wheat and rye flour, groats and meal are concerned, when the refund on these products is being calculated, account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture. These quantities were fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

authorising the Kingdom of Spain to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 and Article 28e of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States in relation to turnover taxes — Common System of Value Added Tax; uniform basis of assessment (1), and in particular Article 27 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.
(2) In a letter dated 21 June 2005 and received in the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 22 July 2005, the Kingdom of Spain sought authorisation to introduce a measure derogating from the provisions of Directive 77/388/EEC governing the taxable amount for value added tax (VAT) purposes.
(3) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by the Kingdom of Spain in a letter dated 7 October 2005. In a letter dated 10 October 2005, the Commission notified the Kingdom of Spain that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.
(4) Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC establishes the taxable amount of a supply for VAT purposes to be everything which constitutes the consideration paid for the supply. Article 28e(1) of that Directive governs the taxable amount of intra-Community acquisitions, by reference to Article 11(A).
(5) The measure requiring a derogation is intended to counter tax losses arising from the manipulation of the taxable amount of supplies of goods, services and intra-Community acquisitions subject to VAT where a vendor charges a reduced price to a connected purchaser who does not have a right to full deduction.
(6) The measure should be targeted so that it applies only in cases of VAT avoidance or evasion and only when a number of conditions have been met. The measure is therefore proportionate to the aim pursued.
(7) Similar derogations have been granted to other Member States in order to counter tax avoidance or evasion and have been found to be effective.
(8) Derogations pursuant to Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC which counter VAT avoidance linked to the taxable amount of supplies between related parties are included in the Commission proposal of 16 March 2005 for a Directive rationalising some of the derogations pursuant to that Article (2). It is therefore necessary to bring the application period of this derogation to an end when that Directive enters into force.
(9) This derogation will safeguard the amount of VAT due at the final consumption stage and has no negative impact on the Communities' own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '3.6.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 150/11', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 15 May 2006\nauthorising the Kingdom of Spain to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 and Article 28e of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes\n(2006/387/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.\n\n((2)) In a letter dated 21 June 2005 and received in the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 22 July 2005, the Kingdom of Spain sought authorisation to introduce a measure derogating from the provisions of Directive 77/388/EEC governing the taxable amount for value added tax (VAT) purposes.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States of the request made by the Kingdom of Spain in a letter dated 7 October 2005.

Whereas:
(1) In 1994, Germany notified to the Commission a large number of applications for registration concerning mineral waters pursuant to Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 (2), 108 of which are still pending.
(2) In the case of the 31 names listed in Annex I to this Decision, the name proposed for registration is not included in the list of natural mineral waters recognized by Member States (3) in accordance with Article 1 of Directive 2009/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2009 on the exploitation and marketing of natural mineral waters (4). As a consequence, these names cannot be considered to be recognized in the internal market as marketable mineral waters and should accordingly not be registered.
(3) In the case of the 7 names listed in Annex II to this Decision, only the name and no further information has been submitted, thus preventing the Commission to perform the scrutiny required pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 in order to assess whether these names meet the conditions for registration. Therefore, these names should not be registered.
(4) In the case of the 70 names included in the Annex III to this Decision, the Commission asked the German authorities, by a letter on 20 July 2004, to provide additional information, in particular on details of control bodies, willingness of producers to cover inspection costs and structures guaranteeing the marketing of the water under a single name.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (‘the basic Regulation’) (1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
Whereas:
1.   Measures in force
(1) In October 2005, the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping measures on imports of trichloroisocyanuric acid and preparations thereof (‘TCCA’), originating in the People's Republic of China (‘PRC’) by Regulation (EC) No 1631/2005 (2) (‘the original Regulation’). The anti-dumping duty rates ranged from 7,3 % to 42,6 %.
(2) By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 855/2010 (3), the Council amended the original Regulation by lowering the anti-dumping duty rate for one exporting producer to 3,2 %.
(3) Following an expiry review, pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping measures consisting of individual duties ranging from 3,2 % to 40,5 % with a residual duty of 42,6 % on imports of TCCA originating in the PRC by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 (4).
(4) By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 569/2014 (5), the Commission imposed an individual duty rate of 32,8 % on one new exporting producer.
2.   Current investigation
(5) On 4 January 2014, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) received a request to initiate a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. The request was lodged by Juancheng Kangtai Chemical Co. Ltd (‘the applicant’), an exporting producer of TCCA in the PRC. The applicant claimed that it did not export TCCA to the European Union during the period of investigation of the original investigation and started exporting only after the end of that period. It also claimed that it was not related to any of the exporting producers of TCCA which are subject to the measures in force.
(6) The Commission considered that the prima facie evidence submitted by the applicant was sufficient to justify the initiation of a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. After the Union producers had been given an opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 727/2014 (6), a review of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 with regard to the applicant.
(7) Pursuant to Article 2 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 727/2014, the anti-dumping duty imposed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 was repealed with regard to the applicant. Simultaneously, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission directed the customs authorities to register the applicant's imports.
3.   Withdrawal of the request
(8) On 28 November 2014, the applicant formally withdrew its request for a ‘new exporter’ review. On this basis, the Commission considered that the review investigation should be terminated.
4.   Disclosure
(9) The Commission informed the interested parties of the intention to terminate the review investigation, to re-impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of TCCA and to levy this duty retroactively on imports subject to registration under Implementing Regulation (EU) No 727/2014. Interested parties were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received.
5.   Retroactive levying of the anti-dumping duty
(10) In view of the findings outlined above, the Commission concluded that the review concerning imports of TCCA manufactured by Juancheng Kangtai Chemical Co. Ltd and originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated. Consequently, the registration of the applicant's imports should cease and the country-wide duty applicable to all other companies (42,6 %) imposed by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 should be levied retroactively on these imports from the date of initiation of this review.

Whereas, since the introduction of the common organization of the sugar markets, provisions have been laid down in order to permit the sugar produced in the French overseas deparments to be marketed in the European regions of the Community; whereas Article 9 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 continues these provisions;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2067/81 (4) provides that during the marketing years 1981/82 to 1985/86 flat-rate Community aid for the marketing, in that period, in the European regions of the Community of sugar produced in the French overseas departments shall be granted, under certain conditions, to the producers and refiners of such sugar; whereas, therefore, these measures are not applicable to the quantities of such sugar which, before 1 July 1981, were sold and loaded in vessels bound for the aforesaid regions; whereas it is therefore appropriate to provide as a transitional measure that the previous system of marketing aid based on Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/74 (5) should continue to apply to sugar in respect of which the bill of lading was completed before that date;
Whereas detailed rules relating to the determination of weights and sugar yields should be laid down, particularly where products of this nature are transported in bulk in the same vessel but on behalf of several producers;

Whereas it appears necessary to specify precisely how the single flat-rate amount referred to in Article 2 (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2067/81 is to be applied;
Whereas adequate measures for the control of refined sugar, and for this purpose also a definition of refining, should be laid down;

(4) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned and 50 % by the Community budget if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States’ reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the model table that had to be provided in 2010 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than 4 or 8 years respectively. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
(5) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already and likely to be incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the Community budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently to be borne by the Community budget. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation.
(6) In clearing the accounts of the paying agencies concerned, the Commission must take account of the amounts already withheld from the Member States concerned on the basis of Decision 2010/258/EU.
(7) In accordance with Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, this Decision does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from Community financing expenditure not effected in accordance with Community rules,","{'header': '1.12.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 315/35', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 November 2010\non the clearance of the accounts of certain paying agencies in Germany concerning expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) for the 2009 financial year\n(notified under document C(2010) 8277)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(2010/730/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2010/258/EU(2)cleared, for the 2009 financial year, the accounts of all the paying agencies except for the German paying agencies ‘Baden-Württemberg’, ‘Hessen’, ‘IBH’ and ‘Helaba’, the Italian paying agencies ‘AGEA’ and ‘ARBEA’, and the Romanian paying agency ‘PIAA’.\n\n((2)) Following the transmission of new information and after additional checks, the Commission can now take a decision on the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts submitted by the German paying agencies ‘Baden-Württemberg’, ‘Hessen’, ‘IBH’ and ‘Helaba’.\n\n((3)) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD(3)lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting the monthly payments in respect of the financial year in question, i.e. 2009, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 30 July 1996 concerning State aid to Werkstoff-Union GmbH, Lippendorf (Saxony) (Only the German text is authentic) (97/124/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Article 4 (c) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 3855/91/ECSC of 27 November 1991 establishing Community rules for aid to the steel industry (1), and in particular Articles 1, 5 and 6 thereof,
Having given notice, in accordance with Article 6 (4) of that Decision, to the other Member States and the parties concerned to submit their comments,
Whereas:
I
On 17 January 1995 the Commission decided to initiate the procedure pursuant to Article 6 (4) of Decision No 3855/91/ECSC (hereinafter referred to as 'the SAC`) with respect to an investment subsidy of DM 46 million, a fiscal concession of DM 17,13 million, deficiency guarantees of 62 % of DM 178,3 million and of 62 % of DM 7 million for investments, as well as deficiency guarantees of 65 % of DM 25 million and of 65 % of DM 20 million for operating materials. Those financial measures were taken in respect of an investment of DM 285 million.
Germany was informed of that decision by letter of 2 February 1995, which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2).
Germany reacted by letter of 14 March 1995, claiming that:
- the technical and business orientation of Werkstoff-Union GmbH is the production of non-ferrous metal products made of nickel, nickel alloys and special alloys, and not to the production of ECSC products,
- it is expected that in the years 1995 to 1998 ECSC special steel will have to be produced in diminishing quantities. After five years this output will account for less than 1 % of turnover and 5 % of total quantities produced, i.e. approximately 2 000 tonnes,
- the capital goods, especially those used for smelting, are intended for the production of non-ferrous materials of the highest quality, yielding proceeds of DM 20 000 per tonne,
- a vacuum arc furnace, a vacuum multiple-chambered furnace and two installations for the resmelting of electroslag of 1,2 to 7-tonne charge feed are not suitable for the economical production of special steel,
- the plant for shaping by hydraulic forging press and rolling mill, and the machinery for tempering, descaling and polishing, match the needs of the highly specialized producers of non-ferrous metals.
Only after satisfying itself that the investment was destined for a production plant for high-quality non-ferrous metal did the Land of Saxony agree to the aids, and this is why Germany did not notify them pursuant to the SAC.
The company puts forward the following arguments to justify the need for a temporary, proportionate production of quality steels:
- the company has no experience in the production of non-ferrous metals and therefore needs an introductory phase,
- the technical installations also need a running-in period,
- the plant and its products have to be certified.
Because the company intends to produce non-ferrous goods of the highest quality for the international market, Germany is of the opinion that the aids are not subject to the SAC. The fact that in the first four years of business ECSC special steel is to be produced in small quantities does not make Werkstoff-Union GmbH into a steel company, nor does it lead to the application of the SAC.
The Commission received the following observations from third parties:
- on 27 November 1995 a letter from a steel company, stating that Werkstoff-Union GmbH is producing ECSC products and that the technical configuration allows the company to do so. Furthermore, the aid should have been notified before 30 June 1994, but was not. Lastly, the regional aids allowed pursuant to Article 5 of the SAC are permissible only for the modernization of existing companies and not for the creation of new ones,
- on 27 November 1995 a letter from another steel company, claiming that Werkstoff-Union GmbH would produce mainly ECSC products, namely stainless steel and special steels, for which the Community market is less than 300 kt/year. The capacity of Werkstoff-Union GmbH would suffice to meet 17 to 20 % of Community consumption, and this might make it the leading producer in Europe. Furthermore, it recalls that no notification was effected before 30 June 1994 and that regional investment aid could be deemed compatible only prior to 31 December 1994,
- on 9 November 1995 a letter from an association of steel producers, arguing that the aids were contrary to Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty and that Werkstoff-Union GmbH was in competition with members of the association,
- on 22 November 1995 a letter from a producer of nickel alloys, claiming that the capacity available to Werkstoff-Union GmbH was sufficient to dominate nickel-alloy bar production in Europe, and that the relatively small market (5 000 to 10 000 tonnes per year) was already experiencing a surplus of capacity,
- on 24 November 1995 a letter from another association of steel producers, contending that, on its own admission, Werkstoff-Union GmbH planned to produce and sell semi-finished products, stainless steel bars and steel alloys, in other words, ECSC products. Furthermore, it points out that Article 5, third indent, sought to facilitate the restructuring of the steel industry in the new LĂ¤nder but not to promote the construction of new plant. Aids already paid out should be reclaimed and all guarantees constitute aid,
- on 28 November 1995 a letter from the Permanent Representation of a Member State at the European Union, stating that the products of Werkstoff-Union GmbH fell within the ambit of the ECSC Treaty and that new capacity had been created with the help of aid,
- on 30 November 1995 a letter from a steel company arguing that Werkstoff-Union GmbH could obtain a 10 % market share in nickel products and that for that purpose it would need a capacity of 3 300 t/y. Since the capacity of the electric arc furnace was 48 000 t/y, the annual capacity for the production of ECSC products would stand at 44 700 t/y,
- a letter from a competitor, which was only recorded on 5 December 1995 and therefore fell outside the deadline for submissions.
Those observations were sent to the German authorities by letter of 15 January 1996, but no formal reply has been given. By letters of 9 and 29 February and 30 March 1996, Germany asked for an extension of the deadline to reply to the observations of the third parties. The reason for the request was that Werkstoff-Union GmbH's premises had been occupied by the workers. By telefax of 19 June 1996 Germany was informed that the Commission was awaiting observations within five working days and that the Commission would take a final decision even if no formal statement was received.
By letter of 16 July 1996, registered on 17 July 1996, Germany informed the Commission of the application by Werkstoff-Union GmbH on 5 March 1996 for the opening of bankruptcy proceedings (Gesamtvollstreckung) and of the order of the Court of Leipzig of the same day to effect sequestration. The Commission was also informed that Werkstoff-Union GmbH had ceased production on 5 March 1996.
For the information of the Commission, Germany attached to its telefax of 16 July 1996 a position paper from Werkstoff-Union GmbH, which contained, inter alia, the information that the bankruptcy proceedings had commenced on 1 May 1996.
Germany was either unable or unwilling to submit the paper as its own official comment to the Commission. It merely transmitted to the Commission the company's letter for information purposes, without adopting as its own, expressly or implicitly, the views expressed therein. Consequently, for the purposes of these proceedings, the document cannot be regarded as representing the position taken by Germany.
The decision to open the procedure is addressed to the Member State in question. The beneficiary of the aid - Werkstoff-Union GmbH in this case - is an interested third party, entitled to submit its observations within one month of the date of publication of the decision in the Official Journal of the European Communities. As was stated above, the decision was published on 27 November 1995. The position paper from Werkstoff-Union GmbH reached the Commission only on 17 July 1996, which is clearly too late. Accordingly, the position paper from Werkstoff-Union GmbH, transmitted to the Commission, has to be disregarded.
II
The investments made by Werkstoff-Union GmbH serve to create capacity to produce products that fall under the ECSC Treaty. This capacity includes the smelting of steel, the continuous casting of semi-finished products and the rolling of bars.
Apart from the fact that Werkstoff-Union GmbH has acquired ECSC production capacity as a result of State-induced investments, Germany's letter of 14 March 1995 reveals that it was expected that Werkstoff-Union GmbH would produce ECSC special steel between 1995 and 1998, albeit at a modest level. The Commission does not agree with Germany about the scale of that production. By letter of 14 December 1994 Germany informed the Commission of the projections of the company as to production from 1995 to 1999. In 1995 it expected to produce 12 000 t, in 1996 20 000 t, in 1997 19 000 t, in 1998 14 000 t, and in 1999 2 000 t of special steel. The proportion of non-ECSC special steel in these figures could not be accurately estimated. On the basis of the figures and the mere possibility that non-ECSC special steel might be produced, the Commission regards the expected production levels of ECSC steel as significant.
In its customer brochure Werkstoff-Union GmbH lists in its range of products, continuous cast billets, ingots, slabs, rolled long products in sizes from 40 to 140 mm and sheet bars, that is to say, products listed in Annex I to the ECSC Treaty.
Werkstoff-Union GmbH declares its production of ECSC products to the Commission on a quarterly basis and pays levies pursuant to Article 49 of the ECSC Treaty.
As a consequence of the above it must be concluded that Werkstoff-Union GmbH is an ECSC undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of the ECSC Treaty and that the aid granted by Germany is caught by the general prohibition of aid laid down in Article 4 (c) thereof.
On the basis of the SAC certain aid measures may be deemed compatible with the common market for steel. Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the SAC cannot be considered, since the aid is not intended to finance R& D, environmental protection or closures.
Article 5 of the SAC provides that aid granted to steel undertakings for investment under general regional aid schemes may until 31 December 1994 be deemed compatible with the common market, provided that the aided undertaking is located in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic, and that the aid is accompanied by a reduction in the overall production capacity of that territory.
Article 5 of the SAC has to be read in conjunction with Section II of its preamble. In the fourth paragraph of Section II it is declared that regional investment aids are exceptional in nature and that there would be no justification in maintaining them beyond the appropriate period for the modernization of steel plants, which is set at three years. The application of Article 5 was limited in time because the aim it should facilitate, namely the modernization of existing steel plants, would not take more than a certain period of time. It is therefore clear that aid for investment within the meaning of Article 5 must mean aid for modernizing existing steel plants and not for the creation of new ECSC production capacity.
Furthermore, after 31 December 1994, Articles 1 (1) and 5 of the SAC allow no further possibility for declaring regional investment aid for steel undertakings in Germany compatible with the common market for steel, regardless of whether the aid would have been authorizable had it been notified in time.
The aid for investment has been given in the form of an investment subsidy of DM 46 million, a fiscal concession of DM 17,13 million, one deficiency guarantee amounting to 62 % of a sum of DM 178,3 million and another deficiency guarantee amounting to 62 % of DM 7 million. The investment subsidy and the tax concession both constitute State aid as they involve a distribution of State resources to the recipient and an undertaking by the State not to collect taxes up to the amount of the concession. The deficiency guarantees contains State aid. In its letter SG(89) D/4328 of 5 April 1989 the Commission informed the Member States that it regarded all guarantees given by the State direct or granted on the State's delegation via financial institutions as falling within the scope of Article 92 (1) of the EC Treaty. There is no valid reason to take a different attitude when applying the ECSC Treaty and law derived from it. Germany has not produced any evidence to show that those guarantees do not actually include State aid or that they would qualify for exemption under the SAC.
Since the investment was aimed at the creation of new capacity and not at modernizing an existing plant, those aids are not protected by Article 5 of the SAC from the application of Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty. Furthermore, even if Article 5 of the SAC did sanction the aids, the Commission cannot declare the aids to be compatible with the common market because Articles 1 and 5 of the SAC do not admit of such compatibility after 31 December 1994.
Consequently the investment aids are caught by the prohibition of Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty.
The deficiency guarantees amounting to 65 % of DM 25 million and 65 % of DM 20 million for operating equipment (Betriebsmittel) contain State aid. No argument has been presented by Germany that could point to any other conclusion. This aid is caught by the prohibition of Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty since the SAC does not allow aid for operating purposes.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009, the Commission is to verify that the holder of the recognition granted in accordance with Article 2(c) and Article 4(3) of that Regulation is the relevant legal entity within the organisation to which the provisions of that Regulation apply. If that is not the case, the Commission is to take a decision amending that recognition.
(2) The recognitions of the two organisations Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd (‘the Parties’) were granted in 1995 under Council Directive 94/57/EC (2).
(3) Pursuant to Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009, the Parties retained their respective recognitions at the entry into force of that Regulation.
(4) The initial recognition of Det Norske Veritas was granted to the legal entity DNV Classification AS, later on renamed DNV AS, which operated under the non-operational entity DNV Group AS, financially controlled by the non-profit foundation Stiftelsen Det Norske Veritas (‘SDNV’), established in Norway.
(5) The initial recognition of Germanischer Lloyd was granted to the legal entity Germanischer Lloyd AG, later on established as Germanischer Lloyd SE (‘GL SE’), which operated under the non-operational entity GL Group, financially controlled by the holding Mayfair, established in Germany.
(6) On 10 June 2013, the Commission received a notification of a proposed concentration pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 (3) by which SDNV acquires, within the meaning of Article 3(1)(b) of that Regulation, sole control of GL SE and combines it with its subsidiary DNV Group AS, thereafter to be renamed DNV GL Group AS.
(7) On 15 July 2013, the Commission adopted a decision pursuant to Article 6(1)(b) of the Merger Regulation to not oppose the concentration, referred to as ‘Case COMP/M.6885 — SDNV/Germanischer Lloyd’, and to declare it compatible with the internal market.
(8) The non-operational entity DNV GL Group AS, established in Norway, became effective on 12 September 2013. The Parties informed the Commission that, until the start of joint operations, the legacy organisations DNV AS and GL SE continued to exist and to operate independently under the umbrella of DNV GL Group AS in accordance with their respective legacy rules, procedures and systems.
(9) The ownership of GL SE was transferred to DNV AS, thereafter renamed DNV GL AS. From this moment, which marks the commencement of joint operations, DNV GL AS, with its subsidiaries, is responsible for all classification and certification activities falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009. DNV GL AS is therefore the relevant parent entity of all legal entities that constitute the recognised organisation, and to which the recognition should be granted.
(10) Conversely, GL SE is no longer the relevant parent entity of the organisation, to which the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009 should apply. Therefore, its recognition pursuant to Article 4 of that Regulation should cease.
(11) The information supplied to the Commission by the Parties indicates that, from the start of joint operations and until a common production system is in place, existing ships and ongoing projects should be handled separately, according to the legacy rules, procedures and systems of DNV AS and GL SE respectively. Functions and systems should be gradually integrated to ensure continuous compliance with the obligations and criteria of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3) and 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 26 August 2005, Pioneer Overseas Corporation submitted to the competent authority of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 59122xNK603 maize (the application).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of 59122xNK603 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. It also includes a monitoring plan for environmental effects conforming with Annex VII to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 25 November 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from 59122xNK603 maize as described in the application (the products) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses (3). In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(4) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(5) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(6) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(7) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 59122xNK603 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(8) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(9) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(10) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of, or containing GMOs.
(11) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Articles 9(1) and 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (6).
(12) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(13) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman.
(14) At its meeting on 19 October 2009, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. The Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,","{'header': '5.11.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 289/29', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 October 2009\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize 59122xNK603 (DAS-59122-7xMON-ØØ6Ø3-6) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2009) 8386)\n(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/815/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 26 August 2005, Pioneer Overseas Corporation submitted to the competent authority of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 59122xNK603 maize (the application).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of 59122xNK603 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/95/EC requires the Commission to evaluate certain hazardous substances prohibited pursuant to Article 4(1) of that Directive.
(2) Certain materials and components containing hexavalent chromium should be exempted from the prohibition, since the use of this hazardous substance in those specific materials and components is still unavoidable, or because the negative environmental, health or consumer safety impacts caused by substitution are likely to outweigh the environmental, health or consumer safety benefits thereof. The exemption is granted on the basis of the results of a review process carried out by technical experts taking into account available evidence from studies, stakeholders and other scientific/technical sources. This review concluded that the elimination or substitution of the substance is still technically or scientifically impracticable until 1 July 2007. A similar exemption is provided in Directive 2000/53/EC on End of Life Vehicles.
(3) Some exemptions from the prohibition for certain specific materials or components should be limited in their scope, in order to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, given that the use of those substances in such applications will become avoidable.
(4) Pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of Directive 2002/95/EC each exemption listed in the Annex must be subject to a review at least every four years or four years after an item is added to the list.
(5) Directive 2002/95/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Articles 58 and 131 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that substances meeting the criteria for classification as carcinogenic (category 1 or 2), mutagenic (category 1 or 2) and toxic for reproduction (category 1 or 2) in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (2), substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, substances that are very persistent and very bioaccumulative, and/or substances for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health and environment giving rise to an equivalent level of concern may be subject to authorisation.
(2) Pursuant to Article 58(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (3), as from 1 December 2010 Article 57(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 shall refer to the classification criteria laid down respectively in Sections 3.6, 3.5 and 3.7 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Therefore, references in this Regulation to the classification criteria referred to in Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should be made in accordance with that provision.
(3) 5-tert-butyl-2,4,6-trinitro-m-xylene (musk xylene) is very persistent and very bioaccumulative in accordance with the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(e) and set out in Annex XIII to that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(4) 4,4’-Diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA) meets the criteria for classification as carcinogenic (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(a) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(5) Alkanes, C10-13, chloro (Short Chain Chlorinated Paraffins – SCCPs) are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, and very persistent and very bioaccumulative in accordance with the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(d) and (e) respectively and set out in Annex XIII to that Regulation. They have been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(6) Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and the diastereoisomers alpha-, beta- and gamma-hexabromocyclododecane are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic in accordance with the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(d) and set out in Annex XIII to that Regulation. They have been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(7) Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(8) Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(9) Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.
(10) The abovementioned substances have been prioritised for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 by the European Chemicals Agency in its recommendation of 1 June 2009 (4) in accordance with Article 58 of that Regulation.
(11) In December 2009, SCCPs were included as a persistent organic pollutant under the 1998 Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The inclusion of SCCPs in this Protocol has triggered additional obligations for the European Union under Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC (5) that could have an impact on the inclusion at this stage of SCCPs in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
(12) For each substance listed in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, where the applicant wishes to continue to use the substance or place the substance on the market, it is appropriate to set a date by which applications must be received by the European Chemicals Agency, in accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(ii) of that Regulation.
(13) For each substance listed in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 it is appropriate to set a date from which the use and placing on the market is prohibited, in accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(i) of that Regulation.
(14) The European Chemicals Agency recommendation of 1 June 2009 has identified different latest application dates for the substances listed in the Annex to this Regulation. These dates should be set on the basis of the estimated time that would be required to prepare an application for the authorisation, taking into account the information available on the different substances and specifically the information received during the public consultation carried out in accordance with Article 58(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Factors such as the number of actors in the supply chain, their homogeneity or heterogeneity, the existence of ongoing substitution efforts and information on potential alternatives and the expected complexity of the preparation of the analysis of alternatives should be taken into account.
(15) In accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the latest application date is to be set at least 18 months before the sunset date.
(16) Article 58(1)(e) in conjunction with Article 58(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides for the possibility of exemptions of uses or categories of uses in cases where there is specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements relating to the protection of human health or the environment that ensures proper control of the risks.
(17) DEHP, BBP, and DBP are used in the immediate packaging of medicinal products. Aspects of safety of the immediate packaging of medicines are covered by Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (6) and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (7). That legislation of the Union provides for a framework to properly control risks of such immediate packaging materials by imposing requirements on the quality, stability, and safety of the immediate packaging materials. It is therefore appropriate to exempt the use of DEHP, BBP, and DBP in the immediate packaging of medicinal products from authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
(18) In accordance with Article 60(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the Commission should not consider, when granting authorisations, the human health risks associated with the use of substances in medical devices regulated by Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices (8), Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices (9), or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (10). In addition, Article 62(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that applications for authorisation should not include the risks to human health arising from the use of a substance in a medical device regulated under those Directives. It follows that an application for an authorisation should not be required for a substance used in medical devices regulated under Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC, or 98/79/EC if such a substance has been identified in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 for human health concerns only. Therefore, an assessment as to whether the conditions for an exemption pursuant to Article 58(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 apply is not necessary.
(19) On the basis of the information currently available it is not appropriate to set exemptions for product and process orientated research and development.
(20) On the basis of the information currently available it is not appropriate to set review periods for certain uses.
(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,","{'header': '18.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 44/2', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 143/2011\nof 17 February 2011\namending Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (‘REACH’)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that substances meeting the criteria for classification as carcinogenic (category 1 or 2), mutagenic (category 1 or 2) and toxic for reproduction (category 1 or 2) in accordance with Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances(2), substances that are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic, substances that are very persistent and very bioaccumulative, and/or substances for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health and environment giving rise to an equivalent level of concern may be subject to authorisation.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 58(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006(3), as from 1 December 2010 Article 57(a), (b) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 shall refer to the classification criteria laid down respectively in Sections 3.6, 3.5 and 3.7 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.

They have been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.\n\n((7)) Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.\n\n((8)) Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.\n\n((9)) Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) meets the criteria for classification as toxic for reproduction (category 1B) in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 and therefore meets the criteria for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 pursuant to Article 57(c) of that Regulation. It has been identified and included in the candidate list in accordance with Article 59 of that Regulation.\n\n((10)) The abovementioned substances have been prioritised for inclusion in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 by the European Chemicals Agency in its recommendation of 1 June 2009(4)in accordance with Article 58 of that Regulation.\n\n((11)) In December 2009, SCCPs were included as a persistent organic pollutant under the 1998 Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The inclusion of SCCPs in this Protocol has triggered additional obligations for the European Union under Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC(5)that could have an impact on the inclusion at this stage of SCCPs in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n\n((12)) For each substance listed in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, where the applicant wishes to continue to use the substance or place the substance on the market, it is appropriate to set a date by which applications must be received by the European Chemicals Agency, in accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(ii) of that Regulation.\n\n((13)) For each substance listed in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 it is appropriate to set a date from which the use and placing on the market is prohibited, in accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(i) of that Regulation.\n\n((14)) The European Chemicals Agency recommendation of 1 June 2009 has identified different latest application dates for the substances listed in the Annex to this Regulation. These dates should be set on the basis of the estimated time that would be required to prepare an application for the authorisation, taking into account the information available on the different substances and specifically the information received during the public consultation carried out in accordance with Article 58(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Factors such as the number of actors in the supply chain, their homogeneity or heterogeneity, the existence of ongoing substitution efforts and information on potential alternatives and the expected complexity of the preparation of the analysis of alternatives should be taken into account.\n\n((15)) In accordance with Article 58(1)(c)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the latest application date is to be set at least 18 months before the sunset date.\n\n((16)) Article 58(1)(e) in conjunction with Article 58(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides for the possibility of exemptions of uses or categories of uses in cases where there is specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements relating to the protection of human health or the environment that ensures proper control of the risks.\n\n((17)) DEHP, BBP, and DBP are used in the immediate packaging of medicinal products. Aspects of safety of the immediate packaging of medicines are covered by Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products(6)and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use(7). That legislation of the Union provides for a framework to properly control risks of such immediate packaging materials by imposing requirements on the quality, stability, and safety of the immediate packaging materials. It is therefore appropriate to exempt the use of DEHP, BBP, and DBP in the immediate packaging of medicinal products from authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n\n((18)) In accordance with Article 60(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the Commission should not consider, when granting authorisations, the human health risks associated with the use of substances in medical devices regulated by Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices(8), Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices(9), or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 onin vitrodiagnostic medical devices(10). In addition, Article 62(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 provides that applications for authorisation should not include the risks to human health arising from the use of a substance in a medical device regulated under those Directives. It follows that an application for an authorisation should not be required for a substance used in medical devices regulated under Directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC, or 98/79/EC if such a substance has been identified in Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 for human health concerns only. Therefore, an assessment as to whether the conditions for an exemption pursuant to Article 58(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 apply is not necessary.\n\n((19)) On the basis of the information currently available it is not appropriate to set exemptions for product and process orientated research and development.\n\n((20)) On the basis of the information currently available it is not appropriate to set review periods for certain uses.\n\n((21)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nIn Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 the following table is inserted:\n‘Entry Nr\nSubstance\nIntrinsic property(ies) referred to in Article 57\nTransitional arrangements\nExempted (categories of) uses\nReview periods\nLatest application date\n(\n1\n)\nSunset date\n(\n2\n)\n1.\n5-tert-butyl-2,4,6-trinitro-m-xylene\n(\nMusk xylene\n)\nEC No: 201-329-4\nCAS No: 81-15-2\nvPvB\n21 January 2013\n21 July 2014\n—\n—\n2.\n4,4’-Diaminodiphenylmethane\n(MDA)\nEC No: 202-974-4\nCAS No: 101-77-9\nCarcinogenic\n(category 1B)\n21 January 2013\n21 July 2014\n—\n—\n3.\nHexabromocyclododecane\n(\nHBCDD\n)\nEC No: 221-695-9,\n247-148-4,\nCAS No: 3194-55-6\n25637-99-4\nalpha-hexabromocyclododecane\nCAS No\n:\n134237-50-6,\nbeta-hexabromocyclododecane\nCAS No\n:\n134237-51-7\ngamma-hexabromocyclododecane\nCAS No\n:\n134237-52-8\nPBT\n21 January 2014\n21 July 2015\n—\n—\n4.\nBis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate\n(\nDEHP\n)\nEC No: 204-211-0\nCAS No: 117-81-7\nToxic for reproduction\n(category 1B)\n21 July 2013\n21 January 2015\nUses in the immediate packaging of medicinal products covered under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Directive 2001/82/EC, and/or Directive 2001/83/EC.\n5.\nBenzyl butyl phthalate\n(\nBBP\n)\nEC No: 201-622-7\nCAS No: 85-68-7\nToxic for reproduction\n(category 1B)\n21 July 2013\n21 January 2015\nUses in the immediate packaging of medicinal products covered under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Directive 2001/82/EC, and/or Directive 2001/83/EC.\n6.\nDibutyl phthalate\n(\nDBP\n)\nEC No: 201-557-4\nCAS No: 84-74-2\nToxic for reproduction\n(category 1B)\n21 July 2013\n21 January 2015\nUses in the immediate packaging of medicinal products covered under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, Directive 2001/82/EC, and/or Directive 2001/83/EC.\n(\n1\n)\nDate referred to in Article 58(1)(c)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.\n(\n2\n)\nDate referred to in Article 58(1)(c)(i) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.’'}]}"

Whereas Article 12 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 provides that the Community withdrawal and selling prices for each of the products listed in Annex I (A) and (E) are to be fixed by applying the conversion factor for the product category concerned to an amount equal to at least 70 % but not more than 90 % of the relevant guide price;
Whereas the guide prices for the fishing year from 1 March to 31 December 1986 were fixed for the products included by the Act of Accession in the price system provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 and were adjusted for Atlantic sardines and anchovies by Council Regulation (EEC) No 503/86 (2); whereas it is therefore necessary to adjust the withdrawal prices for Atlantic sardines and anchovies in the light of the adjusted guide prices from which they are derived;
Whereas, with regard to sardines, special conditions have been adopted in the Act of Accession in order to ensure a progressive alignment of prices of sardines from the Atlantic on price levels of sardines from the Mediterranean; whereas the production structure and access to the market of Atlantic sardines are different to that for Mediterranean sardines and meet the special needs of the processing industry; whereas, with a view to the smooth application of the alignment of prices which does not artificially disturb market supply conditions, it is necessary to fix a special adaptation coefficient for size 3 of this product in the landing areas concerned in Spain and Portugal;
Whereas, with regard to monkfish, Norway lobster and crab, the statistical data available during the accession negotiations did not permit a clear appreciation of the differences between the prices ruling on the markets in the different regions of the Community; whereas it appears that the substantial price differences established since then for these species are basically explained by the absence, until now, of a Community price system favouring their unity within the Community; whereas, in these particular circumstances, it is necessary to fix adjustment coefficients for these species which allow for the smooth application of the price system set out within the Act of Accession, by a progressive alignment of them under favourable conditions which guarantee market access to the producers in these regions;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) and Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC (2), and in particular Article 3(1) and Article 7(e) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (3) lays down the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals or fresh meat. It also lays down the lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which those consignments may be introduced into the Union.
(2) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 provides that consignments of ungulates are to be introduced into the Union only if they come from the third countries, territories or parts thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex I thereto for which there is a model veterinary certificate corresponding to the consignment concerned listed in that Part. In addition, those consignments are to be accompanied by the appropriate veterinary certificate, drawn up in accordance with the relevant model set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, taking into account the specific conditions indicated in column 6 of the table in Part 1 of that Annex.
(3) The whole territory of Canada, except the Okanagan Valley region of British Columbia, is currently listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as approved for the export to the Union, inter alia, of domestic ovine animals (Ovis aries) and domestic caprine animals (Capra hircus) intended for breeding and/or production after importation and accompanied by a veterinary certificate in accordance with model OVI-X. However, Canada is not listed in column 6 of the table in Part 1 of that Annex as having an official brucellosis-free status for the purposes of exports to the Union of live animals certified according to that model certificate.
(4) Council Directive 91/68/EEC of 28 January 1991 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals (4) lays down, inter alia, the conditions under which Member States or regions thereof may be recognised as being officially brucellosis-free.
(5) In addition, Directive 2004/68/EC provides that, where the equivalence of the official health guarantees provided for by a third country can be formally recognised by the Union, the specific animal health conditions for the introduction of live ungulates from that third country into the Union may be based on those guarantees.
(6) Canada has submitted to the Commission documentation demonstrating compliance with the conditions laid down in Directive 91/68/EEC to be recognised as officially free from brucellosis (B. melitensis) for the entire territory of that third country for the purposes of exports to the Union of domestic ovine animals (Ovis aries) and domestic caprine animals (Capra hircus) intended for breeding and/or production after importation and accompanied by a veterinary certificate in accordance with model certificate OVI-X set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010.
(7) Following the evaluation of the documentation submitted by Canada, that third country should be recognised as being officially free from brucellosis (B. melitensis). The appropriate reference should therefore be included in the entry for that third country in column 6 of the table in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010.
(8) In addition, Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 provides that consignments of fresh meat intended for human consumption are to be imported into the Union only if they come from the third countries, territories or parts thereof listed in Part 1 of Annex II to that Regulation for which there is a model veterinary certificate corresponding to the consignment concerned listed in that Part.
(9) Four parts of the territory of Botswana are listed in Part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as regions from which imports of fresh de-boned and matured meat from ungulates into the Union are authorised. Those regions consist of a number of veterinary disease control zones.
(10) Following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in region BW-1 of Botswana, Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 801/2011 (5), provides that the authorisation of Botswana to export fresh de-boned and matured meat from ungulates into the Union from that region is suspended as from 11 May 2011. The region BW-1 of Botswana is composed of veterinary disease control zones 3c, 4b, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 18.
(11) On 2 December 2011, Botswana notified the Commission of the successful approval of veterinary disease control zones 3c, 4b, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 18 as free from foot-and-mouth disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health. The suspension of the authorisation to export fresh de-boned and matured meat from ungulates into the Union from that region is therefore no longer necessary.
(12) However, within veterinary disease control zone 6, Botswana has declared an area close to the border with Zimbabwe as a intensive surveillance zone and informed the Commission that all domestic bovine animals in that zone were slaughtered. That area should not be authorised for exports to the Union of fresh de-boned and matured meat from ungulates. It should therefore be excluded from the region BW-1 as listed in part 1 of Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010.
(13) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(1) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation.

(5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally, the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties.

Whereas Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 (2) affords sugar-producing undertakings the possibility of carrying forward sugar produced in a given marketing year to be treated as part of the following year's production; whereas that Article lays down for the sugar carried forward an obligatory storage period of 12 months beginning on 1 February of the marketing year in which the sugar was produced with, as a counterpart, the reimbursement of storage costs during that period; whereas only undertakings situated in the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique have a specific storage period corresponding to their sugar production period;
Whereas these mandatory dates fixed for the start of the storage period no longer correspond to the requirements of sugar production as it has evolved in the various regions of the Community; whereas, in order to avoid inequalities in treatment between producers in these regions, according to whether they begin their production earlier or later, and thus to allow the earlier producers to make use of the aforesaid possibility as soon as their production exceeds their A quotas, the dates on which the obligatory storage period starts should henceforth no longer be laid down in the said Article 27 but, without affecting the principles involved, in the relevant detailed rules of application;
Whereas, having regard to production in the 1981/82 marketing year and to the need felt by undertakings to carry sugar forward, it is now appropriate for the carry-forward to the 1982/83 marketing year to provide measures which will retroactively allow all Community sugar-producing undertakings to make arrangements in this respect,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 192/82 of 26 January 1982 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '27', 'title': 'Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 is hereby amended as follows:', 'text': ""Article 27 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. the first and second subparagraphs of paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n'2.

of 19 June 2001
opening crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for table wines in France
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Articles 30 and 33 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the possibility of opening crisis distillation in the event of exceptional market disturbance caused by major surpluses. Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production and may apply to quality wines psr at the request of the Member State.
(2) The French Government has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wines produced in France.
(3) Production of table wine in France was 22,6 million hectolitres in 1997 and 21,1 million hectolitres in 1998. In 1999 the figure was 25,2 million hectolitres and in 2000 it was 23,02 million hectolitres.
(4) Over that same period, table wine consumption in France remained relatively stable in the 1996/97 and 1997/98 wine years at around 18,3 million hectolitres, but fell in 1998/99 to 17,3 million hectolitres, which also appears to be the level of consumption for 1999/2000. By contrast, exports rose slightly between 1997 and 1999, but only exports to other Member States. Provisional figures for 2000 point to a fall in exports.
(5) Stocks of table wine were 12,853 million hectolitres in 1997 and 12,086 million hectolitres in 1998. They fell to 10,85 million hectolitres in 1999. In 2000, they rose sharply to 14,07 million hectolitres. The fluctuation in stocks obviously varies widely from one department to the next, but it is very pronounced in departments with a large stock, with increases of between 47 % and 88 %. The growth in stocks has had a negative impact on prices, which have fallen by about 10 % to 17 % over the current wine year compared with the same period in the previous year.
(6) In view of this situation, crisis distillation was opened for 800000 hectolitres of wine by Commission Regulation (EC) No 25/2001 of 5 January 2001 opening crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for table wines in France(3). It has been found that this volume is insufficient to reduce stocks of table wine to an acceptable level and rectify the difficult market situation.
(7) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are still satisfied, a further crisis distillation covering a maximum of 1,5 million hectolitres of table wine should be opened. The measure should apply for a limited period with a view to maximum effectiveness. No ceiling shoud be set on the quantity that individual producers can have distilled because stocks may vary substantially from one producer to another and depend more on sales than on the individual producer's annual output.
(8) The mechanism to be introduced is that provided for by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2001(5). In addition to the Articles of that Regulation referring to the distillation measures provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of an advance.
(9) The price to be paid by distillers to producers should be set at a level that permits the solution of the problems faced by allowing producers to take advantage of this measure. That price should not, however, be such that it adversely affects the application of the distillation measure provided for by Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
(10) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by distillation under Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1203/2001 of 19 June 2001 opening crisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 for table wines in France', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nCrisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 is opened for a maximum of 1,5 million hectolitres of table wine in France.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nIn addition to the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 referring to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the following provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 shall also apply to the measure provided for in this Regulation:\n\n- Article 62(5) with respect to the payment by the intervention agency of the price referred to in Article 6(2) of this Regulation,\n\n- Articles 66 and 67 with respect to the advance referred to in Article 6(2) of this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nProducers may conclude contracts as provided for in Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 from 21 June 2001 to 26 June 2001.

Whereas for an additive belonging to the group 'Antibiotics`, the details in the column 'Chemical formula, description` should be supplemented;
Whereas a new use of an additive belonging to the group 'Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances` and a new use of one belonging to the group 'Binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants` have been widely tested in certain Member States; whereas in the light of the experience gained and research carried out these new uses may be authorized throughout the Community;
Whereas the provisions of the Annexes on one additive of the group 'Emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents` require adjustment to the Community provisions adopted on this matter as regards foodstuffs;
Whereas for two additives of the group 'Emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents` and for one of the group 'Preservatives` the entry in the 'Other provisions` column should be altered;
Whereas a new use of an additive of the group 'Antibiotics` and of one of the group 'Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances` have been successfully tested in certain Member States; whereas provisional national authorization of these new uses should be permitted pending possible general Community authorization;
Whereas the minimum authorized content of an additive of the 'Micro-organisms` group should be altered;
Whereas research into various additives in Annex II, use of which can accordingly be authorized nationally, has not yet been completed; whereas for each of these this option should therefore be extended by a set period;
Whereas Directive 97/6/EC prohibited use of the glycopeptide antibiotic avoparcin with effect from 1 April 1997 on the grounds that it could not be ruled out that its use in animal feed was liable to induce resistance to glycopeptides used in human medicine;
Whereas another glycopeptide, ardacin, was given provisional authorization by Commission Directive 94/77/EC of 20 December 1994 amending Council Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (4); whereas although this additive is not at present marketed, as a precautionary measure and in line with the Scientific Committee's recommendations, in the absence of results from the research still to be carried out on avoparcin, its authorization should not be prolonged;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Feedingstuffs,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 97/72/EC of 15 December 1997 amending Council Directive 70/524/EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annexes to Directive 70/524/EEC are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1256/2002 of 11 July 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 12 July 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 July 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Whereas:
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in New Caledonia to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The requirements in the legislation of New Caledonia on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular, the ""Direction des Affaires Vétérinaires, Alimentaires et Rurales (DAVAR) of the Département de l'Économie Rurale"" is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from New Caledonia. In particular those rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with article 3(1) (a) (I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3).

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 of 7 October 2010 on administrative cooperation and combating fraud in the field of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 44(1), second subparagraph of Article 44(2), Article 45(1) and (2), and Article 51(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 lays down the rules for the administrative cooperation and the fight against fraud in the field of value added tax (VAT). Articles 44 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 specifically concern the exchange of information relating to the special schemes for telecommunications, broadcasting or electronic services provided for in Chapter 6 of Title XII of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (2). Those special schemes involve a taxable person established outside the Member State of consumption declaring the VAT due on relevant sales in the Member State of consumption via an electronic interface in the Member State of identification (one-stop shop).
(2) Certain information relating to transactions carried out under those special schemes is to be collected and exchanged between Member States. Specifically, that relates to the exchange of identification and the collection and exchange of VAT return details, including corrections to those VAT returns, between Member States.
(3) To ensure that information is exchanged in a uniform manner, it is necessary to adopt the technical details for such exchange, including a common electronic message. This would also allow for the uniform development of the technical and functional specifications, as they would follow a regulated framework.
(4) Certain information relating to changes to the identification details such as the exclusion from the special schemes, the voluntary cessation or the change of Member State of identification should also be exchanged, without delay, in a uniform manner in order to allow Member States to monitor the correct application of the special schemes and to combat fraud. To that end, common arrangements for the electronic exchange of such information should be provided.
(5) In order to keep the administrative burden to a minimum, it is necessary to establish certain requirements for the electronic interface that facilitate submission of identification information and VAT returns by taxable persons. Member States should not be prevented from providing additional functionalities to further reduce administrative burdens.
(6) In order to ensure that the information relating to registration into the scheme, and VAT returns rendered under the scheme, can be transmitted and processed effectively Member States should develop their electronic interface in a uniform manner. It is therefore necessary to establish the common electronic message for the transmission of that information.
(7) It is necessary to clarify the information to be submitted in cases where no sales under the special schemes are made in a particular period in one or all Member States.
(8) With a view to enabling Member States and taxable persons to refer to the VAT returns in an unequivocal way in their subsequent communications, including on the payment of the tax, the Member State of identification should allocate a unique reference number to each VAT return.
(9) This Regulation should apply from the same day from which Articles 44 and 45 of Regulation (EU) No 904/2010 apply.

Whereas Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (6) defined the conditions which must be satisfied as regards classical swine fever by live pigs intended for intra-Community trade;
Whereas Council Directive 72/461/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (7) defines the conditions which must be satisfied as regards classical swine fever by fresh pigmeat intended for intra-Community trade;
Whereas, as a result of national programmes to eradicate classical swine fever introduced in the framework of a Community measure, some Member States have totally eradicated the disease and can claim to be officially free of classical swine fever; whereas they should therefore be given the possibility of maintaining the status they have acquired and preventing the reappearance of the disease on their territory by strengthening the safeguards which they enjoy as regards trade in the products concerned, in view of the adverse effects of this disease on the productivity of pig herds and on the income of those working in this sector,","{'title': 'Council Directive 87/489/EEC of 22 September 1987 amending Directives 64/432/EEC and 72/461/EEC as regards certain measures relating to swine fever', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDirective 64/432/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 introduces new agrimonetary arrangements with effect from 1 January 1993; whereas, as part of these arrangements, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93 of 30 April 1993 on detailed rules for determining and applying  the agricultural conversion rates (2), lays down the operative events for the agricultural conversion rates to be applied after the transitional measures provided for in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 (3), without prejudice to  detailed rules or derogations to be provided for where necessary in the rules relating to the sectors concerned on the basis of the criteria indicated in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92;
Whereas, in accordance with the second subparagraph, second indent, of Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1068/93, the provisions of that Regulation are to apply in the raw tobacco sector from 1 July 1993, subject to the derogations provided for in this  Regulation which brings together, for reasons of clarity, the specific provisions applicable in the tobacco sector;
Whereas the premiums provided for in Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco (4), form a large part of the income of tobacco producers; whereas payment of the premium is  not linked to compliance with a particular purchase price; whereas the amount of the premium must be paid to the producers by the first processors; whereas, therefore, dates should be set for the operative event which take into account the rate of  deliveries subsequent to harvest, while simplifying first processors' administration; whereas the same operative event must apply to advances on the premium payment;
Whereas the specific aid referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 is a supplementary payment added to the premium which gives rise to a single payment after controls; whereas, therefore, the agricultural conversion rate must be the most  recent conversion rate applicable to the premium;
Whereas the conversion aid provided for in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3616/92 of 15 December 1992 adopting conversion measures for tobacco of the varieties Mavra, Tsebelia, Forchheimer Havanna II c and hybrids of Geudertheimer (5),  gives rise to a single annual payment; whereas, therefore, a date sufficiently close to the start of the harvest concerned by conversion should be set for determination of the operative event;

","Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 19 July 2002
on the application of international accounting standards
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 emphasised the need to accelerate completion of the internal market for financial services, set the deadline of 2005 to implement the Commission's Financial Services Action Plan and urged that steps be taken to enhance the comparability of financial statements prepared by publicly traded companies.
(2) In order to contribute to a better functioning of the internal market, publicly traded companies must be required to apply a single set of high quality international accounting standards for the preparation of their consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, it is important that the financial reporting standards applied by Community companies participating in financial markets are accepted internationally and are truly global standards. This implies an increasing convergence of accounting standards currently used internationally with the ultimate objective of achieving a single set of global accounting standards.
(3) Council Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 on the annual accounts of certain types of companies(4), Council Directive 83/349/EEC of 13 June 1983 on consolidated accounts(5), Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions(6) and Council Directive 91/674/EEC of 19 December 1991 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of insurance companies(7) are also addressed to publicly traded Community companies. The reporting requirements set out in these Directives cannot ensure the high level of transparency and comparability of financial reporting from all publicly traded Community companies which is a necessary condition for building an integrated capital market which operates effectively, smoothly and efficiently. It is therefore necessary to supplement the legal framework applicable to publicly traded companies.
(4) This Regulation aims at contributing to the efficient and cost-effective functioning of the capital market. The protection of investors and the maintenance of confidence in the financial markets is also an important aspect of the completion of the internal market in this area. This Regulation reinforces the freedom of movement of capital in the internal market and helps to enable Community companies to compete on an equal footing for financial resources available in the Community capital markets, as well as in world capital markets.
(5) It is important for the competitiveness of Community capital markets to achieve convergence of the standards used in Europe for preparing financial statements, with international accounting standards that can be used globally, for cross-border transactions or listing anywhere in the world.
(6) On 13 June 2000, the Commission published its Communication on ""EU Financial Reporting Strategy: the way forward"" in which it was proposed that all publicly traded Community companies prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with one single set of accounting standards, namely International Accounting Standards (IAS), at the latest by 2005.
(7) International Accounting Standards (IASs) are developed by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), whose purpose is to develop a single set of global accounting standards. Further to the restructuring of the IASC, the new Board on 1 April 2001, as one of its first decisions, renamed the IASC as the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and, as far as future international accounting standards are concerned, renamed IAS as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These standards should, wherever possible and provided that they ensure a high degree of transparency and comparability for financial reporting in the Community, be made obligatory for use by all publicly traded Community companies.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8) and with due regard to the declaration made by the Commission in the European Parliament on 5 February 2002 concerning the implementation of financial services legislation.
(9) To adopt an international accounting standard for application in the Community, it is necessary firstly that it meets the basic requirement of the aforementioned Council Directives, that is to say that its application results in a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of an enterprise - this principle being considered in the light of the said Council Directives without implying a strict conformity with each and every provision of those Directives; secondly that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of 17 July 2000, it is conducive to the European public good and lastly that it meets basic criteria as to the quality of information required for financial statements to be useful to users.
(10) An accounting technical committee should provide support and expertise to the Commission in the assessment of international accounting standards.
(11) The endorsement mechanism should act expeditiously on proposed international accounting standards and also be a means to deliberate, reflect and exchange information on international accounting standards among the main parties concerned, in particular national accounting standard setters, supervisors in the fields of securities, banking and insurance, central banks including the ECB, the accounting profession and users and preparers of accounts. The mechanism should be a means to foster common understanding of adopted international accounting standards in the Community.
(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, the measures provided for in this Regulation, in requiring that a single set of international accounting standards be applied to publicly traded companies, are necessary to achieve the objective of contributing to the efficient and cost-effective functioning of Community capital markets and thereby to the completion of the internal market.
(13) In accordance with the same principle, it is necessary, as regards annual accounts, to leave to Member States the option to permit or require publicly traded companies to prepare them in conformity with international accounting standards adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in this Regulation. Member States may decide as well to extend this permission or this requirement to other companies as regards the preparation of their consolidated accounts and/or their annual accounts.
(14) In order to facilitate an exchange of views and to allow Member States to coordinate their positions, the Commission should periodically inform the accounting regulatory committee about active projects, discussion papers, point outlines and exposure drafts issued by the IASB and about the consequential technical work of the accounting technical committee. It is also important that the accounting regulatory committee is informed at an early stage if the Commission intends not to propose to adopt an international accounting standard.
(15) In its deliberations on and in elaborating positions to be taken on documents and papers issued by the IASB in the process of developing international accounting standards (IFRS and SIC-IFRIC), the Commission should take into account the importance of avoiding competitive disadvantages for European companies operating in the global marketplace, and, to the maximum possible extent, the views expressed by the delegations in the Accounting Regulatory Committee. The Commission will be represented in constituent bodies of the IASB.
(16) A proper and rigorous enforcement regime is key to underpinning investors' confidence in financial markets. Member States, by virtue of Article 10 of the Treaty, are required to take appropriate measures to ensure compliance with international accounting standards. The Commission intends to liaise with Member States, notably through the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), to develop a common approach to enforcement.
(17) Further, it is necessary to allow Member States to defer the application of certain provisions until 2007 for those companies publicly traded both in the Community and on a regulated third-country market which are already applying another set of internationally accepted standards as the primary basis for their consolidated accounts as well as for companies which have only publicly traded debt securities. It is nonetheless crucial that by 2007 at the latest a single set of global international accounting standards, the IAS, apply to all Community companies publicly traded on a Community regulated market.
(18) In order to allow Member States and companies to carry out the necessary adaptations to make the application of international accounting standards possible, it is necessary to apply certain provisions only in 2005. Appropriate provisions should be put in place for the first-time application of IAS by companies as a result of the entry into force of the present regulation. Such provisions should be drawn up at international level in order to ensure international recognition of the solutions adopted,","{'title': 'Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAim\n\nThis Regulation has as its objective the adoption and use of international accounting standards in the Community with a view to harmonising the financial information presented by the companies referred to in Article 4 in order to ensure a high degree of transparency and comparability of financial statements and hence an efficient functioning of the Community capital market and of the Internal Market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation, ""international accounting standards"" shall mean International Accounting Standards (IAS), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and related Interpretations (SIC-IFRIC interpretations), subsequent amendments to those standards and related interpretations, future standards and related interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nAdoption and use of international accounting standards\n\n1.

approving benzoic acid as an existing active substance for use in biocidal products for product-types 3 and 4
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes benzoic acid.
(2) Benzoic acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 3, veterinary hygiene biocidal products, and product-type 4, food and feed area disinfectants, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which correspond respectively to product-types 3 and 4 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Germany was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority reports, together with recommendations, to the Commission on 3 February 2011 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority reports were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 27 September 2013, in two assessment reports.
(5) It appears from those reports that biocidal products used for product-types 3 and 4 and containing benzoic acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve benzoic acid for use in biocidal products for product-types 3 and 4.
(7) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) For the use in product-type 4, the evaluation did not adress the incorporation of biocidal products containing benzoic acid in materials and articles intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Such materials may require the establishment of specific limits on the migration into food, as referred to in Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. The approval should therefore not cover such use unless the Commission has established such limits or it has been established pursuant to that Regulation that such limits are not necessary.
(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.

Whereas, as Community legislation currently stands, not all of the ingredients in question have been assigned an EEC number ; whereas full advantage cannot therefore be taken of the choice offered by the abovementioned labelling rule;
Whereas the Community is required to complete its rules relating to the categories of ingredients listed in Annex II to Directive 79/112/EEC ; whereas, as new Community provisions are adopted in these areas, EEC numbers that can be used in the labelling of foodstuffs will become available;

Whereas this Directive can relate only to ingredients belonging to the categories of use listed in Annex II to Directive 79/112/EEC ; whereas if, however, other categories were added to that Annex, it could also prove necessary to assign numbers to ingredients belonging to such categories;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular Article 16(2) second subparagraph thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market and amending Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes sulfuryl fluoride.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003, sulfuryl fluoride has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(3) In accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003, Sweden was designated as Rapporteur Member State. Sweden submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 19 April 2005 in accordance with Article 10(5) and (7) of that Regulation.
(4) The competent authority report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 8 September 2006, in an assessment report.
(5) The review of sulfuryl fluoride did not reveal any open questions or concerns to be addressed by the Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER).
(6) It appears from the various examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing sulfuryl fluoride may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the assessment report. It is therefore appropriate to include sulfuryl fluoride in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing sulfuryl fluoride can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(7) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance sulfuryl fluoride and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(8) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that such products be authorised only for use by trained professionals, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(e) of Directive 98/8/EC, and that risk mitigation measures are designed to ensure the safety of operators and bystanders, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(f) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(9) In addition, it is appropriate to require continuous monitoring, as well as the provision of further information on certain specific points detailed in the assessment report, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(f) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing sulfuryl fluoride to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '30.12.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 414/78', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/140/EC\nof 20 December 2006\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include sulfuryl fluoride as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 of 4 November 2003 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market and amending Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

It is therefore appropriate to include sulfuryl fluoride in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing sulfuryl fluoride can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((7)) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance sulfuryl fluoride and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n\n((8)) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that such products be authorised only for use by trained professionals, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(e) of Directive 98/8/EC, and that risk mitigation measures are designed to ensure the safety of operators and bystanders, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(f) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((9)) In addition, it is appropriate to require continuous monitoring, as well as the provision of further information on certain specific points detailed in the assessment report, in accordance with Article 10(2)(i)(f) of Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((10)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n\n((11)) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing sulfuryl fluoride to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((12)) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Transposition', 'text': 'Article 2\nTransposition\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 December 2007 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (1), and in particular points (a) and (e) of Article 5(1), and Articles 11(3) and 12(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 of 14 January 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (2) establishes a Union list of monomers, other starting substances and additives which may be used in the manufacture of plastic materials and articles. Recently the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) issued favourable scientific evaluations for additional substances which should now be added to the current list.
(2) For certain other substances, the restrictions and/or specifications already established at the EU level should be amended on the basis of a new favourable scientific evaluation by the Authority.
(3) Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4) The substance with FCM Substance Number 257 and the name dipropyleneglycol is authorised to be used as an additive in plastics in Table 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and listed with the CAS No 0000110-98-5. In Commission Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (3) this substance was referred to by CAS No 0025265-71-8. That reference was deleted upon the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 10/2011, replacing Directive 2002/72/EC, because it was considered superfluous. However, taking into account that CAS No 0025265-71-8 refers to the commercially used mixture of isomers rather than to the pure substance, it should be reinserted in Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. CAS No 0000110-98-5 should remain in Table 1.
(5) Compliance Note No (4) in Table 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 gives an ambiguous reference to simulant D, where a reference to simulant D2 is intended. Therefore, Note No (4) should refer to simulant D2.
(6) Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 should therefore be corrected accordingly.
(7) In order to limit the administrative burden to business operators, plastic materials and articles which have been lawfully placed on the market based on the requirements set out in Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and which do not comply with this Regulation should be able to be placed on the market until one year after entry into force of this Regulation.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 809/2013
of 27 August 2013
initiating a ‘new exporter’ review of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of trichloroisocyanuric acid originating in the People’s Republic of China, repealing the duty with regard to imports from one exporter in this country and making these imports subject to registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 (30 November 2009) on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the basic Regulation) (1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee in accordance with Articles 11(4) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation,
Whereas:
1.   REQUEST
(1) The European Commission (Commission) has received a request for a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.
(2) The request was lodged on 3 May 2013 by Liaocheng City Zhonglian Industry Co. Ltd (the applicant), an exporting producer in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) of trichloroisocyanuric acid.
2.   PRODUCT
(3) The product under review is trichloroisocyanuric acid and preparations thereof (TCCA), also referred to as ‘symclosene’ under the international non-proprietary name (INN), currently falling within CN codes ex 2933 69 80 and ex 3808 94 20 (TARIC codes 2933698070 and 3808942020), and originating in the People’s Republic of China.
3.   EXISTING MEASURES
(4) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 (2), under which imports into the Union of the product under review originating in the PRC, including the product produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 42,6 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned in Article 1(2) of that Regulation which are subject to individual duty rates.
4.   GROUNDS
(5) The applicant claims that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
(6) It further claims that it did not export the product under review to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (the original investigation period).
(7) Furthermore, the applicant claims that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product under review which are subject to the above-mentioned anti-dumping measures.
(8) The applicant further claims that it has begun exporting the product under review to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.
5.   PROCEDURE
(9) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the request for a review and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(10) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product under review into the Union shall be subject. Upon receipt of the claim mentioned below under recital 15, it will be determined whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation.
(11) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product under review from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011.
(a)   Questionnaires
(12) In order to obtain information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(13) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
(14) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Market economy treatment
(15) In the event that the applicant provides sufficient evidence that it operates under market economy conditions, i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. For this purpose, a duly substantiated claim must be submitted within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. The Commission will send claim forms to the applicant, as well as to the authorities of the PRC.
(d)   Selection of the market economy country
(16) In the event that the applicant is not granted market economy treatment, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. The Commission envisages using Japan again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product under review from the PRC. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(2) of this Regulation.
(17) Furthermore, in the event that the applicant is granted market economy treatment, the Commission may, if necessary, also use findings concerning the normal value established in an appropriate market-economy country, e.g. for the purpose of replacing any unreliable cost or price elements in the PRC which are needed in establishing the normal value, if reliable required data are not available in the PRC. The Commission envisages using Japan also for this purpose.
6.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(18) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product under review which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
7.   TIME-LIMITS
(19) In the interest of sound administration, time-limits should be stated within which:
(20) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit any information to be taken into account during the investigation,
(21) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,
(22) interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of Japan which, in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy treatment, is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value,
(23) the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy treatment.
(24) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party making itself known within the time-limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.
8.   NON-COOPERATION
(25) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time-limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(26) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.
(27) If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
9.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION
(28) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.
10.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(29) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).
11.   HEARING OFFICER
(30) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time-limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested party’s rights of defence are being fully exercised.
(31) A request for a hearing with the Hearing Officer should be made in writing and should specify the reasons for the request. The Hearing Officer will also provide opportunities for a hearing involving parties to take place which would allow different views to be presented and rebuttal arguments offered.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 545/2002(2), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 636/2002(4), lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported, the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds.
(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, lemons, oranges, table grapes, apples and peaches of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) Application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation, and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade, gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto.
(9) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables, quotas should be fixed for each product.
(10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(6), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(8), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(12) Owing to the market situation, in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports, the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A1, A2 and A3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 as regards export refunds on fruit and vegetables should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.
(13) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund, taking account in particular of their perishability.
(14) It should be specified that Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001, and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof, are to apply to this invitation to tender.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/2002 of 27 June 2002 opening an invitation to tender for the allocation of export licences for fruit and vegetables', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) N° 727/70 of 21 April 1970 on the common organization of  the market in raw tobacco (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC)
N° 1329/90 (2), and in  particular Article 2 (5), Article 4 (4) and (5) and Article 6 (8) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,
Whereas, when the prices for raw tobacco are fixed, account should be taken both of the objectives  of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution which the Community wishes to make to the  harmonious development of world trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy  are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure  the availability of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices;
Whereas the norm and intervention prices for leaf tobacco must be fixed in accordance with the  criteria laid down in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 727/70 in order, in particular, to  encourage producers to convert to the cultivation of those varieties which are most in demand and  most competitive as well as being the least harmful to health;
Whereas it is again desirable to fix, in respect of the 1990 harvest, derived intervention prices  both for the varieties which, before the common organization of the market came into force or, in  the case of varieties grown in Greece, Spain and Portugal, prior to accession, qualified for a  price guarantee at the baled tobacco stage and for the varieties which are grown mainly in Germany,  in order to take account of the marketing practices in that country;
Whereas Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) N° 727/70 stipulates the fixing each year, for the  following year's harvest and within an overall quantity for the Community, and in line with the  criteria specified in that Article, of a maximum guaranteed quantity for each tobacco variety or  group of varieties grown in the Community, any overrun of which leads to a proportional reduction  in the norm and intervention prices and in the premiums; whereas these maximum guaranteed  quantities must therefore be set for the 1991 harvest;
Whereas, when the provisions on the production quantity control arrangements are applied, account  should be taken of the differences in quality depending on the characteristics of the soil and the  climate; whereas those conditions are met for the varieties Badischer Burley and Paraguay; whereas  maximum guaranteed quantities should consequently be fixed for specific production areas for these  varieties;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) N° 1252/89 (6) fixes in particular the maximum guaranteed quantities for  each variety or group of varieties of tobacco from the 1990 harvest; whereas, however, in view of  the major, unforeseen changes which have occurred in the supply of and demand for certain  varieties, the maximum guaranteed quantities for certain varieties should be adjusted in the  interest of the producers;
producers;
Whereas the premium granted to purchasers of Community tobacco is intended to enable them to pay  producers of leaf tobacco a price which is at the level of the norm price, account being taken of  the trend in world market prices, and the level of prices established by the interaction of supply  and demand on the Community market;
Whereas the abovementioned prices and the amount of the amount of the premium must be fixed for  each variety produced in recognized production areas and for a reference quality defined in such a  way that as objective an assessment as possible can be made of the quality of the tobacco;
Whereas, for the 1990 harvest, the recognized production areas for each variety of tobacco should  be specified and the definitions of the reference qualities should be those laid down in Council  Regulation (EEC) No 1252/89;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1179/90 (7) provides that a
new representative rate for tobacco is to  apply from 14 May
1990 to the currencies of certain Member States;
whereasthat provision results, as from that date, in a
reduction in terms of national currency of  premiums fixed in
ecus for a substantial part of the harvest in the Member
States where the  representative rate is revalued; whereas the whole harvest in a year should be treated in the same  way in view of the characteristics of the sector; whereas that aim may be achieved if the old rate  of exchange in the Member States concerned is made applicable to premiums paid for the 1989  harvest,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1331/90 of 14 May 1990 fixing, for the 1990 harvest, the norm and intervention prices and the premiums granted to purchasers of leaf tabacco, the derived intervention prices for baled tabacco, the reference qualities, the production areas and the guaranteed maximum quantities for the 1991 harvest and amending Regulation (EEC) No 1252/89', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the 1990 harvest, the reference  qualities and recognized production areas for each of the varieties of Community-produced leaf  tobacco referred to in Article 2 (3) (b) and (c) of Regulation (EEC) N° 727/70, shall be as set out  respectively in Annexes I and III to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the 1990 harvest, the  reference qualities and recognized production areas referred to in Article 6 (3) (b) and (c) of  Regulation (EEC) N° 727/70, for each of the varieties of Community-produced baled tobacco in  respect of which a derived intervention price is fixed, shall be as set out respectively in Annexes  II and III to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Having regard to the requests made by the Member States concerned,
Whereas under the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, isolated bark of conifers originating in non-European countries may in principle not be introduced into the Community because of the risk of introducing harmful organisms;
Whereas, however, Article 14 (3) of the abovementioned Directive permits derogations from that rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms;
Whereas it has appeared that coniferous bark originating in California of the quality available there is particularly appropriate as a growing medium or part of a growing medium for orchid plants, thus reducing the number of transplanting or repotting operations necessary in the process of orchid growing;
Whereas the Commission has established on the basis of the information available at present that the risk of spreading harmful organisms, in particular Scolytidae and Bursaphelencus xylophilus through the introduction of coniferous bark originating in California for the aforementioned purpose is obviated provided that certain technical conditions are satisfied; whereas this Decision might be revised in the light of the effectiveness of certain fumigation schedules on the control of Bursaphelencus xylophilus;
Whereas the Member States concerned should therefore be authorized to provide for derogations in respect of coniferous bark originating in California under those technical conditions;

","COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 57 (2), 66 and 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
(1) Whereas the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the International Convention for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organizations (Rome Convention) lay down only minimum terms of  protection of the rights they refer to, leaving the Contracting States free to grant longer terms; whereas certain Member States have exercised this entitlement; whereas in addition certain Member States have not become party to the Rome Convention;
(2) Whereas there are consequently differences between the national laws governing the terms of protection of copyright and related rights, which are liable to impede the free movement of goods and freedom to provide services, and to distort competition  in the common market; whereas therefore with a view to the smooth operation of the internal market, the laws of the Member States should be harmonized so as to make terms of protection identical throughout the Community;
(3) Whereas harmonization must cover not only the terms of protection as such, but also certain implementing arrangements such as the date from which each term of protection is calculated;
(4) Whereas the provisions of this Directive do not affect the application by the Member States of the provisions of Article 14a (2) (b), (c) and (d) and (3) of the Berne Convention;
(5) Whereas the minimum term of protection laid down by the Berne Convention, namely the life of the author and 50 years after his death, was intended to provide protection for the author and the first two generations of his descendants; whereas the  average lifespan in the Community has grown longer, to the point where this term is no longer sufficient to cover two generations;
(6) Whereas certain Member States have granted a term longer than 50 years after the death of the author in order to offset the effects of the world wars on the exploitation of authors' works;
(7) Whereas for the protection of related rights certain Member States have introduced a term of 50 years after lawful publication or lawful communication to the public;
(8) Whereas under the Community position adopted for the Uruguay Round negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) the term of protection for producers of phonograms should be 50 years after first publication;
(9) Whereas due regard for established rights is one of the general principles of law protected by the Community legal order; whereas, therefore, a harmonization of the terms of protection of copyright and related rights cannot have the effect of  reducing the protection currently enjoyed by rightholders in the Community; whereas in order to keep the effects of transitional measures to a minimum and to allow the internal market to operate in practice, the harmonization of the term of protection  should take place on a long term basis;
(10) Whereas in its communication of 17 January 1991 'Follow-up to the Green Paper - Working programme of the Commission in the field of copyright and neighbouring rights' the Commission stresses the need to harmonize copyright and neighbouring rights  at a high level of protection since these rights are fundamental to intellectual creation and stresses that their protection ensures the maintenance and development of creativity in the interest of authors, cultural industries, consumers and society as  a whole;
(11) Whereas in order to establish a high level of protection which at the same time meets the requirements of the internal market and the need to establish a legal environment conducive to the harmonious development of literary and artistic creation in  the Community, the term of protection for copyright should be harmonized at 70 years after the death of the author or 70 years after the work is lawfully made available to the public, and for related rights at 50 years after the event which sets the  term running;
(12) Whereas collections are protected according to Article 2 (5) of the Berne Convention when, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their content, they constitute intellectual creations; whereas those works are protected as such, without  prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections, whereas in consequence specific terms of protection may apply to works included in collections;
(13) Whereas in all cases where one or more physical persons are identified as authors the term of protection should be calculated after their death; whereas the question of authorship in the whole or a part of a work is a question of fact which the  national courts may have to decide;
(14) Whereas terms of protection should be calculated from the first day of January of the year following the relevant event, as they are in the Berne and Rome Conventions;
(15) Whereas Article 1 of Council Directive 91/250/EEC of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer programs (4) provides that Member States are to protect computer programs, by copyright, as literary works within the meaning of the Berne  Convention; whereas this Directive harmonizes the term of protection of literary works in the Community; whereas Article 8 of Directive 91/250/EEC, which merely makes provisional arrangements governing the term of protection of computer programs, should  accordingly be repealed;
(16) Whereas Articles 11 and 12 of Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property (5) make provision for minimum terms of protection  only, subject to any further harmonization; whereas this Directive provides such further harmonization; whereas these Articles should accordingly be repealed;
(17) Whereas the protection of photographs in the Member States is the subject of varying regimes; whereas in order to achieve a sufficient harmonization of the term of protection of photographic works, in particular of those which, due to their  artistic or professional character, are of importance within the internal market, it is necessary to define the level of originality required in this Directive; whereas a photographic work within the meaning of the Berne Convention is to be considered  original if it is the author's own intellectual creation reflecting his personality, no other criteria such as merit or purpose being taken into account; whereas the protection of other photographs should be left to national law;
(18) Whereas, in order to avoid differences in the term of protection as regards related rights it is necessary to provide the same starting point for the calculation of the term throughout the Community; whereas the performance, fixation, transmission,  lawful publication, and lawful communication to the public, that is to say the means of making a subject of a related right perceptible in all appropriate ways to persons in general, should be taken into account for the calculation of the term of  protection regardless of the country where this performance, fixation, transmission, lawful publication, or lawful communication to the public takes place;
(19) Whereas the rights of broadcasting organizations in their broadcasts, whether these broadcasts are transmitted by wire or over the air, including by cable or satellite, should not be perpetual; whereas it is therefore necessary to have the term of  protection running from the first transmission of a particular broadcast only; whereas this provision is understood to avoid a new term running in cases where a broadcast is identical to a previous one;
(20) Whereas the Member States should remain free to maintain or introduce other rights related to copyright in particular in relation to the protection of critical and scientific publications; whereas, in order to ensure transparency at Community  level, it is however necessary for Member States which introduce new related rights to notify the Commission;
(21) Whereas it is useful to make clear that the harmonization brought about by this Directive does not apply to moral rights;
(22) Whereas, for works whose country of origin within the meaning of the Berne Convention is a third country and whose author is not a Community national, comparison of terms of protection should be applied, provided that the term accorded in the  Community does not exceed the term laid down in this Directive;
(23) Whereas where a rightholder who is not a Community national qualifies for protection under an international agreement the term of protection of related rights should be the same as that laid down in this Directive, except that it should not exceed  that fixed in the country of which the rightholder is a national;
(24) Whereas comparison of terms should not result in Member States being brought into conflict with their international obligations;
(25) Whereas, for the smooth functioning of the internal market this Directive should be applied as from 1 July 1995;
(26) Whereas Member States should remain free to adopt provisions on the interpretation, adaptation and further execution of contracts on the exploitation of protected works and other subject matter which were concluded before the extension of the term  of protection resulting from this Directive;
(27) Whereas respect of acquired rights and legitimate expectations is part of the Community legal order; whereas Member States may provide in particular that in certain circumstances the copyright and related rights which are revived pursuant to this  Directive may not give rise to payments by persons who undertook in good faith the exploitation of the works at the time when such works lay within the public domain,","{'title': 'Council Directive 93/98/EEC of 29 October 1993 harmonizing the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDuration of authors' rights\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Chronic wasting disease has been reported in farmed and wild deer and elk in Canada and the United States of America. So far, no native cases of the disease have been confirmed elsewhere.
(2) In its opinion of 6 and 7 March 2003 the Scientific Steering Committee recommended reinforced protection of animal and public health in the Community from the risk posed by chronic wasting disease in cervids in Canada and the United States of America.
(3) As Canada and the United States of America do not appear on the list of third counties approved to export non-domestic ruminant animals to the Community laid down in Council Decision 79/542/EEC drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat (2), the export of live cervids from these countries to the Community is already precluded.
(4) Council Directive 92/65/EEC laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(1) to Directive 90/425/EEC (3) specifies that only semen, ova and embryos of certain named species may be imported into the Community. Cervid species are not included. Therefore the import of semen, embryos and ova of cervid animals to the Community is already precluded.
(5) Measures should be introduced to minimise the potential public and animal health risk posed by the importation of fresh meat, meat products and meat preparations of farmed and wild cervids.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2587/2001(2), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 12(6) and Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, compensatory aid to Community producers for any loss of income is calculated on the basis of the difference between the flat-rate reference income and the average production income from bananas produced and marketed in the Community during the year in question.
(2) Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 of 9 July 1993 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the aid scheme to compensate for loss of income from marketing in the banana sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 471/2001(4), fixes the flat-rate reference income at EUR 64,03 per 100 kilograms net weight of green bananas ex-packing shed.
(3) In 2002, the average production income, calculated on the basis of the average of the prices for bananas marketed outside the producer regions at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading (goods not unloaded), on the one hand, and the selling prices on local markets for bananas marketed in their producer region, on the other, less the flat-rate amounts laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, was less than the flat-rate reference income fixed for 2002. The compensatory aid to be granted in respect of 2002 should be fixed accordingly.
(4) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, supplementary aid is granted in one or more producer regions where the average income from production is significantly lower than the average for the Community.
(5) The annual average production income from the marketing of bananas produced in Martinique and Guadeloupe has proved to be significantly lower than the Community average during 2002. As a result, supplementary aid should be granted in the producer regions of Martinique and Guadeloupe, in accordance with the practice followed in recent years. Supplementary aid covering a percentage of the difference between the average income in the Community and the average income recorded on selling products in those regions should be fixed, using a degressive calculation method in which the first 10 % of this difference is not compensated for.
(6) The unit amount of the advances and the amount of the relevant security are established, in accordance with Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, on the basis of the aid fixed for the preceding year.
(7) Given that not all the necessary data were available, it has not hitherto been possible to determine the compensatory aid for 2002. Provision should be made for the balance of the aid for 2002 and of the advances for bananas marketed during January and February 2003 to be paid within two months of the entry into force of this Regulation.

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 provides for specific measures to promote livestock farming in  the archipelagoes of the Azores and Madeira; whereas these measures include, in the beef and veal  sector, a supplement to the special premium for male bovine animals and to the premium for  maintaining suckler cows as provided for in Articles 4b and 4d respectively of Council Regulation  (EEC) No 805/68  (5), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2417/95  (6); whereas  provision should be made for these supplements to be granted under the rules applicable to those  premium schemes;
Whereas the measures to promote beef and veal production in the Azores seek to bolster traditional  economic activities vital to the Azores archipelago; whereas one such traditional activity in the  beef and veal sector consists of the production of animals for fattening in other regions of the  Community; whereas provision should therefore be made in order that the supplement to the special  premium may also be paid to the Azores livestock producer prior to shipment of the animals;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 provides for specific measures to promote livestock farming in  the French overseas departments; whereas these measures include, in the beef and veal sector,  derogations from the premium schemes provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 805/68, and a supplement  to the special premium for male bovine animals and to the premium for maintaining suckler cows;  whereas provisions should be made therefore for the basic premium and the supplement to be granted  in the French overseas departments under the rules applicable to those premium schemes, and, where  necessary, for the derogations provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91;

Whereas, in order to meet the requirements of the development of livestock farming in the French  overseas departments, a specific reserve of rights to the suckler cow premium applicable in those  territories should be established; whereas, in view of the specific nature of the territories, the  task of laying down the conditions for allocating or reallocating rights under that reserve should  be entrusted to the competent authorities, which must first notify them to the Commission; whereas,  however, the legitimate interests of producers to whom individual rights to the premium have  already been granted pursuant to Article 4d of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 must be preserved;
Whereas a large proportion of the applications for premiums in the overseas departments had already  been submitted on the date of application of this Regulation; whereas the annual nature of the  administration of the premium schemes means that different arrangements cannot be adopted which  would apply only at the end of the year; whereas consequently the derogations provided for in  Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91, in particular the non-application of the stocking density requirements  requirements in the territory, should be extended to all eligible applications submitted for 1995;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas;
A. Procedure
1. In October 1985 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Confederation of European Typewriter Manufacturers (CETMA) on behalf of German and Italian producers of electronic typewriters representing substantially all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the opening of the proceeding which was accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2). The proceeding concerned all kinds of electronic typewriters falling within Common Customs Tariff subheadings ex 84.51 A or ex 84.52 B, corresponding to NIMEXE codes 84.51 ex 12, ex 14, ex 19 and ex 20, and 84.52 ex 95, originating in Taiwan.
2. The Commission officially so advised the exporter and import known to be concerned and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
3. One producer/exporter made its views known in writing.
4. No submissions were made by Community purchasers of the product in question.
5. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out an investigation at the premises of Brother International Europe Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom.
6. The investigation of dumping covered the period 1 January to 31 December 1985.
B. Result of the investigation
7. The investigation has established that, during the period investigated, imports of the product in question were declared, for customs purposes as being of Taiwanese origin and were sold in the Community on this basis.
8. Although the electronic typewriters referred to above were shipped from Taiwan to the Community, it was ascertained during the investigation that the operation carried out in Taiwan were not sufficient to confer Taiwanese origin on the products within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 802/68 (3); the cost of these operations was found to be less than that which would constitute the last major transformation required by Regulation (EEC) No 802/68 to confer Taiwanese origin on the goods in question.
9. In the absence therefore of imports of electronic typewriters of Taiwanese origin during the period under investigation, the proceeding should be terminated,",{'title': '86/193/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 May 1986 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electronic typewriters originating in Taiwan'}

Parties therefore agreed to proceed with the adaptation of tariff concessions within the framework of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (1) (hereinafter called the Agreement), which entered into force on 1 June 2002. The adaptation of these concessions, which are listed in Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement, include notably the opening of a Community tariff quota for the import of live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg.

The procedures for adopting bilaterally a decision to amend Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement will not be completed immediately. In order to ensure that quota benefit is available until the entry into force of the said decision and for reasons of simplification, it is appropriate to open this tariff-quota concession on an autonomous and transitional basis.

(d) Development courses throughout the UK of 100-900 hours taking the form of full-time training or part-time training spread over three years.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas certain processing operations which, before the entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 2763/83, could be carried out on the basis of equivalent national arrangements, are not included in the Annex to the said Regulation; whereas the operations concerned involve the processing of certain petroleum products into products which may be given favourable tariff treatment within the meaning of Commission Regulations (EEC) No 1535/77 (3) and (EEC) No 1775/77 (4), and the processing of dichromium trioxide into chromium;
Whereas there exists an economic need for these kinds of processing operations to be allowed to continue under the arrangements for processing under customs control because the Community industry concerned has invested considerable sums in such operations; whereas, in the case of dichromium trioxide, it is necessary to ensure a sufficient supply of chromium for Community industry, notably the aircraft industry;
Whereas it is necessary to maintain the competitiveness of the industries concerned in relation to processing firms in non-member countries in order to avoid the danger of cessation of these economic activities within the Community;
Whereas a need has arisen, furthermore, to include under the arrangements for processing under customs control the usual forms of handling which may be carried out in a customs warehouse or a free zone, in accordance with Directive 71/235/EEC (5);
Whereas therefore the list in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2763/83 should be supplemented by including in it the operations referred to in the temporary measures adopted by means of Commission Regulations (EEC) No 283/85 (6) and (EEC) No 630/85, which were valid for six months only;
Whereas it is also necessary to make certain clarifications to the abovementioned list,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2110/85 of 25 July 1985 amending the list in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2763/83 as regards arrangements for processing under customs control', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe list annexed to Regulation (EEC) No 2763/83 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular the second paragraph of Article 101 thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 22 January 2007, the Council authorised the European Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine for the conclusion of a new Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine to replace the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (1).
(2) Taking into account the close historical relationship and progressively closer links between the Parties, as well as their desire to strengthen and widen relations in an ambitious and innovative way, the negotiations on the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part (hereinafter ‘the Agreement’) were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Agreement in 2012.
(3) On 15 May 2013, the European Commission proposed to the Council that the Agreement should be signed on behalf of the Union and applied in part between the Union and Ukraine on a provisional basis in accordance with Article 486 of the Agreement, pending its conclusion at a later date.
(4) The signature and conclusion of the Agreement is subject to a separate procedure as regards matters falling under the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Whereas the present monetary situation, which features major rapid changes in certain Community currencies, and the fact that there is no monetary adjustment system mean that peas, field beans and sweet lupins, harvested in the Community cannot be  disposed of under normal conditions; whereas those difficulties should be forestalled by introducing a system of differential amounts to be charged or granted in respect of the products used; whereas the said differential amounts should take into  account the incidence of the actual exchange rates on the prices of the products in question in the various Member States;
Whereas adjustments should be provided for only in cases where the monetary gaps give rise to trade flows which disrupt or threaten to disrupt the market; whereas provision should therefore be made for a neutral margin when applying the differential  amounts, and to amend therefore Regulation (EEC) No 2036/82 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3527/86 (5),

amending Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC on the Community's financial contribution to the TSE eradication and monitoring programmes for 2005
(notified under document number C(2005) 1550)
(2005/413/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 24(5) and (6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2004/696/EC of 14 October 2004 on the list of programmes for the eradication and the monitoring of certain TSEs qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005 (2) sets out the list of such programmes, as well as the proposed rate and amount of the contribution for each programme.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/863/EC of 30 November 2004 approving the TSE eradication and monitoring programmes of certain Member States for 2005 and fixing the level of the Community’s financial contribution (3).
(3) On 28 January 2005, a Community expert panel, chaired by the Community Reference laboratory for TSEs (CRL), confirmed the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a goat slaughtered in France. It was the first case of BSE in a small ruminant under natural conditions.
(4) In its statement of 28 January 2005, the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) stressed that the significance of that single case of BSE infection in a goat in France is yet to be assessed. In order to do so, the EFSA indicated that the results of an increased monitoring of TSEs in goats are essential.
(5) In response to that statement, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (4), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2005 (5), introduced a new programme for the monitoring of TSE in caprine animals starting from 11 February 2005. Under that new monitoring programme, the numbers of healthy slaughter and dead-on-farm caprine animals to be tested have been substantially increased.
(6) Due to the particularities of the goat meat sector, the limited value of goats above 18 months of age for slaughter purposes, and in the light of the importance of an effective implementation of the increased monitoring to assess the prevalence of BSE in caprine animals, it is appropriate to increase the amount per test to be reimbursed to the Member States by the Community up to a maximum amount of EUR 30 per rapid test performed in caprine animals.
(7) In addition, Regulation (EC) 999/2001, as amended Commission Regulation (EC) No 36/2005 (6) sets out the compulsory systematic discriminatory testing to differentiate BSE from scrapie in all TSE cases detected in ovine and caprine animals to apply from 14 January 2005. That measure should be considered as eligible for the Community’s financial contribution to the TSE monitoring and eradication programmes in the Member States.
(8) In the light of the importance to assess the prevalence of BSE in small ruminants for the achievement of Community objectives in the field of public and animal health it is appropriate to reimburse 100% of the costs paid by the Member States for the primary molecular tests to differentiate BSE from scrapie.
(9) Therefore, it is necessary to revise the maximum amount of financial participation by the Community for each programme, as set out in Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC.
(10) Decision 2004/863/EC sets out the conditions for the Community’s financial contribution, including the forwarding of a monthly report to the Commission by the concerned Member States on the progress of the TSE monitoring programmes and the cost paid. The Annex to that sets out the costs to be paid. That Annex should be amended to take account of amendments to Annexes III and X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 36/2005 and No 214/2005.
(11) Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '4.6.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 141/24', 'title': ""COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 May 2005\namending Decisions 2004/696/EC and 2004/863/EC on the Community's financial contribution to the TSE eradication and monitoring programmes for 2005\n(notified under document number C(2005) 1550)\n(2005/413/EC)"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2004/696/EC of 14 October 2004 on the list of programmes for the eradication and the monitoring of certain TSEs qualifying for a financial contribution from the Community in 2005(2)sets out the list of such programmes, as well as the proposed rate and amount of the contribution for each programme.\n\n((2)) Commission Decision 2004/863/EC of 30 November 2004 approving the TSE eradication and monitoring programmes of certain Member States for 2005 and fixing the level of the Community’s financial contribution(3).\n\n((3)) On 28 January 2005, a Community expert panel, chaired by the Community Reference laboratory for TSEs (CRL), confirmed the detection of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a goat slaughtered in France.

(2) An analysis of the data on quantities of bananas marketed in the Community in 2000, and in particular on actual imports during the first quarter of that year, and on the outlook for supply and consumption on the Community market during the first quarter of 2001 indicates that, with a view to satisfactory supplies for the Community as a whole, an indicative quantity of 26 % of the quantity allocated to that origin in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2362/98 should be fixed.
(3) The same data indicate that the maximum quantity for which each operator may submit licence applications for the first quarter of 2001 should be fixed pursuant to Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2362/98.
(4) In accordance with Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2374/2000 of 26 October 2000 on imports of bananas under the tariff quotas and of traditional ACP bananas for 2001(5), the quantities for which traditional operators registered in respect of 1999 may submit applications for import licences for a given quarter of 2001 are to be determined on the basis of the reference quantity fixed for 1999 by the competent national authority and notified to them. In the case of newcomer operators, that maximum quantity is to be determined by applying the set percentage to the annual allocation determined by the competent national authority in accordance with the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2598/2000 and notified to each operator concerned.

Whereas, in accordance with the agreements concluded with various Mediterranean third countries, the Community may decide that the entry prices for certain fruit and vegetables originating in such countries should vary, taking account of the annual  reviews of trade flows by product and country pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 451/89 of 20 February 1989 concerning the procedure to be applied to certain agricultural products originating in various Mediterranean third countries (2);
Whereas an examination of the outlook for export flows from Mediterranean third countries in the light of the overall trend on the Community market points to the need for the entry prices for oranges, clementines, mandarins and other similar citrus  hybrids, lemons and tomatoes to vary;
Whereas the variation in the entry price must, for each product concerned, relate to the amount to be deducted as customs duties from the representative prices recorded in the Community for the calculation of the entry price referred to in Article 24 of  Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3669/93 (4); whereas, depending on the product and origin, reductions, as appropriate, of  two-thirds or five-sixths during trading periods will enable the desired objective to be attained; whereas such reductions must apply within the quantitative limits determined, in accordance with the Mediterranean agreements;
Whereas this variation in the entry prices is to apply in respect of specific quantities which must be entered in the accounts during the periods laid down in the agreements; whereas such entry in the accounts must take place through the statistical  monitoring introduced for the administration of quotas;
Whereas the Commission must inform the Member States as soon as the quantities laid down in the Mediterranean agreements and quoted in this Regulation have been reached;
Whereas, as a result of the agriculture agreement concluded in the Uruguay Round negotiations, the variation in entry prices should not be applied until that agreement enters into force;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 91/629/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.
(2) Most Member States have ratified the European Convention for the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. The Community has also approved this Convention, by Council Decision 78/923/EEC (5).
(3) Calves, being live animals, are included in the list of products set out in Annex I to the Treaty.
(4) The keeping of calves is an integral part of agriculture. It constitutes a source of revenue for part of the agricultural population.
(5) Differences which may distort conditions of competition interfere with the smooth running of the organisation of the common market in calves and calf products.
(6) There is therefore a need to establish common minimum standards for the protection of rearing calves or calves for fattening in order to ensure rational development of production.
(7) It is recognised scientifically that calves should benefit from an environment corresponding to their needs as a herd-living species. For that reason, they should be reared in groups. Calves, both group-housed and individually penned, should have sufficient space for exercise, for contact with other cattle and for normal movements when standing up or lying down.
(8) It is necessary for official services, producers, consumers and others to be kept informed of developments in this field. The Commission should therefore, on the basis of an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, pursue actively scientific research into the most efficient stock-farming system(s) from the point of view of the well-being of calves. Provision should accordingly be made for an interim period to enable the Commission to complete this task successfully.
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6).
(10) This Directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States relating to the time limits for transposition into national law of the Directives set out in Annex II, Part B,","{'header': '15.1.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 10/7', 'title': 'COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2008/119/EC\nof 18 December 2008\nlaying down minimum standards for the protection of calves\n(Codified version)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Directive 91/629/EEC of 19 November 1991 laying down minimum standards for the protection of calves(3)has been substantially amended several times(4).

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 22 of Directive 97/78/EC, the necessary measures must be adoped as regards the import of certain products from third countries where any cause likely to constitute a serious danger for animal or human health appears or is spreading.
(2) A Community inspection to Peru has shown serious deficiencies with regard to hygiene in bivalve mollusc production areas, and has demonstrated that there are insufficient guarantees about the efficiency of the controls carried out by the competent authorities.
Nevertheless, the Community inspection team has identified that the controls on eviscerated Pectinidae harvested from certain aquaculture areas and on the adductor muscles of non-aquaculture Pectinidae completely separated from the viscera and gonads, are sufficient to assure the safety of these products. There is a risk for public health with regard to the imports of bivalve molluscs from or originating in Peru, and it is thus appropriate to suspend them with immediate effect, with the exception of the Pectinidae products, under certain conditions.
(3) Considering the seriousness of the shortcomings identified during the inspection, the provisions of this Decision must be also applied to the products which have been dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force.
Furthermore, Pectinidae harvested form certain aquaculture areas and eviscerated and, the adductor muscles of non-aquaculture Pectinidae completely separated from the viscera and gonads, dispatched to the Community before the entry into force of this Decision and presented for importation into the Community after its entry into force, should be checked in order to demonstrate the absence of marine biotoxins.

(2) The Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (2) (‘the Convention’) lays down provisions on the origin of goods traded under relevant agreements concluded between the contracting parties.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals(1), and in particular Article 22(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 implements the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure (PIC procedure) for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and pesticides in International Trade, signed on 11 September 1998 and approved by the Community by Council Decision 2003/106/EC(2).
(2) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 consists of three parts containing, respectively, the list of chemicals subject to the export notification procedure, the list of chemicals qualifying for PIC notification and the list of chemicals subject to the PIC procedure in accordance with the Rotterdam Convention.
(3) In the light of Commission Decisions 2004/141/EC(3), 2004/248/EC(4), 2004/140/EC(5) and 2004/247/EC(6), taken within the framework of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7), which ban or severely restrict the chemicals amitraz, atrazine, fenthion and simazine respectively, these chemicals should be added to the lists of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003.
(4) The chemicals nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylate are severely restricted for industrial use by Directive 2003/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(8). Furthermore, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002 of 20 November 2002 extending the time period referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to that Directive and the withdrawal of authorisation for plant protection products containing these substances(9), nonylphenol ethoxylate has been excluded from Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and authorisations for plant protection products containing it were to be withdrawn by 25 July 2003. Accordingly, both chemicals should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003.
(5) At its 10th session from 17 to 21 November 2003, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) for the Convention decided that the chemicals DNOC and the asbestos fibres amosite, antophyllite, actinolite and tremolite should also be subject to the interim PIC procedure. Accordingly, these substances should be added to the list of chemicals contained in Part 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 and the existing entries in Parts 1 and 2 should be amended.
(6) At the same session, the INC decided that the dustable powder formulations containing a combination of benomyl at or above 7 per cent, carbofuran at or above 10 per cent and thiram at or above 15 per cent should also become subject to the interim PIC procedure. Accordingly such formulations should also be added to the list of chemicals contained in Parts 1 and 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003.
(7) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.

of 18 March 2004
suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China
(2004/264/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1)(the basic Regulation), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), and in particular Article 14(4) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) The Commission, by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC(3), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China (PRC), falling under CN code ex 2704 00 19 (the product concerned). The amount of the anti-dumping duty is equal to the fixed amount of EUR 32.6 per tonne of dry net weight.
(2) In view of the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community on 23 July 2002, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 963/2002(4), Regulation as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1310/2002(5), decided that anti-dumping proceedings initiated pursuant to Commission Decision No 2277/96/ECSC(6), Decision as last amended by Decision No 435/2001/ECSC(7), and still in force shall be continued and be governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation with effect from 24 July 2002. Likewise, any anti-dumping measures resulting from pending anti-dumping investigations shall be governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation from 24 July 2002.
(3) In December 2002, the Commission initiated an interim review at the request of Eucoke-EEIG (the applicant), lodged on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm, in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation.
(4) After the applicant had withdrawn the complaint, the Commission has proposed to the Council that the interim review should be terminated.
(5) However, during the investigation of the interim review concerning the period from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002 (the investigation period), information on a change of market conditions occurred after the investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003) which might justify the suspension of the measures currently in force, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, was provided to the Commission. Consequently, the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted.
B. GROUNDS
(6) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that, in the Community interest, anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension, provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.
(7) During the interim review investigation, a number of interested parties have alleged that in the time since the investigation period, the market situation has changed dramatically. The allegations were based on a shortage of supply of the product concerned and the high level of prices charged by the traders on the Community market.
(8) In view of the seriousness of these allegations, the Commission has carried out a further investigation to assess the recent evolution of volumes and prices of the product concerned for the period between 1 October 2002 and 30 September 2003. All parties concerned were given an opportunity to present their views. All interested parties cooperated with the new investigation, the users to a somewhat lesser extent.
(9) With regard to the information provided by a cooperating importer and confirmed by the users, an increase ranging from 20 % to 50 % in the price of the product concerned imported from the PRC has been reported for the period examined. This price trend was also confirmed by the Community industry. The steel industry, which is not an interested party in this proceeding, also reported an increase of 76 % in prices of all types of coke.
(10) Considering that the Community users do not buy the product concerned directly from the PRC but from traders which do not make an accurate distinction according to the origin of the product, the information on the volume of the product concerned was based on the findings of a specialised magazine called The Coke Market Report, recognised as a reliable source of information for the coke market. This publication reported a decrease of imports from PRC from 15,5 million tonnes for all types of coke in 2002 to 12 million tonnes in 2003, i.e. a decrease of 23 %. This decrease is mainly the result of a recent change in the policy of the Chinese authorities which have decided to direct the Chinese production to the domestic market in order to meet an increasing domestic demand, by reducing the number of export licences granted to the Chinese exporters. A further decrease in imports from PRC of 6,5 million tonnes is expected for the year 2004, although this information has not yet been confirmed as the Chinese authorities have still to issue the licenses. In view of the decreasing number of export licenses issued by the Chinese authorities, a further increase of 19 % in the price of the product concerned is expected in 2004. Since the significant change in supplies of the product concerned is the result of a change in the policy applied by the Chinese authorities, there is no information which would allow the Commission to assume that these changes are of a lasting nature.
(11) With regard to the Community industry, it is to be noted that since the imposition of the measures in 2000, the situation of the Community industry has improved. The sales and production volumes decreased slightly as did the Community consumption, but sales prices increased significantly. Investments increased by a third and employment by 10 %. Only the market share remained stable (33 %) but this was due to the emergence of new exporting countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland, while the Chinese market share decreased by more than 10 percentage points and represented 9 % of the Community market in the investigation period. The profit situation also improved, although it has not yet achieved the 10,5 % profit targeted by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC. The Community industry has, however, gained 17 percentage points since the year 2000 and became profitable during the investigation period. Furthermore, as to the situation after the investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003), it is worth noting that, although the Community producers have reported an increase in production and sales on the Community market of 20 % and 40 % respectively, bearing in mind that the Community producers only produce one third of the Community market demand for the product concerned, the imports from the PRC remain vital to supply the Community market.
C. CONCLUSION
(12) In conclusion, given the temporary change in market conditions, and in particular the high level of prices of the product concerned practised on the Community market, which is far above the injurious level found in the original investigation, together with the alleged shortage of supply of the product concerned, it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension which would be in the interest of the Community. It is therefore proposed to suspend the measures in force for a period of nine months in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation.
(13) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in force. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment. The Community industry did not oppose the suspension of the anti-dumping measures in force.
(14) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently, the anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC should be suspended for a period of nine months.
(15) The Commission will continue to monitor the development of imports and the prices of the product concerned. Should a situation arise at any time in which increased volumes at dumped prices of the product concerned from the PRC resume and consequently cause injury to the Community industry, the Commission will reinstate the anti-dumping duty by repealing the present suspension,","{'title': ""2004/264/EC: Commission Decision of 18 March 2004 suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces larger than 80 mm in maximum diameter, falling within CN code ex 2704 00 19 (TARIC code 2704 00 19 10 ), and originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby suspended for a period of nine months.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 March 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 305, 7.11.2002, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 316, 15.12.2000, p. 30.\n\n(4) OJ L 149, 7.6.2002, p. 3.\n\n(5) OJ L 192, 20.7.2002, p. 9.\n\n(6) OJ L 308, 29.11.1996, p. 11.\n\n(7) OJ L 63, 3.3.2001, p. 14.'}]}"

(3) In the light of the experience acquired so far and the absence of a permanent Community act on the safety of lighters, it is necessary to confirm the validity of the Decision for a further 12 months.
(4) Decision 2006/502/EC bans the placing on the market of non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters as of 11 March 2007.

Transitional periods are also required for the Member States to ensure that the measures are efficiently applied. Consequently, the ban on supplying non-child-resistant lighters and novelty lighters to consumers should apply one year after the date of application of the ban on placing such products on the market.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1472/2002(4), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 23(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2006/923/EC (2) approved a financial contribution from the Union for a programme of measures introduced by Portugal aiming in 2006 and 2007 at controlling the spread of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode) to other Member States. The measures included the creation of a barrier free from all host trees of the pinewood nematode vector, hereinafter the ‘clear cut belt’.
(2) The financial contribution granted by Decision 2006/923/EC was based on the programme for further actions for pinewood nematode (hereinafter: PWN) and the budget estimation referring to this programme as submitted by Portugal to the Commission on 28 July 2006.
(3) The final payments to Portugal connected to the actions laid down in Decision 2006/923/EC occurred in June 2008.
(4) By Commission Implementing Decision 2011/851/EU (3), an additional Union co-financing of EUR 3 986 138,36 was granted to Portugal to cover eligible expenditure in excess to the initial estimate of July 2006.
(5) At the time of that additional Union co-financing, the claim submitted by Portugal did not include all the bills related to the creation of the clear cut belt.
(6) By letter of 5 December 2011, the Portuguese authorities introduced a revised claim of EUR 15 000 932,08. That claim included EUR 4 915 405,87 that had not been paid at the time of the previous audit of July 2010 (audit SANCO/10/2010) and could not be declared eligible for co-financing at that time. The rest of that new claim is composed of costs for felling an increased number of large coniferous trees and of a separate expenditure for the elimination of small coniferous trees.
(7) In March 2012, the Commission carried out an audit on the information communicated by Portugal on 5 December 2011. After examination of all supporting documents for the additional claim, and based on the report of that audit, the Commission concluded that an eligible amount of only EUR 5 044 839,72 of paid invoices (including coordination costs) could be taken into consideration. The rest of the claimed expenditure has not been found eligible for co-financing because it concerns expenditure already co-financed by Implementing Decision 2011/851/EU (EUR 2 024 128,16) and expenditure of EUR 7 931 964,20 related to small trees, the necessity of which has not been sufficiently justified by Portugal.
(8) As the measures included in that additional claim are of the same nature, and target the same purpose as the measures of Decision 2006/923/EC, it is appropriate to allocate the same Union financial contribution rate as in that decision, namely a rate of 75 %.
(9) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), plant-health measures are financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For the purpose of financial control of these measures, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of the above Regulation should apply.
(10) In accordance with Article 75 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5) and Article 90(1) of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (6), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated, setting out the essential elements of the action involving the expenditure.
(11) The present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided in the co-financing request presented by Portugal.

(1) The Commission decided on 16 May 2000 to reform the management of external aid programmes as part of the global reform of the Commission.

The objective is to improve the efficiency of aid management and the quality of operations, as well as to accelerate the programming, identification and implementation of programmes and projects.
(4) In this context it is necessary to strengthen both the human resources as well as the physical infrastructure of the Commission's external delegations.
(5) In this process the costs for these personnel will be borne by using a proportion of Part BA lines of expenditure in the budget relating to the programmes outside the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) regions.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof, in conjunction with Article 300(2), first sentence thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement between the European Community and the United States of America on customs cooperation and mutual assistance in customs matters (1) (CMAA) provides for the possibility of its expansion with a view to increasing the levels of customs cooperation and supplementing them by means of agreements on specific sectors or matters.
(2) The Commission has negotiated on behalf of the Community an agreement with the United States of America intensifying and broadening the CMAA to include cooperation on container security and related matters (the Agreement).
(3) The Agreement expands the customs cooperation between the Community and the United States of America to cover container security and related matters. It envisages the prompt and successful expansion of the Container Security Initiative to all ports in the Community that meet relevant requirements. The Agreement also sets out a work programme for further implementation measures, including the development of standards for risk management techniques, information required to identify high-risk shipments imported into the Parties, and industry partnership programmes.
(4) The external coordination of customs control standards with the United States of America is necessary to ensure supply chain security while guaranteeing the continued flow of legitimate trade in containers. In particular, it is essential to ensure that all Community ports can participate in the Container Security Initiative on the basis of uniform principles and that comparable standards are promoted in United States (US) ports. Thus, the direct aim and content of the Agreement concerns the facilitation of legitimate trade between the Community and the United States of America while ensuring on a reciprocal basis a high level of security by allowing for cooperation in developing actions in specific control areas in respect of which the Community has competence.
(5) Member States should have the possibility to expand the Container Security Initiative to all Community ports through arrangements with the United States of America identifying Community ports that participate in the Container Security Initiative and providing for the stationing of US customs officials therein or to maintain any such existing declarations of principles to that end, provided these arrangements are in conformity with the Treaty and compatible with the CMAA as expanded by the Agreement.
(6) It is necessary to ensure close cooperation between the Member States and the Community institutions for the purpose of further intensification and broadening of the customs cooperation under the CMAA as expanded.
(7) To that end a consultation procedure should be established whereby Member States envisaging to negotiate arrangements with the United States of America on matters covered by the CMAA as expanded would immediately notify such intention and provide the relevant information. If so requested by a Member State or the Commission within short time limits the information should be the subject of consultations between the Member States and the Commission.
(8) The main purpose of the consultations should be to facilitate the exchange of information and to ensure that the arrangements are consistent with the Treaty and with common policies, in particular the common framework of cooperation with the United States of America set out in the CMAA as expanded.
(9) Where the Commission considers that an arrangement that a Member State wishes to implement with the United States of America is incompatible with the CMAA as expanded or that the subject matter should be addressed in the framework of the CMAA as expanded, it should inform the Member State accordingly.
(10) The consultation procedure should be without prejudice to the respective competencies of the Member States and the Community to conclude the arrangements envisaged.
(11) The Agreement should be approved,","{'header': '30.9.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 304/32', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 30 March 2004\nconcerning the conclusion of the

of 17 January 2006
amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include warfarin as active substance
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1) and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes warfarin.
(2) For warfarin the effects on human health and the environment has been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (3), Ireland was designated as Rapporteur Member State. Ireland submitted the relevant assessment report and recommendations to the Commission on 8 May 1996 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(3) The assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 23 September 2005 in the format of the Commission review report for warfarin.
(4) The report on warfarin and further information were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants. The Committee was asked to comment on the acceptability of using clinical data generated following repeated warfarin use as an anti-coagulant in human medicine for establishing an acceptable daily intake (ADI) and an acceptable operator exposure level (AOEL). In its opinion (4), the Scientific Committee concluded that it is not necessary to allocate an ADI for warfarin. Furthermore, data available from the extensive clinical use of warfarin as an anticoagulant may confidently be expected to support the establishment of an ADI, should this be considered necessary. An AOEL can likewise be established based on human data, taking into account that in rats about 15 % of the applied dose is absorbed through the skin.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made, that plant protection products containing warfarin may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include warfarin in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisation of plant protection products containing warfarin can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(6) Warfarin is used as a rodenticide. All other active substances used as rodenticides are covered by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1112/2002 of 20 June 2002 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (5). Furthermore, the substance is currently subject to evaluation in the framework of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (6). As with all substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, the status of warfarin could be reviewed under Article 5(5) of that Directive in the light of any new data becoming available, in particular from the assessment of similar substances or from the assessment of warfarin itself under Directive 98/8/EC.
(7) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties, it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(9) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing warfarin to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '18.1.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 12/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/5/EC\nof 17 January 2006\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include warfarin as active substance\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Whereas the imports fair 'Partners in Progress' is organized every year in Berlin with a view to improving the access to world markets of products originating in countries benefiting from generalized preferences;
Whereas, in view of the specific features of the Berlin Fair and of the unique situation of Berlin, certain measures should be taken in the field of generalized preferences;
Whereas, in accordance with the offer made in the context of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the Community opened generalized preferences commencing in 1971 and most recently under Regulations (EEC) No 3896/89 (1) and (EEC) No 3897/89 (2) and in particular in respect of finished and semi-finished industrial and textile products originating in developing countries;
Whereas, in the past, certain products covered by the system of quotas, ceilings or other tariff measures, being the subject of contracts for sale in the course of the Berlin Fair, have not been able to benefit from the preferences, the allocated tariff quotas or fixed duty-free amounts having been used up or the collection of customs duties having been re-established for products subject to ceiling limits before the opening date of the fair; whereas it is important to provide additional latitude to countries benefiting from generalized preferences to enable them to benefit from the generalized tariff preference for products being the subject of contracts for sale at the fair; whereas, however, this latitude should be limited to 6 % of the levels of the tariff measures applicable for each product or group of products under the abovementioned annual Regulations, and should be opened;
Whereas, without prejudice to the specific provisions of this Regulation, the application of the provisions of the annual Regulations regarding generalized tariff preferences and, in particular, in respect of the beneficiary countries and the concept of originating products should be applied to the supplementary preferences in question;
Whereas it is appropriate, however, to exclude from the scope of this Regulation certain products originating in particular beneficiary countries;
Whereas declarations of release into free circulation submitted with a view to the importation of the products in question should be accompanied by the certificate of origin and the contract concluded at the Berlin Fair, the latter certified by the competent German authorities;
Whereas the German authorities must ensure that certification of the contracts concluded at the Berlin Fair do not exceed the authorized supplementary quantities;
Whereas the method of administration adopted requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission,
Whereas the generalized preferences have been suspended for products originating in the Republic of Korea by Regulations (EEC) No 3896/89 and (EEC) No 3897/89,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1274/90 of 7 May 1990 applying supplementary generalized tariff preferences in respect of certain industrial products originating in countries benefiting from generalized preferences and sold at the Berlin ""Partners in Progress"" Fair', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

on the reclassification of hip, knee and shoulder joint replacements in the framework of Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices (1), and in particular Article 13(1)(b) thereof,
Having regard to the request submitted by France and the United Kingdom,
Whereas:
(1) On the basis of the classification rules set out in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, total joint replacements are class IIb medical devices.
(2) France and the United Kingdom requested the classification of total joint replacements as class III medical devices by way of derogation from the provisions of Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, in order to ensure an appropriate conformity assessment of total joint replacements before their placing on the market.
(3) Conformity assessment is based on a number of elements such as a proper classification, the designation and monitoring of the notified bodies and the proper implementation of the conformity assessment modules as described in Directive 93/42/EEC.
(4) Reclassification by derogation to the classification rules set out in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC is indicated where the shortcomings identified due to the specific characteristics of a product will be more properly addressed under the conformity assessment procedures corresponding to the new category.
(5) Hip, knee and shoulder replacements should be distinguished from other total joint replacements, due to the particular complexity of the joint function to be restored and the consequent increased risk of failure due to the device itself.
(6) In particular, hip and knee replacements are weight-bearing and extremely sophisticated implants, for which the risk of revision surgery is significantly greater than for other joints.
(7) Shoulder implants are a more recent technique, which are subject to similar dynamic forces; their possible replacement is in principle connected with serious medical problems.
(8) Furthermore, hip, knee and shoulder replacement surgery is increasingly taking place on young people with a high life expectancy; consequently, the need for such implants to function properly over the life expectancy of the patients and to reduce revision surgery and its risks has been increased.
(9) Specific clinical data, including long term performance data are not always available for hip, knee and shoulder replacements before they are placed on the market and put into service; consequently, conclusions on clinical data collected by the manufacturer in the framework of the evaluation of the conformity of these products with the requirements concerning their characteristics and performance referred to in Sections 1 and 3 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC should be subject to particular attention and examination in order to verify the appropriateness of the clinical data available.
(10) Total joint replacements can be subject to multiple modifications following their introduction into clinical use and placing on the market, as shown by hip and knee replacements on the market. However, experience has shown that what appear at first sight to be minor post-marketing changes to the design of previously trouble-free replacements can lead to serious problems due to unintended consequences, which may lead to early failure and major safety concerns.
(11) In order to achieve the optimal level of safety and health protection and to reduce the design related problems to the lowest level, the design dossier of hip, knee and shoulder replacements, including the clinical data used by the manufacturer to support the claimed performance and the subsequent post-marketing design and manufacturing changes should be examined in detail by the notified body before these devices are introduced in general clinical use.
(12) Consequently, the notified body should, under the full quality assurance system, effectively carry out an examination of the design dossier and of the changes to the approved design in accordance with point 4 of Annex II to Directive 93/42/EEC.
(13) For these reasons, it is necessary to proceed to the reclassification of hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements as class III medical devices.
(14) It is necessary to provide for an adequate transitional period for hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements already assessed as class IIb medical devices under the full quality assurance system of Annex II to Directive 93/42/EEC, allowing for their complementary assessment under point 4 of Annex II to the Directive.
(15) Hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements already certified following the procedure relating to the EC type examination set out in Annex III to Directive 93/42/EEC, coupled with the procedure relating to the EC verification set out in Annex IV or the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex V to that Directive, are not affected by the present Directive as these certification schemes are the same for both class IIb and class III medical devices.
(16) It is necessary to provide for an adequate transitional period for hip, knee and shoulder total joint replacements that have already been subject to the procedure relating to the EC type examination under Annex III to Directive 93/42/EEC coupled with the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity set out in Annex VI to that Directive, allowing for their assessment under Annex IV or Annex V to Directive 93/42/EEC.
(17) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Medical Devices set up by Article 6(2) of Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices (2),","{'header': '12.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 210/41', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2005/50/EC\nof 11 August 2005\non the reclassification of hip, knee and shoulder joint replacements in the framework of Council Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On the basis of the classification rules set out in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, total joint replacements are class IIb medical devices.\n\n((2)) France and the United Kingdom requested the classification of total joint replacements as class III medical devices by way of derogation from the provisions of Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC, in order to ensure an appropriate conformity assessment of total joint replacements before their placing on the market.\n\n((3)) Conformity assessment is based on a number of elements such as a proper classification, the designation and monitoring of the notified bodies and the proper implementation of the conformity assessment modules as described in Directive 93/42/EEC.\n\n((4)) Reclassification by derogation to the classification rules set out in Annex IX to Directive 93/42/EEC is indicated where the shortcomings identified due to the specific characteristics of a product will be more properly addressed under the conformity assessment procedures corresponding to the new category.\n\n((5)) Hip, knee and shoulder replacements should be distinguished from other total joint replacements, due to the particular complexity of the joint function to be restored and the consequent increased risk of failure due to the device itself.\n\n((6)) In particular, hip and knee replacements are weight-bearing and extremely sophisticated implants, for which the risk of revision surgery is significantly greater than for other joints.\n\n((7)) Shoulder implants are a more recent technique, which are subject to similar dynamic forces; their possible replacement is in principle connected with serious medical problems.\n\n((8)) Furthermore, hip, knee and shoulder replacement surgery is increasingly taking place on young people with a high life expectancy; consequently, the need for such implants to function properly over the life expectancy of the patients and to reduce revision surgery and its risks has been increased.\n\n((9)) Specific clinical data, including long term performance data are not always available for hip, knee and shoulder replacements before they are placed on the market and put into service; consequently, conclusions on clinical data collected by the manufacturer in the framework of the evaluation of the conformity of these products with the requirements concerning their characteristics and performance referred to in Sections 1 and 3 of Annex I to Directive 93/42/EEC should be subject to particular attention and examination in order to verify the appropriateness of the clinical data available.\n\n((10)) Total joint replacements can be subject to multiple modifications following their introduction into clinical use and placing on the market, as shown by hip and knee replacements on the market.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 3 and 9d(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for authorisation of the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 74 252) was provisionally authorised for the first time for turkeys for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 937/2001 (3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced from Penicillium funiculosum (IMI SD101) was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001 (4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets, by Regulation (EC) No 937/2001. New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106), endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) and subtilisin produced by Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 2107) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999 (5). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in the Annex, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(9) The assessment of those applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (6).

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 53(1) and Article 62 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) provides a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings of the Union. That system is essential in order to ensure a safe and solid insurance sector that can provide sustainable insurance products and support the real economy by encouraging long-term investments and additional stability.
(2) Directive 2011/89/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) makes certain amendments to Articles 212 to 262 of Directive 2009/138/EC, which are to be applicable from 10 June 2013.
(3) Directive 2012/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) amends Directive 2009/138/EC by postponing the date for transposition from 31 October 2012 to 30 June 2013, the date of application from 1 November 2012 to 1 January 2014 and the date of repeal of the existing insurance and reinsurance Directives (5) (collectively referred to as ‘Solvency I’) from 1 November 2012 to 1 January 2014.
(4) On 19 January 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal (the ‘Omnibus II proposal’) to amend, inter alia, Directive 2009/138/EC in order to take into account the new supervisory architecture for insurance, namely the setting-up of the European Supervisory Authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) (EIOPA). The Omnibus II proposal also includes provisions to postpone the date for transposition and the date of application of Directive 2009/138/EC, and the date of repeal of Solvency I, and serves as a means to adapt Directive 2009/138/EC to the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union by converting the provisions empowering the Commission to adopt implementing measures into provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated and implementing acts.
(5) Given the complexity of the Omnibus II proposal, there is a risk that it will not have entered into force before the date for transposition and the date of application of Directive 2009/138/EC. Leaving those dates unchanged would result in Directive 2009/138/EC being implemented before the entry into force of the transitional rules and of relevant adaptations, including further clarification of delegated and implementing act empowerments, provided for by the Omnibus II proposal.
(6) In order to avoid overly burdensome legislative obligations for Member States under Directive 2009/138/EC and later under the new supervisory architecture envisaged by the Omnibus II proposal, it is therefore appropriate to postpone the date for transposition and the date of application of Directive 2009/138/EC, allowing supervisors and insurance and reinsurance undertakings sufficient time to prepare for the application of that new architecture.
(7) It is evident from the chronological order of events that the postponed date for transposition and date of application of Directive 2009/138/EC should also apply to the amendments thereto which were made by Directive 2011/89/EC.
(8) For reasons of legal certainty, the date of repeal of Solvency I should be postponed accordingly.
(9) Given the very short period of time before the relevant dates laid down in Directive 2009/138/EC, this Directive should enter into force without delay.
(10) Consequently, it is justified to apply the exception for urgent cases provided for in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union in this case as regards the transmission to national parliaments of the proposal for this Directive,","{'header': '18.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 341/1', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2013/58/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 December 2013\namending Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) as regards the date for its transposition and the date of its application, and the date of repeal of certain Directives (Solvency I)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)provides a modern, risk-based system for the regulation and supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings of the Union.
