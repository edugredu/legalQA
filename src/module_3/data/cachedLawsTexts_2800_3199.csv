Whereas:
(1) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from certain African countries are laid down by Commission Decision 1999/283/EC(3).
(2) Imports of fresh meat from South Africa are only possible from a part of the territory of this country which has been recognised by the European Community as officially free of foot-and-mouth disease.
(3) On 15 September 2000 the competent authorities confirmed on outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, in the free region.
(4) The situation is liable to seriously endanger Community livestock in view of imports of products of biungulate animals.
(5) The competent authorities of South Africa provided sufficient guarantees with regard to the measures taken to control the movement of animals of susceptible species within and out of the infected area, in particular by declaring 16 districts, around the outbreak in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, a control area for foot-and-mouth disease.
(6) It is therefore necessary to redefine the territory of South Africa from which imports into the Community of fresh meat are authorised.
(7) In addition, it appears necessary to clarify, that imports of fresh meat from Namibia are only possible from the territory South of the cordon fences which extend from Palgrave Point in the west to Gam in the east, which has bene recognised by the European Community as officially free of foot-and-mouth disease.
(8) Decision 1999/283/EC must be amended accordingly.

of 8 February 1983
concerning aid to maintain maritime employment granted to fishing undertakings by the French Government

(83/313/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 of 19 January 1976 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3443/80 (2), and in particular Article 26 thereof, and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 (3), which replaced Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 with effect from 1 June 1982, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having given notice, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2), to the parties concerned to submit their comments, and having regard to these comments,
I
Whereas, in response to a request made by the Commission on 12 October 1979, the French authorities, in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, informed the Commission by letter dated 21 April 1980 of the granting of aid in 1979 and 1980 to fishing undertakings in an attempt to maintain employment in coastal areas;
Whereas this aid amounted, in practice, to FF 0,105 for each litre of gas-oil used; whereas it was granted to all fishing undertakings; whereas the sum set aside for this aid in 1979 and 1980 was FF 53 million;
Whereas it emerged that this aid had been granted regularly in France since 1974; whereas the granting thereof in 1974 and 1975 had been authorized by the Commission; whereas the Commission had raised no objections to its renewal in 1977;
Whereas the French Government stresses that the aim of the aid in question is to mitigate the effects on the fishing fleets of the spectacular increase in running costs, the dwindling of catches the redeployment of fishing activities and the absence of the necessary Community measures, a situation which has resulted in large-scale laying-up and which could in the long term jeopardize employment in coastal areas;
Whereas the French Government has explained that the reference to fuel is used merely as a criterion for granting the aid and that the aid in question is to be considered as employment aid;
Whereas the aid described above falls within the scope of Article 92 to 94 of the EEC Treaty by virtue of the Articles of Regulations (EEC) No 100/76 and (EEC) No 3796/81 referred to above;
Whereas, following initial scrutiny, the Commission took the view that the aid in question, granted since 1974, was no longer temporary aid but operating aid granted with no actual reciprocal commitment on the part of the recipient, that it had a substantial direct impact on competition and trade between the Member States and that it was therefore incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty; whereas it accordingly decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the above aid and, to this effect, by letter of 22 July 1980, gave the French Government formal notice to submit its comments;
Whereas, in June 1981, the Commission learned of the French Government's intention to continue this aid after 1980 despite the procedure pending under Article 93 (2) and to double the rate; whereas, in response to a request made by the Commission on 3 and 27 July 1981, the French Government stated that the matter was still at the planning stage, and that the Commission would be notified at the appropriate time;
Whereas, in December 1981, the Commission learned that the French Government had in fact decided to double the aid in question with effect from July 1981; whereas, after being asked for confirmation by telex dated 22 December 1981, the French Government confirmed this information by telex dated 8 January 1982 and, in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC
Treaty, notified the extension and doubling of the aid in question for 1982, to be granted on the same basic terms; whereas the level of the aid in question was fixed at FF 0,21 per litre of fuel used and the sum set aside for the purpose was FF 106 million; whereas such notification implies that the aid in question was granted in 1981 without the Commission being notified in advance;
Whereas the Commission decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of this new aid, and, to this effect, on 25 February 1982, sent the French Government a letter giving it notice to submit its comments;
Whereas it follows from the above that the French Government clearly failed in its obligations under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty;
II
Whereas, in its replies to the Commission dated 13 October 1980 and 6 April 1982, the French Government stated that the granting of aid to maintain maritime employment in 1980, 1981 and 1982 does not distort competition, as proven by the regular increase since 1977 of French fishery imports, mostly from elsewhere in the Community, and that the aid in question is not aid for fuel as it is not indexed to the price of oil but, by contrast, is progressive in nature; whereas, despite its being doubled in 1982, the aid has in fact dropped since 1977 in terms of the price of fuel from 17 to 12 %;
Whereas the French Government claims that the aid in question is intended, pending Community decisions, to enable fishing enterprises to adapt to new fishing conditions and to prevent a probable irreversible decline in their activity, and a reduction in their income, or even a loss of jobs in areas which have little industry, are very isolated and are particularly dependent on fishing; whereas such aid is intended to be temporary; whereas, lastly, other Member States in similar situations have adopted measures which are either identical or comparable in effect;
Whereas several Member States and several sectoral organizations have submitted their comments to the Commission; whereas certain Member States and sectoral organizations share the commission's view; whereas other Member States feel that the absence of a common fisheries policy may lead Member States to introduce aids to prevent the current situation from deteriorating; whereas several sectoral organizations would like to see the granting of fisheries aids harmonized within the Community;
III
Whereas the fuel subsidies in question have a direct impact on the production costs of recipients and have given them a definite advantage over the other Community fishermen;
Whereas the fact that the aid in question has been granted since 1974 means that it is no longer temporary; whereas the Commission has made it clear to the Member States, and notably to the French authorities in 1975, that it was not in favour of the idea of extending the aids for fuel which it had authorized in the fisheries sector in 1974 and 1975;
Whereas the fact that French fishery imports are on the increase does not cancel out the impact of aid on intra-Community trade and comptetition;
Whereas the reference made by the French Government to similar aids in other Member States does not appear relevant as the mere existence of an aid scheme in one Member State is never sufficient to justify the granting of similar aid in another Member State;
Whereas intra-Community trade in fishery products for human consumption is substantial and accounts for approximately 30 % of total landings for human consumption in the Community as a whole; whereas, for its part, the French market receives approximately 60 % of its requirements from the landings made by its own fishermen, approximately 20 % from imports from non-member countries and approximately 20 % from imports from the other Member States, and France exports 16 % of its production, approximately two-thirds of which goes to the other Member States;
Whereas the aid in question is simply an aid for fuel and cannot be considered as employment aid; whereas there is no requirement regarding the use of the aid and, in particular, no link with the level of employment in the recipient undertakings;
Whereas the fact that the aid in question is not indexed to the price of oil does not mean that it is not aid for fuel;
Whereas the absence of Community decisions on the reform of the common fisheries policy does not constitute a valid reason for Member States to grant national aids;
Whereas, moreover, for a number of years all Community fishermen have been faced with a very sharp increase in the price of fuel; whereas competition on the Community market in fishery products is very keen; IV
Whereas it follows from the above that the aid introduced by the French Government is likely to affect trade between the Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty;
Whereas Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty states that aids fulfilling the criteria laid down therein are incompatible in principle with the common market; whereas exceptions to this incompatibility, which are the only exceptions relevant to the case in point, are set out in paragraph 3 of the said Article and lay down the objectives followed in the Community's interest and not only in the interest of individual sectors of the national economy; whereas these exceptions are to be strictly interpreted when scrutinizing any aid programme of a regional or sectoral nature or any individual case of application of general aid schemes; whereas exceptions may be allowed only in cases where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary for achievement of one of the objectives set out in these provisions;
Whereas to allow such exceptions in respect of aids which do not offer such a compensatory advantage would amount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without justification on grounds of Community interest and would result in unfair advantages for certain Member States;
Whereas it has not been possible to establish the existence of such a compensatory advantage in the case in point; whereas the French Government was unable to provide any evidence, and the Commission could find none, that the aids in question fulfilled the conditions required for allowing one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty;
Whereas the aid in question is clearly not designed to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas; whereas, on regional criteria, Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) is accordingly inapplicable;
Whereas such aids constitute neither an important project of common European interest nor measures capable of remedying a serious disturbance in the French economy; whereas Article 92 (3) (b) of the Treaty is accordingly inapplicable;
Whereas aid for fuel, intended as it is to reduce the cost of certain inputs, constitutes an operating aid with no lasting impact on the economic situation of the recipients; whereas, in general, the Commission has always been opposed to such aid, since, as a rule, such aid does not in itself fulfil the conditions for eligibility for the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) of the EEC Treaty, since it is not likely to facilitate the development of certain activities within the meaning of that provision;
Whereas, in its communication to the Council of 25 May 1978 on sectoral aid policy, the Commission made it clear that temporary aids to mitigate the social consequences of a crisis situation must be linked with restructuring objectives for the sector in question and subject to action by recipients to facilitate conversion; whereas this does not apply in the case of the aid in question;
Whereas it follows from the above that the aid in question does not fulfil the conditions required for eligibility for one of the exceptions under Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '83/313/EEC: Commission Decision of 8 February 1983 concerning aid to maintain maritime employment granted to fishing undertakings by the French Government (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aid to maintain maritime employment as granted to fishing undertakings in France form 1979 to 1982 is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 20 December 2010
extending the transitional period concerning the acquisition of agricultural land in Hungary
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2010/792/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, and in particular point 2 of Chapter 3 of Annex X thereto,
Having regard to the request made by Hungary,
Whereas:
(1) The 2003 Act of Accession provides that Hungary may maintain in force, under the conditions laid down therein, for a 7-year period following the accession, expiring on 30 April 2011, prohibitions on the acquisition of agricultural land by natural persons who are non-residents or non-nationals of Hungary and by legal persons. This is a temporary exception to the free movement of capital as guaranteed by Articles 63 to 66 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This transitional period may only be extended for a further 3 years.
(2) On 10 September 2010, Hungary requested to extend the transitional period concerning the acquisition of agricultural land by 3 years.
(3) The main reason for the transitional period was the need to safeguard the socioeconomic conditions for agricultural activities following the introduction of the single market and the transition to the common agricultural policy in Hungary. In particular, it aimed to meet concerns raised about the possible impact on the agricultural sector of liberalising the acquisition of agricultural land due to initial large differences in land prices and income compared with Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (hereinafter ‘the EU-15’). The transitional period was also designed to ease the process of privatisation and restitution of agricultural land to farmers, and the Commission, in its Report of 16 July 2008 on the Review of the transitional measures for the acquisition of agricultural real estate set out in the 2003 Accession Treaty (hereinafter the ‘Mid-Term Review’) already emphasised the importance of the completion of this policy by the end of the foreseen transitional period. (1)
(4) Despite the increasing convergence of land prices in Hungary with those prevailing in the EU-15 after Hungary’s accession to the European Union, a 3- to 20-fold difference in average land prices still persists according to information submitted by Hungary. Although the complete convergence in land prices was neither expected nor seen as a necessary condition for terminating the transitional period, the noticeable differences in prices between Hungary and EU-15 are such as they may still hinder smooth progress towards price convergence. Similarly, the gap between the income of agricultural workers and farmers in Hungary and income in the EU-15 decreased but continues to exist. Furthermore, according to data from Eurostat, the agricultural sector of Hungary was hit relatively severely by the recent global financial and economic crisis with real agricultural income per worker falling by the highest rate in the Union (about 30 per cent against a Union average of about 12 per cent) in 2009. Lower income has been coupled with worse credit conditions relative to those in most of the EU-15 countries, both as regards nominal interest rates and the volume of credit available for farmers. The expected increased presence in Hungary of new financial institutions from EU-15 after the accession of Hungary was hampered by the financial and economic crisis.
(5) Although the restitution process has advanced during the transitional period, it encountered difficulties in particular since 2008, and has thus not yet been completed. A similar trend can be observed as regards privatisation of agricultural land. The lack of certainty of property rights as well as underdeveloped credit and insurance facilities for farmers further weaken the Hungarian agricultural land market and still hinder its proper functioning.
(6) Against this background, it can be anticipated, as do the Hungarian authorities, that the lifting of the restrictions on 1 May 2011 would exert pressure on the land prices in Hungary. Moreover, taking into account the high number of participants, the very fragmented ownership structure of the agricultural land market, which has not changed significantly since accession, and the predominance of land leasing, the impact would likely be felt throughout the entire sector. Therefore, a threat of serious disturbances on the Hungarian agricultural land market upon the expiry of the transitional period exists.
(7) An extension of 3 years to the transitional period referred to in point 2 of Chapter 3 of Annex X to the Act of Accession should therefore be granted.
(8) In order to fully prepare the market for liberalisation, it continues to be of utmost importance, even amid adverse economic circumstances, to foster the improvement of factors such as credit and insurance facilities for farmers, and the restitution and privatisation of agricultural land during the transitional period, as already emphasised in the Mid-Term Review.
(9) Increased inflow of foreign capital into the agricultural land market also presents potential benefits for this market in Hungary. As emphasised in the Mid-Term Review, foreign investment in the agriculture sector would also have important long-term effects on the provision of capital and know-how, on the functioning of land markets and on agricultural productivity. The progressive loosening of the restrictions on foreign ownership during the transitional period would also contribute to preparing the market for full liberalisation,","{'header': '21.12.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 336/60', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 20 December 2010\nextending the transitional period concerning the acquisition of agricultural land in Hungary\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/792/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The 2003 Act of Accession provides that Hungary may maintain in force, under the conditions laid down therein, for a 7-year period following the accession, expiring on 30 April 2011, prohibitions on the acquisition of agricultural land by natural persons who are non-residents or non-nationals of Hungary and by legal persons.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to machinery(1), as amended by Directive 98/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee set up by Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Directive 98/37/EC, as amended, provides that machinery may be placed on the market and put into service only if it does not endanger the health or safety of persons and, where appropriate, domestic animals or property, when properly installed and maintained and used for its intended purpose.
(2) Machinery which conforms to harmonised standards, the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, is presumed to satisfy the essential health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of Directive 98/37/EC, as amended.
(3) Member States are required to publish the references of the national standards which transpose the harmonised standards.
(4) The references of harmonised standard EN 703:1995 ""Agricultural Machinery - Silage cutters - Safety"" were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities C 229 of 8 August 1996 in the framework of implementing Directive 98/37/EC, as amended.
(5) At present, this standard still gives a presumption of conformity.
(6) Italy has noted that many fatal accidents have occurred in its territory following the use of silage cutters manufactured in accordance with standard EN 703. Consequently, Italy has taken the view that this standard did not satisfy the essential health and safety requirements of the Directive and that its references should be withdrawn from publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities in order to no longer give a presumption of conformity with the Directive.
(7) Technical Committee CEN/TC 144 examined this problem and started work on revising this standard. In view of the significant difficulties it encountered in this revision, it has concluded that it will be several years before the revised standard can be ratified.
(8) Given the anticipated delay, it is proposed that the references of this standard be withdrawn immediately in order to avoid it being used as a harmonised standard in the future,","{'title': ""2000/693/EC: Commission Decision of 25 October 2000 on withdrawing the references of standard EN 703 'Agricultural machinery - Silage cutters - Safety' from the list of references of standards in the framework of implementing Directive 98/37/EC (notified under document number C(2000) 3104) (Text with EEA relevance)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe references of standard EN 703 ""Agricultural machinery - Silage cutters - Safety"" are withdrawn from publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 20 June 2014
abrogating Decision 2010/407/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in Denmark
(2014/406/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 13 July 2010, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Decision 2010/407/EU (1), that an excessive deficit existed in Denmark. The Council noted that according to the data notified by the Danish authorities in April 2010, the general government deficit planned for 2010 was 5,4 % of GDP, thus above the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value. The general government gross debt was expected to reach 45,1 % of GDP in 2010, well below the 60 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value. The general government deficit and debt for 2010 were subsequently revised to 2,5 % of GDP and 42,8 % of GDP, respectively.
(2) On 13 July 2010, in accordance with Article 126(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 (2), the Council, based on a recommendation from the Commission, addressed a recommendation to Denmark with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2013 at the latest. That Council recommendation was made public.
(3) In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of that Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (3).
(4) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit ought to be abrogated, the Council is to take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon (4).
(5) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, following the notification by Denmark before 1 April 2014, and on the Commission services 2014 spring forecast, the following conclusions are justified:
— The general government deficit stayed within the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value in the period 2010-2013, except in 2012 when the balance was negatively affected by a one-off reimbursement related to pension reform in 2011. The one-off reimbursement is estimated to have weakened the fiscal balance by 1,6 % of GDP in 2012. The general government deficit amounted to 2,5 % of GDP in 2010, 1,9 % of GDP in 2011, 3,8 % of GDP in 2012 and 0,8 % of GDP in 2013. The improvement of the fiscal balance was driven by consolidation measures both on the revenue and expenditure side, in particular through restricted growth in public consumption.
— Denmark's 2014 convergence programme projects a general government deficit of 1,3 % of GDP in 2014 and 2,9 % of GDP in 2015. In the period 2013-2014, public finances have been affected by one-off revenues coming from the restructuring of existing capital pensions, giving the opportunity to pay off tax liability of future capital pensions at a favourable rate. This measure is estimated to boost the fiscal balance by close to 1,8 % of GDP in both years. In 2015, this measure will have no impact, leading to an expected increase in the public finance deficit. The Commission services 2014 spring forecast projects the general government deficit to reach 1,2 % of GDP in 2014 and 2,7 % of GDP in 2015. Thus, the deficit is set to remain below the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon.
— After having improved by 0,7 % of GDP in cumulative terms between 2011 and 2013, the structural balance, that is the general government balance adjusted for the economic cycle and net of one-off and other temporary measures, is forecast to deteriorate by 0,8 % of GDP in 2014 (to – 0,2 % of GDP) and by a further 0,3 % of GDP in 2015, based on a no-policy-change assumption.
— The Commission services 2014 spring forecast projects the general government gross debt to decrease to 43,5 % of GDP in 2014 and to increase to 44,9 % of GDP in 2015, below the 60 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value.
(6) Starting from 2014, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, Denmark is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and should maintain its structural balance at or above its medium-term budgetary objective.
(7) In accordance with Article 126(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(8) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in Denmark has been corrected and Decision 2010/407/EU should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '28.6.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 190/71', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 20 June 2014\nabrogating Decision 2010/407/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in Denmark\n(2014/406/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 13 July 2010, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Decision 2010/407/EU(1), that an excessive deficit existed in Denmark.

The improvement of the fiscal balance was driven by consolidation measures both on the revenue and expenditure side, in particular through restricted growth in public consumption.—Denmark's 2014 convergence programme projects a general government deficit of 1,3 % of GDP in 2014 and 2,9 % of GDP in 2015. In the period 2013-2014, public finances have been affected by one-off revenues coming from the restructuring of existing capital pensions, giving the opportunity to pay off tax liability of future capital pensions at a favourable rate. This measure is estimated to boost the fiscal balance by close to 1,8 % of GDP in both years. In 2015, this measure will have no impact, leading to an expected increase in the public finance deficit.

Thus, the deficit is set to remain below the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon.—After having improved by 0,7 % of GDP in cumulative terms between 2011 and 2013, the structural balance, that is the general government balance adjusted for the economic cycle and net of one-off and other temporary measures, is forecast to deteriorate by 0,8 % of GDP in 2014 (to – 0,2 % of GDP) and by a further 0,3 % of GDP in 2015, based on a no-policy-change assumption.—The Commission services 2014 spring forecast projects the general government gross debt to decrease to 43,5 % of GDP in 2014 and to increase to 44,9 % of GDP in 2015, below the 60 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value.\n\n(—) The general government deficit stayed within the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value in the period 2010-2013, except in 2012 when the balance was negatively affected by a one-off reimbursement related to pension reform in 2011. The one-off reimbursement is estimated to have weakened the fiscal balance by 1,6 % of GDP in 2012.

,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank (1), and in particular Articles 5(1) and 6(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 of the European Central Bank of 22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector (ECB/2001/13) (2), requires monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to report, inter alia, monthly statistical information relating to their end-of-month balance sheets for the purposes of producing the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) provides that the accounting rules to be followed in reporting are those laid down in the national transposition of Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions (3), and in any other international standards applicable. Both national accounting legislation and international standards have changed since the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13). Directive 86/635/EEC has been amended to the effect that certain financial instruments may be valued at fair value. International accounting standards may also provide for the valuation of certain financial instruments at fair value.
(3) For the purposes of the statistical information which the European Central Bank (ECB) needs to fulfil its tasks, deposit liabilities and loans have to be reported at their nominal value.
(4) In light of the above, it has become necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) to include an explicit requirement regarding the reporting of deposit liabilities and loans at nominal value.
(5) At the same time, given the current stage in the process of harmonisation in the field of statistics that has been reached as a result of Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13), it is desirable to continue to apply the valuation rules that have until now been applied to provisioned loans and purchased loans. Therefore, national central banks may allow existing valuation rules to apply to such loans until the ECB updates these rules in order to harmonise reporting further.
(6) In view of the possibility that some MFIs may value debt securities issued at fair value, it is necessary to clarify the scope of the reporting of the ‘other revaluation’ adjustments in respect of price revaluation of securities.
(7) As a consequence of the above, Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 (ECB/2001/18) of the European Central Bank of 20 December 2001 concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions to deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations (4), should also be amended,","{'header': '18.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 371/42', 'title': 'REGULATION (EC) No 2181/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 16 December 2004\namending Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector and Regulation (EC) No 63/2002 (ECB/2001/18) concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions to deposits and loans vis-à-vis households and non-financial corporations\n(ECB/2004/21)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 of the European Central Bank of 22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector (ECB/2001/13)(2), requires monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to report,inter alia, monthly statistical information relating to their end-of-month balance sheets for the purposes of producing the consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 2423/2001 (ECB/2001/13) provides that the accounting rules to be followed in reporting are those laid down in the national transposition of Council Directive 86/635/EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions(3), and in any other international standards applicable.

(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

Having regard to the request made by the French Republic,
Whereas, under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive, seed and propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during the year 1973 in one or more of the Member States and which fulfil the conditions provided for in that Directive are, since 31 December 1975, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) thereof provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the French Republic had applied for such authorization in respect of the variety Canova (2-row barley) before expiry of the said period;
Whereas the Commission Decision of 30 June 1976 (3) extended the period provided for in the said Article 15 (1) for this variety for the French Republic to 31 December 1976;
Whereas the Commission has meanwhile completed its examination of the French application in respect of this variety;
Whereas the variety has been the subject of official growing trials in the French Republic ; whereas the results of these trials have led the French Republic to decide that this variety is not sufficiently uniform there;
Whereas in respect of this variety the results of the trials show that in the French Republic, when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there, which apply as part of current Community provisions, it is not sufficiently uniform in certain characteristics (Article 15 (3) (a) of the said Directive);
Whereas therefore the application of the French Republic in respect of this variety should be granted in full;

Whereas:
(1) The Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products (hereafter ‘the Agreement’) provides for the possibility of recognising equivalence for sanitary measures after the exporting Party has objectively demonstrated that its measures achieve the importing Party’s appropriate level of protection. The Agreement was approved on behalf of the Community by Decision 1999/201/EC.
(2) The determination of equivalence was carried out and concluded with Canada for equivalence on public health measures concerning fishery products. Equivalence has been concluded on a reciprocal basis.
(3) The Joint Management Committee established under the Agreement (‘the Joint Management Committee’), at its meeting on 5 and 6 October 2006, issued a recommendation concerning the determination of equivalence on hygiene rules for fishery products. This was complemented by a specific recommendation concerning equivalence on microbiological criteria for fishery products at the meeting of the Joint Management Committee on 3 and 4 October 2007.
(4) The Joint Management Committee, at its meeting on 5 and 6 October 2006, issued a recommendation concerning the establishment of rules for imports into the Community for fish caught under the authority of a recreational fishing licence from Canada. The Joint Management Committee, at its meeting on 5 and 6 October 2006, issued a recommendation as regards fresh meat to update the legal basis of the EU and Canadian standards.
(5) The Joint Management Committee, at its meeting on 5 and 6 October 2006, issued a recommendation as regards minced meat and to update the legal basis of the EU standards.
(6) The Joint Management Committee, at its meeting on 3 and 4 October 2007, issued a recommendation concerning the determination of equivalence for poultry post-mortem requirements on poultry meat.
(7) The Joint Management Committee, at its meeting on 27 and 28 April 2005, issued a recommendation providing for the possibility of imports from Canada of live bivalve molluscs for wet storage, relaying or depuration in the Community other than market size live bivalve molluscs, in line with Community legislation.
(8) As a result of those recommendations it is appropriate to modify the relevant parts in Annex V to the Agreement.
(9) Pursuant to Article 16(3) of the Agreement amendments to the Annexes are to be agreed upon by an exchange of notes between the Parties.
(10) Accordingly, the recommended modifications to Annex V to the Agreement should be approved on behalf of the Community.
(11) Commission Decision C(2008) 2633 of 19 June 2008, which was not published in the Official Journal of the European Union, made certain amendments to the Annex V to the Agreement.
(12) It is necessary to make certain adaptations of a diplomatic nature to the text of the letters set out in the Annex to Decision C(2008) 2633. In the interests of clarity, that Decision should be annulled and replaced by the present Decision.

As essential elements of the Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law are the basis of our relations.\n\nBy letter of 19 February 2002, the European Union informed you of its decision to conclude the consultations held under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and to take certain ""appropriate measures"" within the meaning of Article 96(2)(c) of that Agreement.\n\nBy letter of 19 February 2003, the European Union informed you of its decision not to revoke the application of the ""appropriate measures"".\n\nToday, after a further 12-month period, the European Union considers that democratic principles are still not upheld in Zimbabwe and that no progress has been achieved by the Government of Zimbabwe in the five fields addressed by the 18 February 2002 Council Decision (end of politically motivated violence, free and fair elections, freedom of the media, independence of the judiciary, end of illegal farm occupations). Furthermore, the European Union notes that the Government of Zimbabwe has not taken any positive steps along the lines of the measures, considered as benchmarks to assess progress, which the European Union communicated to the SADC on the occasion of the last two SADC/EU Committee meetings.\n\nIn the light of the above, the European Union does not consider that the appropriate measures can be revoked.\n\nThe measures will only be revoked once conditions prevail which ensure respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. The European Union reserves the right to take additional restrictive measures.\n\nThe European Union will closely follow developments in Zimbabwe and would once again like to emphasise that these measures do not penalise the Zimbabwean people and will continue with its contribution to operations of a humanitarian nature and projects in direct support of the population, in particular those in social sectors, democratisation, respect for human rights and the rule of law, which are not affected by these measures. For the season 2003-2004 the European Community contribution to food and humanitarian aid operations in Zimbabwe has amounted to EUR 85 million in addition to bilateral assistance provided by the Member States of the European Union.\n\nThe European Union desires to pursue the dialogue with Zimbabwe, on the basis of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, and hopes that you will do everything you can to restore respect for the essential principles of the Partnership Agreement and to put the country on the path of social peace and economic recovery. This would permit the lifting of the suspension of the signing of the 9th EDF National Indicative Programme for Zimbabwe, thereby making possible the resumption of full cooperation instruments in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor the Commission\n\n>PIC FILE= ""L_2004050EN.006103.TIF"">\n\nFor the Council\n\n>PIC FILE= ""L_2004050EN.006104.TIF"">'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional measures
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 699/88 (3) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of oxalic acid originating in Taiwan or South Korea.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) After the provisional anti-dumping duty had been imposed, some of the parties concerned, including the complainant (DAVSA), made known their views concerning that duty.
Some of them also asked to be informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission proposed to recommend definitive measures. Those requests were granted.
C. Dumping
(3) No new evidence of dumping has been received since the provisional duty was imposed. The Commission accordingly considers the results of the investigation set out in Regulation (EEC) No 699/88 to be definitive.
D. Injury
(4) No new evidence concerning injury to the Community industry has been presented.
The Commission accordingly confirmed the conclusions concerning injury set out in Regulation (EEC) No 699/88.
(5) The Commission accordingly believes that the facts as definitively established show that the dumped imports of oxalic acid originating in Taiwan and South Korea must be considered to have caused material injury.
E. Community interest
(6) No new information concerning the Community interest has been submitted since the provisional duty was imposed and the Commission's conclusions concerning the Community interest set out in Regulation (EEC) No 699/88 therefore remain unchanged.
In those circumstances, definitive anti-dumping measures must be imposed on imports of oxalic acid originating in Taiwan or South Korea in order to protect the Community interest.
F. Undertaking
(7) When Uranus Chemicals Co. Ltd, Hsin Chu, Taiwan, was informed that the main conclusions of the preliminary investigation concerning the product originating in Taiwan had been confirmed, it gave an undertaking concerning its exports to the Community.
The main effect of the undertaking is to bring the prices of exports to the Community up to a level which the Commission considers sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by the imports concerned, given the prices of those imports and the margin by which they undercut the internal Community threshold price needed to guarantee an efficient Community producer sufficient income to enable him to continue his activities.
In those circumstances, the undertaking given is considered acceptable and the proceeding can accordingly be terminated without a definitive anti-dumping duty being imposed on imports from the exporter concerned.
The Advisory Committee did not oppose that solution,","{'title': '88/353/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 June 1988 accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of oxalic acid originating in Taiwan or South Korea and terminating the investigation with regard to the exporter concerned', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking given by Uranus Chemicals Co.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC (1), and in particular Article 27(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The competitiveness of European maritime transport can be facilitated through a more efficient use of resources and better use of electronic information.
(2) For reasons of maximising efficiency and avoiding duplication of efforts, there is a need to build on existing national and Union platforms, technical solutions and on standardisation, reaping also the benefits of investments already made.
(3) The Union Maritime Information and Exchange system, SafeSeaNet, established in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC, apart from enhancing maritime safety, port and maritime security, environmental protection and pollution preparedness, allows for the exchange, in accordance with Union legislation, of additional information aiming at facilitating efficient maritime traffic and maritime transport
(4) In order to enable cost savings, avoid creating multiple Steering Groups and take advantage of the experience of the HLSG, its management principles and its tasks should be adjusted to cover additional areas covered by the Directive.
(5) Directive 2002/59/EC requires Member States and the Commission to cooperate to develop and update the Union Maritime Information and Exchange system, on the basis of the experience gained in operating the system, its potential and its functions, with a view to enhancing it, taking into account developments in information and communication technologies.
(6) Experiences have been gained and technical advancements have been made, in particular in developing an interoperable data exchange system which can combine information from SafeSeaNet with information from the other Union monitoring and tracking systems (CleanSeaNet, the European Union Long-Range Identification and Tracking of Ships European Data Centre (EU LRIT Data Centre) and Thetis), and also from external systems (e.g. satellite AIS), further enabling integrated maritime services. Several satellite AIS initiatives have been launched, including by Member States, confirming the operational benefits from having access to SAT-AIS data.
(7) The EMSA hosted systems and applications are able to provide Member States' authorities and Union bodies, comprehensive information on, for example, ship positions, dangerous cargoes, pollution, etc., as well as provide support services in areas such as coast guards, anti-piracy and, statistics, in accordance with the access rights attributed in compliance with the Interface and Functionalities Control Document (IFCD) established and maintained under Article 22a and Annex III of the Directive.
(8) The management of the system and its technological enhancements are regularly discussed with Member States in the SafeSeaNet High Level Steering Group (HLSG) established by Commission Decision 2009/584/EC (2). Improvements made resulting in the technical integration of the various systems and applications developed are also discussed by this group. These advancements and the testing of an integrated maritime data environment by the European Maritime Safety Agency have produced synergies, improved systems features and services.
(9) Annex III to Directive 2002/59/EC should therefore be adapted to reflect these technical advancements made in light of experience gained with SafeSeaNet.
(10) Annex III to the VTMIS Directive which covers the Union Maritime Information and Exchange system and refers to other relevant Union legislation, should be made more explicit by specifying those Union acts in regard to which SafeSeaNet is currently used, such as Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Directive 2010/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6); in regard to the mentioned legal acts, the use of SafeSeaNet can further facilitate the exchange and sharing of information and should further facilitate the use of the system, the integrated information system and a platform to ensure the convergence and interoperability of maritime systems and applications, including space-based technologies.
(11) The developments reflected in this Directive can also play a central role in the development of a Common Information and Sharing Environment (CISE) for the maritime domain, which is a voluntary collaborative process in the European Union seeking to further enhance and promote relevant information sharing between authorities involved in maritime surveillance.
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS),","{'header': '29.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 308/82', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2014/100/EU\nof 28 October 2014\namending Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community\xa0vessel traffic monitoring and information system\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The competitiveness of European maritime transport can be facilitated through a more efficient use of resources and better use of electronic information.\n\n((2)) For reasons of maximising efficiency and avoiding duplication of efforts, there is a need to build on existing national and Union platforms, technical solutions and on standardisation, reaping also the benefits of investments already made.\n\n((3)) The Union Maritime Information and Exchange system, SafeSeaNet, established in accordance with Directive 2002/59/EC, apart from enhancing maritime safety, port and maritime security, environmental protection and pollution preparedness, allows for the exchange, in accordance with Union legislation, of additional information aiming at facilitating efficient maritime traffic and maritime transport\n\n((4)) In order to enable cost savings, avoid creating multiple Steering Groups and take advantage of the experience of the HLSG, its management principles and its tasks should be adjusted to cover additional areas covered by the Directive.\n\n((5)) Directive 2002/59/EC requires Member States and the Commission to cooperate to develop and update the Union Maritime Information and Exchange system, on the basis of the experience gained in operating the system, its potential and its functions, with a view to enhancing it, taking into account developments in information and communication technologies.\n\n((6)) Experiences have been gained and technical advancements have been made, in particular in developing an interoperable data exchange system which can combine information from SafeSeaNet with information from the other Union monitoring and tracking systems (CleanSeaNet, the European Union Long-Range Identification and Tracking of Ships European Data Centre (EU LRIT Data Centre) and Thetis), and also from external systems (e.g. satellite AIS), further enabling integrated maritime services.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/37/EC provides that each unit packet of tobacco products, except for tobacco for oral use and other smokeless tobacco products, and any outside packaging, with the exception of additional transparent wrappers, must carry an additional warning from the list set out in Annex I to that Directive.
(2) Those additional warnings have been mandatory on all packages of smoking tobacco since September 2003 and on packages of other tobacco products since September 2004.
(3) Evidence suggests that the impact of current additional warnings set out in Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC has decreased over time as the novelty effect of the warning messages has worn off.
(4) In addition, new scientific evidence on the health effects of tobacco use and the principles of effective tobacco labelling has emerged since the adoption of Directive 2001/37/EC. In particular, there is evidence that smoking plays a causal role in mouth and throat cancer, visual impairments as well as dental and gum disease. There is also evidence that parental smoking is a major risk factor for smoking initiation.
(5) Article 9(2) of Directive 2001/37/EC provides that the Commission shall adapt to scientific and technical progress the health warnings set out in Annex I of the same Directive. Furthermore, guidelines on tobacco packaging and labelling (2) adopted by the Third Conference of the Parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in November 2008 recommend that legal measures for packaging and labelling of tobacco products should be reviewed periodically and updated as new evidence emerges and as specific health warnings and messages wear out.
(6) A revision of the current additional warnings set out in Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC is therefore needed in order to maintain and increase their impact, and to take into account the new scientific developments.
(7) This revision should be based on the results of the review of existing knowledge on tobacco labelling and the health effects of tobacco use and of testing of the warnings made in all Member States.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Regulatory Committee established under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/37/EC and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,","{'header': '8.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 69/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2012/9/EU\nof 7 March 2012\namending Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/37/EC provides that each unit packet of tobacco products, except for tobacco for oral use and other smokeless tobacco products, and any outside packaging, with the exception of additional transparent wrappers, must carry an additional warning from the list set out in Annex I to that Directive.\n\n((2)) Those additional warnings have been mandatory on all packages of smoking tobacco since September 2003 and on packages of other tobacco products since September 2004.\n\n((3)) Evidence suggests that the impact of current additional warnings set out in Annex I to Directive 2001/37/EC has decreased over time as the novelty effect of the warning messages has worn off.\n\n((4)) In addition, new scientific evidence on the health effects of tobacco use and the principles of effective tobacco labelling has emerged since the adoption of Directive 2001/37/EC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2931/79 of 20 December 1979 on the granting of assistance for the exportation of agricultural products which may benefit from a special import treatment in a third country(1), and in particular Article 1(2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(2), and in particular Articles 26(3) and 31(14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2729/81 of 14 September 1981 laying down special rules implementing the system of import and export licences and the advance fixing of refunds in respect of milk and milk products(3) provides that for the purposes of applications for licences with advance fixing of the refund submitted under a tendering procedure opened in a non-member country, the only invitations to tender that may be considered are those issued by public agencies or bodies governed by public law appearing on the list attached to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2730/81 of 14 September 1981 establishing a list of agencies in non-member importing countries entitled to issue invitations to tender in the milk and milk products sector(4). This provision was reproduced in Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1466/95 of 27 June 1995 laying down special detailed rules of application for export refunds on milk and milk products(5), which repeals Regulation (EEC) No 2729/81. Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(6), which replaces Regulation (EC) No 1466/95, makes no further reference to Regulation (EEC) No 2730/81 and provides in Article 8 that proof that the agency is public or subject to public law will henceforth be furnished by the trader. Regulation (EEC) No 2730/81 has therefore become devoid of purpose and may be repealed.
(2) Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2931/79 provides that when agricultural products are exported which may, under agreements concluded by the Community, qualify for special treatment on importation into a third country if certain conditions are met, the competent authorities of the Member States will, on request and after appropriate checks are made, issue a document certifying that the conditions have been met. In accordance with that Regulation, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3305/82 of 9 December 1982 laying down detailed rules for the provision of administrative assistance in connection with the export of cheeses eligible for special treatment on import into Norway(7) requires exporters to present a certificate attesting to the Community origin of the cheeses exported. Paragraph 4(1) of Annex IV to the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Norway concerning certain arrangements in agriculture(8) provides that products will benefit from the Agreement upon submission of either a movement certificate EUR.1 or an invoice. Regulation (EEC) No 3305/82 may therefore be repealed since the presentation of the certificate referred to in Article 1 thereof is no longer required.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3439/83 of 5 December 1983 laying down special conditions for the export of certain cheeses to Australia(9) provides for a special certificate to be presented to the authorities of that country attesting that the Community cheeses imported have benefitted from a lower refund than those set for other destinations. With the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1776/96 of 12 September 1996 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products(10) refunds for cheeses exported to Australia are no longer fixed and consequently Regulation (EEC) No 3439/83 has become devoid of purpose and may be repealed.

Whereas Protocol No 7 to the Interim Agreeemnts provides for a proportionate reduction in the quantities available for 1992 to take account of the period which has elapsed between the beginning of 1992 and the entry into force of the Arrangements on 1  March; whereas the actual quantities which may imported in 1992 should therefore be fixed at ten twelfths of the annual quantities;
Whereas the abovementioned Agreements provide for a reduction in the import levy for fresh, chilled or frozen beef falling within CN codes 0201 and 0202, limited to certain quantities; whereas, in order to ensure the regularity of imports, it is  important to spread out the aforesaid quantities throughout the year;
Whereas provision is also made for the quantities of meat exported from one of the three beneficiary countries in the context of triangular operations receiving Community financial assistance to be deducted from the available quantities; whereas,  therefore, provision should be made for calculation mechanisms to take account of these operations;
Whereas, while recalling the provision of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the product, the management of the system should be ensured through import licences; whereas, with that in mind, it would be appropriate to define, in  particular, the detailed rules for submission of applications, as well as the information which must be included on the applications and licences, notwithstanding certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying  down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1599/90 (8), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 of 4  September 1980 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 815/91 (10); whereas provision should also be made for the licences to be  issued after a delay for consideration and, where necessary, with the application of a single percentage reduction;

Whereas, when laying down the detailed rules for the lodging of applications and the issuing of licences, derogations should be made both from Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the  application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2101/92 (8), and from Commission Regulation (EEC) No 574/86 of 28 February 1986 laying down  detailed rules for the application of the supplementary trade mechanism (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3296/88;
Whereas in order to simplify the procedure for issuing STM licences an automatic system of issue should be laid down along with the introduction of a tighter notification system and a mechanism for monitoring the use of the licences issued;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;

Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;
Whereas the establishment of a common energy policy is one of the objectives the Communities have set themselves;
Whereas crude oil and petroleum products are of increasing importance in providing the Community with supplies of energy ; whereas any difficulty, even temporary, having the effect of considerably reducing supplies of such products could cause serious disturbances in the economic activity of the Community ; whereas the Community must, therefore, be in a position to offset or at least to diminish any harmful effects in such a case;
Whereas procedures and appropriate instruments should be provided in advance to ensure the speedy implementation of measures to mitigate the effects of difficulties in the supply of petroleum and petroleum products;
Whereas all Member States should, therefore, possess the necessary powers to take appropriate action, should the need arise, without delay and in accordance with the Treaty, and in particular Article 103 thereof;

Having regard to Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products,
Whereas:
(1) Following the publication of a scientific study in 2001, entitled ‘Use of permanent hair dyes and bladder cancer risk’, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers, replaced by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), by Commission Decision 2004/210/EC (2), concluded that the potential risks were of concern. It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.
(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.
(4) Substances for which no updated safety files are submitted allowing an adequate risk assessment should be included in Annex II.
(5) However 4,4′-Diaminodiphenylamine and its salts; 4-Diethylamino-o-toluidine and its salts; N,N-Diethyl-p-phenylenediamine and its salts; N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and its salts; and Toluene-3,4-Diamine and its salts, are currently listed under reference numbers 8 and 9 in Annex III, Part 1, which are general entries.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 permits the granting of private storage aid for sheep's milk cheeses requiring at least six months for maturing where a serious market imbalance could be eliminated or reduced by seasonal storage.
(2) The seasonal nature of Pecorino Romano cheese production results in the building up of stocks which are difficult to sell and which risk causing a lowering of prices. Seasonal storage should therefore be introduced for the quantities to improve the situation and allow producers time to find outlets for their cheese.
(3) The detailed rules of this measure should determine the maximum quantity to benefit from it as well as the duration of the contracts in relation to the real requirements of the market and the keeping qualities of the cheeses in question. It is necessary to specify the terms of the storage contract so as to enable the identification of the cheese and to maintain checks on the stock in respect of which aid is granted. The aid should be fixed taking into account storage costs and the foreseeable trend of market prices.
(4) Article 1(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 of 30 June 1993 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 569/1999(3), fixes the conversion rate to be applied in the framework of private storage aid schemes in the milk products sector.
(5) Experience shows that provisions on checks should be laid down, particularly as regards the documents to be submitted and checks to be made on the spot. Therefore, it should be provided that Member States require the costs of checks be fully or partly borne by the contractor.
(6) It is appropriate to guarantee the continuation of the storage operations in question.

amending Decision 2001/865/EC authorising the Kingdom of Spain to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 of the Sixth Council Directive (77/388/EEC) on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive (77/388/EEC) of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes – Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (1), and in particular Article 27(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2001/865/EC (2) the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain, by way of derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, to include in the taxable amount of a supply of goods or a supply of services the value of any gold used by the supplier and provided by the recipient in cases where the supply of the gold to the recipient is exempt in accordance with Article 26b of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(2) The aim of that derogation was to avoid abuse of the exemption for investment gold and thus to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.
(3) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 4 August 2004, the Spanish Government requested an extension of the validity of Decision 2001/865/EC, which expires on 31 December 2004.
(4) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 9 August 2004 of the request made by the Kingdom of Spain. By letter dated 10 August 2004, the Commission notified the Kingdom of Spain that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.
(5) According to the Spanish authorities, the derogation authorised by Decision 2001/865/EC has been effective in achieving the aims stated above.
(6) The derogations pursuant to Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC which counter VAT avoidance linked to the exemption for investment gold may be included in a future proposal for a Directive rationalising some of the derogations pursuant to that Article.
(7) It is therefore necessary to extend the validity of the derogation granted under Decision 2001/865/EC until the entry into force of a Directive rationalising the derogations pursuant to Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC which covers the avoidance of value added tax linked to the exemption for investment gold, or until 31 December 2009, whichever is the earlier.
(8) The derogation will have no negative impact on the Community’s own resources provided from VAT,","{'header': '16.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 369/60', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 December 2004\namending Decision 2001/865/EC authorising the Kingdom of Spain to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 of the Sixth Council Directive (77/388/EEC) on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes\n(2004/854/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 2001/865/EC(2)the Council authorised the Kingdom of Spain, by way of derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, to include in the taxable amount of a supply of goods or a supply of services the value of any gold used by the supplier and provided by the recipient in cases where the supply of the gold to the recipient is exempt in accordance with Article 26b of Directive 77/388/EEC.\n\n((2)) The aim of that derogation was to avoid abuse of the exemption for investment gold and thus to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.\n\n((3)) By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 4 August 2004, the Spanish Government requested an extension of the validity of Decision 2001/865/EC, which expires on 31 December 2004.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 9 August 2004 of the request made by the Kingdom of Spain.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
After consulting the Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of personal data (2),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States' laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations, and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25(2) thereof.
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) The Bailiwick of Jersey is one of the dependencies of the British Crown (being neither part of the United Kingdom nor a colony) that enjoys full independence, except for international relations and defense which are the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government. The Bailiwick of Jersey is therefore to be considered as a third country within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC.
(6) With effect from 1951 and 1987 respectively, the United Kingdom's ratification of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (Convention No 108) were extended to the Bailiwick of Jersey.
(7) As regards the Bailiwick of Jersey, the legal standards on the protection of personal data largely based on the standards set out in Directive 95/46/EC have been provided for in the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 1987, which entered into force on 11 November 1987 and two ancillary laws, the Data Protection (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2005, and the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005 (Appointed Day) Act 2005.
(8) Secondary legislation has also been adopted under the authority of the Data Protection (Jersey) Law, in 2005, laying down specific rules concerning issues such as subject access, processing of sensitive data and notification to the data protection authority (3).
(9) The legal standards applicable in Jersey cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons. The application of these standards is guaranteed by judicial remedy and by independent supervision carried out by the authority, the Data Protection Commissioner, who is invested with powers of investigation and intervention.
(10) Jersey should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(11) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC,","{'header': '28.5.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 138/21', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 8 May 2008\npursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data in Jersey\n(notified under document number C(2008) 1746)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/393/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC, Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States' laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.\n\n((2)) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection.

Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the unit production aid must be reduced where the actual production in a given marketing year exceeds the guaranteed maximum quantity fixed for that marketing year; whereas, however, producers  whose average production does not amount to 500 kilograms of olive oil per marketing year are not afected by such a reduction;
Whereas Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined;  whereas that amount must be fixed at a level avoiding any risk of unwarranted payment to olive growers;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Measures in force
(1) In February 1998, by Regulation (EC) No 368/98(2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the People's Republic of China. The rate of the definitive duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, amounted to 24,0 %.
2. Request for a review
(2) On 19 June 1998, a request for a review of the abovementioned measures was lodged pursuant to Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the ""basic Regulation""). The lodging was made on behalf of the Community producers whose collective output of glyphosate constituted a major proportion of the total Community production of that product within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the basic Regulation, namely Cheminova Agro (Denmark), Monsanto Europe (Belgium) and Zeneca Agrochemicals (United Kingdom).
(3) In the request, it was alleged that the abovementioned anti-dumping measures had led to no movement, or insufficient movement, in resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community. To this effect, the complainants submitted sufficient evidence showing that export prices had actually fallen following the imposition of the said measures which had made no impact on resale and subsequent selling prices in the Community.
B. REVIEW INVESTIGATION PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 12 OF THE BASIC REGULATION
1. Initiation of the review pursuant to Article 12
(4) On 6 August 1998, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of a review, pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation, of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of glyphosate originating in the People's Republic of China, and commenced an investigation.
(5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producers, of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
(6) The Commission services sent questionnaires to all exporters known to be concerned, namely: Beixi City Chemical Plant, Beixi (Liaoning); Shanghai Union Chemical, Shanghai; Panyu Chemical Factory, Panyu (Guangzhou); Samning City Pesticide Factory, Sanming City (Fujian); Zhangjiagang No 2 Pesticide, Jiangsu; Haiyan Pesticide Factory, Haiyan (Zhejiang); Guangzhou Pesticide Factory, Guangzhou; Hainan Pesticide Factory, Haikou City (Hainan); Anyang Pesticide Factory, Anyang (Henan); Taixin Huangqiao Chemical Factory, Sanliu Bridge Village (Jiangsu); Nantong Chemical Plant, Nantong (Jiangsu); Suzhou Chemical &  Pesticide, Suzhou (Jiangsu); Taichung Pesticide Factory, Taichung (Jiangsu); Wujin Pesticide Factory, Changzhou City (Jiangsu); Chuan Xi Chemical Plant, Deyang City (Sichuan); Shifang Chemical Group Pesticide Factory, Shuangsheng (Sichuan); Longyou Pesticide Factory, Longyou Town (Zhejiang); Ningbo No 2 Chemical Plant, Ningbo (Zhejiang); CAC Chemical Co. Ltd, Shanghai; Fujian Sannong Chemistry Co. Ltd, Xubi-Sanming (Fujian); Zhangjiagang No 2 Pesticide Factory, Nansha Town (Jiangsu); Tide International Co. Ltd, Hangzhou; Sinochem Ningbo Imp &  Exp Corp., Ningbo; Sinochem Jiangsu Imp &  Exp Corp., Nanjing; Sinochem Heilongjiang Imp &  Exp Corp., Harbin; Sinochem International Chemicals Co., Beijing; Sinochem Liaoning Imp &  Exp Corp., Dalian; Sinochem Tianjin Imp &  Exp Corp., Tianjin; Hubei Sanonda Co. Ltd, Shashi (Hubei); Shenjen Jiangshan Commerce &  Industrial Group, Shenzhou; China International Trust Investment Corp. (""CITIC""), Beijing; Quickett, Hong Kong; High Kite Ltd, Hong Kong, and Rotam, Hong Kong.
(7) No replies to the questionnaire were received from the abovementioned exporters and producers except for Fujian Sannong Chemistry Co. Ltd and Jiangsu Zhejiang Jiangnan Chemical Factory, which reported no exports to the Community during the new investigation period (as defined in recital 10), Hubei Sanonda Co. Ltd, which reported having stopped producing glyphosate since the year 1997, and Zhenjiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Co. Ltd which claimed that it was one of the largest Chinese manufacturers and exporters of glyphosate to the Community during the investigation period.
(8) On 23 September 1999, the sole cooperating exporter, Zhenjiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Co. Ltd requested individual treatment and submitted some information to support its claim. The Commission deemed such information insufficient and sent a specific individual treatment questionnaire to the Chinese company concerned. No reply was made to this questionnaire.
(9) Questionnaires were also sent to independent importers known to have imported glyphosate from the People's Republic of China so as to ascertain the resale prices of the product concerned before and after the imposition of the anti-dumping duties. Replies to the questionnaires were received from the following unrelated importers:
- Feinchemie Schwebda GmbH, Germany,
- Herbex Produtos QuĂ­micos SA, Portugal,
- Industrias Afrasa SA, Spain, and
- Calliope SA, France.
Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the abovementioned unrelated importers.
(10) The investigation period of this review runs from 1 January 1998 to 30 June 1998. This investigation period was used to determine the current level of export prices and resale and subsequent selling prices charged after the imposition of anti-dumping measures to see whether the measures had achieved the intended effects in terms of increased import prices for the product under consideration.
(11) In establishing whether resale and subsequent selling prices had moved sufficiently, the price levels charged in the investigation period were compared to those charged during the original investigation period which had covered the period from 1 September 1994 to 31 August 1995.
(12) Owing to the volume of data gathered and examined, in particular in view of the complexity of the analysis of the movement of the resale and subsequent selling prices, and the fact that normal values were re-examined, the investigation exceeded the normal period of six months provided for in Article 12(4) of the basic Regulation.
2. Product concerned
(13) The product concerned by the request, and for which the review was initiated, is the same as in the original investigation, i.e. glyphosate currently classifiable within CN codes ex29310095 (2931 00 80 until 31 December 1997) and ex38083027, the latter when put up in forms or packing for retail use or as preparations or articles.
(14) Glyphosate is a herbicide which can be produced in different grades or forms of concentration: formulated (with 36 % glyphosate content), salt (with 62 %), cake (with 84 %) and acid (with 95 %). In order to reduce the costs of transportation, distributors normally purchase glyphosate in a concentrated form (usually acid, but also salt) which they subsequently dilute to obtain the formulated glyphosate, the only form that can be used as an end product.
3. Movement of export prices from China and of resale prices in the community
(a) Introduction
(15) The purpose of this investigation is to establish whether measures have had the intended remedial effects in removing injury and whether any such failure to remove injury is as a result of increased dumping through a fall in export prices. For the purpose of the present proceeding, such a fall in export prices may be reflected in the direct export prices charged by exporters to the Community or it may be reflected in a lack of movement in resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community due to a compensatory arrangement. Therefore, the investigation examined price movements of export prices from China as well as prices at resale and other levels in the Community.
(b) Movement in export prices from China
(16) The Commission sought information on the export prices of glyphosate from China. Information was provided by the one cooperating Chinese exporter and four cooperating unrelated importers in the Community. In fact, export prices were found to have fallen by approximately 45 % as compared to those that were established during the original investigation.
(c) Movement in resale prices in the Community
(17) The Commission sought information on resale prices and subsequent selling prices of glyphosate in the Community before and after the imposition of anti-dumping measures. The four cooperating unrelated importers in the Community, who imported the product concerned during the investigation period, provided information on import and resale prices of Chinese glyphosate.
(18) A comparison of resale prices charged during the original investigation period and those charged during the present investigation period showed that resale prices had actually fallen since measures were imposed. On average this fall amounted to approximately 12 % as compared to the level previously established in the original investigation. The unrelated importers did not provide evidence that this fall was due to the increased efficiency of their resale operations in the Community.
4. Claims made by interested parties
(a) General
(19) In Article 12 investigations, importers and exporters are provided with an opportunity to provide evidence which could justify a lack of movement in prices in the Community following the imposition of measures. The reasons which can justify such a lack of movement include a reduction in the costs and profit of the importer or a fall in normal value. Several parties provided information in this respect.
(b) Producers/exporters in the country of origin
(20) One Chinese producer/exporter of glyphosate argued that the fall in resale prices since the imposition of anti-dumping measures was mainly caused by a worldwide decline in the cost of production of glyphosate, which in its turn was reflected in significant changes of normal values which ought to be taken into account.
(21) Since the normal value established during the original investigation was established on the basis of an analogue country, i.e. Brazil, the Commission requested information in respect of normal values from the two known Brazilian producers which cooperated during the original investigation, i.e. Monsanto Brasil and Nortox, which continue to be the sole producers of glyphosate in the analogue country. Investigations were carried out at the premises of the Brazilian producers.
(22) The Commission verified normal values and found that they had indeed fallen. This fall, which was calculated in relation to the normal values of the original case and those prevailing in the investigation period of this case, showed a fall of 17 %. However, as export prices had fallen by a far greater amount (45 %) the movement in normal values could not justify the lack of movement in resale prices in the Community.
(c) Unrelated importers in the Community
(23) The Commission also examined whether the lack of movement of resale prices was due to a decrease in the costs and profits of the unrelated importers. In this respect, the position of the four cooperating importers was examined and it was found that the levels of their costs and profits had remained broadly the same as those found in the original case. Therefore, these claims were rejected.
5. Reassessment of the export prices
(24) Normally, in Article 12 investigations where a lack of movement of resale prices has been established, export prices would be reassessed on the basis of prices charged to independent buyers in the Community by the importer from which all costs and a normal profit of the said importer would be deducted to arrive at a constructed export price. This would be done in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation.
(25) In this case, however, the reassessment of export prices was made by reference to the fall in the direct export prices charged between the exporters and importers in accordance with the last sentence of Article 12(2) of the basic Regulation. This direct fall in export prices was considered to be the reason for the lack of movement in resale prices and subsequent selling prices in the Community following the imposition of measures and therefore the absorption of measures is reflected in the fall in export prices.
(26) As export prices were found to have fallen by 45 % since the existing measures were imposed, the reassessed export prices were established by taking the export prices found in the original investigation and deducting the amount of the anti-dumping duty in force.
6. Recalculation of the dumping margin taking account of reassessed export prices
(27) As required under Article 12 of the basic Regulation, the Commission recalculated the dumping margin for the Chinese producers/exporters concerned. This was done by comparing the reassessed export prices with the normal values established during the original investigation. This gives a dumping margin which when expressed as a percentage of the cif value equates to 62 %. Pursuant to Article 12(3) of the basic Regulation, the measures in force shall therefore be amended in accordance with the new findings.
7. New level of duties
(28) The measures currently in force are based on the level of injury found in the original investigation. Therefore, the reassessed export prices were compared with the injury threshold established in the original investigation. Since the injury margin calculated on this basis is lower than the dumping margin, the new level of the duty should be based in the former.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) Fumaric acid was authorised in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive, without a time limit, for use on all animal species by Commission Directive 80/678/EEC (3). That additive was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of fumaric acid, as a feed additive for all animal species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘technological additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 29 January 2013 (4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, fumaric acid does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and it has the potential to preserve feed. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of fumaric acid shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of fumaric acid should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.

Whereas:
(1) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1878/2001 of 26 September 2001 laying down transitional measures in connection with the compensation system for storage costs for sugar(4), lays down that Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(6), will continue to apply to sugars carried forward from the 2000/01 marketing year to the 2001/02 marketing year.
(2) Article 1(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1713/93 provides that the amount of the reimbursement of storage costs referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 is to be converted into national currency using a specific agricultural conversion rate equal to the average, calculated pro rata temporis, of the agricultural conversion rates applicable during the month of storage.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 54 thereof,

Whereas the administrative procedures imposed on small and medium-sized undertakings should be simplified in accordance with the Council resolution of 3 November 1986 on the action programme for small and medium-sized undertakings (SMUs) (5) and the Council resolution of 30 June 1988 on the improvement of the business environment and action to promote the development of enterprises, especially small and medium-sized enterprises in the Community (6), which calls more especially for a substantial simplification of the obligations arising from Directive 78/660/EEC;
Whereas, on the basis of Article 53 (2) of Directive 78/660/EEC, it is appropriate that a second review of the thresholds defining small and medium-sized undertakings should be carried out;
Whereas the derogations as regards establishment, audit and publication of accounts which Member States may provide for under Directive 78/660/EEC should be increased as far as small companies are concerned;
Whereas Member States should be afforded the possibility of allowing companies not to include in the notes to the accounts certain information concerning remuneration granted to members of the company's administrative or management body where such information enables the position of a given member of such bodies to be identified;
Whereas it is also appropriate to enable Member States to render less stringent the obligations imposed on small companies as regards the drawing up and publication of the notes to the accounts; whereas Member States should be able to exempt such companies from the obligation to supply, in the notes to the accounts, certain data which may be deemed of less importance for small companies; whereas, with the same interests in view, Member States should have the possibility of exempting such companies from the obligation to draw up an annual report providing they include, in the notes to the accounts, the data referred to in Article 22 (2) of Directive 77/91/EEC (7) concerning the acquisition of own shares;
Whereas it is important to promote European monetary integration by allowing companies, at least, to publish their accounts in ecus; whereas this is simply an additional facility which does not change the position of companies which can at present already draw up and publish accounts in ecus; whereas, on this point, the provisions of Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC (1), as amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal should be clarified by obliging companies which have recourse to this facility to indicate the conversion rate used in the notes to the accounts,","{'title': 'Council Directive 90/604/EEC of 8 November 1990 amending Directive 78/660/EEC on annual accounts and Directive 83/349/EEC on consolidated accounts as concerns the exemptions for small and medium-sized companies and the publication of accounts in ecus', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '11', 'title': 'Article 11 of Directive 78/660/EEC is hereby amended as follows:', 'text': ""Article 11 of Directive 78/660/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products referred to in Part XIX of Annex I to that Regulation and prices in the Union for those products may be covered by an export refund.
(2) In view of the current situation on the market in eggs, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products which are authorised to move freely within the Union and comply with requirements under Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2) and of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3), as well as marking requirements under point A of Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 535/2012 (4). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.

Whereas the following indices, relating to the presence of land of limited potential referred to in Article 3 (4) (a) of Directive No 75/268/EEC have been utilized : 90 % of land devoted to forage production with a livestock density not greater than 1 719 livestock units per forage hectare and 0 795 livestock units per forage hectare if the heavy costs caused by the purchase of supplementary feeding are taken into account, wheat yield 31 q/ha (Community average 37 q/ha), unfavourable drainage conditions and uneven character of the area as shown by maps;
Whereas the economic results being considerably lower than the average, as referred to in Article 3 (4) (b) of Directive No 75/268/EEC, were calculated using indices relating to the net value added at factor cost per agricultural worker being less than 80 % of the Community average;
Whereas the index relating to the low population density referred to in Article 3 (4) (c) of Directive No 75/268/EEC which was utilized, has a value of 75 inhabitants per square kilometre, which represents 57 % of the national average but only 45 % of the Community average (168 inhabitants per square kilometre) ; whereas the minimum proportion of the working population engaged in agriculture as a percentage of the total working population is 15 710 %  (the national and Community averages are 9 727 and 9 758 % respectively);
Whereas for the delimitation of areas affected by specific handicaps, which can be considered as less-favoured areas within the meaning of Article 3 (5) of Directive No 75/268/EEC account was taken on the one hand, of the existence of unfavourable natural production conditions due to heavy clay and excessively wet soils (short period of time suitable for cultivation) and, on the other hand, of handicaps resulting from constraints due to numerous spare-time activities ; whereas, moreover, the total extent of these areas does not exceed 2 75 %  of the area of the Member State concerned;

terminating the anti-dumping proceeding on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’) and in particular Article 9(1) and Article 11(2), (5) and (6) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission (‘the Commission’) after having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   PROCEDURE
1.1.   Measures in force
(1) Following a review investigation carried out pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China currently falling within CN codes ex 2931 00 99 and ex 3808 93 27 (the ‘product concerned’). This duty had been extended to imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia (whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not) with the exception of those produced by Crop Protection (M) Sdn. Bhd. and to imports of glyphosate consigned from Taiwan (whether declared as originating in Taiwan or not) with the exception of those produced by Sinon Corporation. The rate of the anti-dumping duty is 29,9 %.
(2) By Decision 2009/383/EC (3), the Commission suspended the definitive anti-dumping duties for a period of 9 months, with effect from 16 May 2009. Subsequently, by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 126/2010 (4), the Council extended the suspension for a period of 1 year, with effect from 14 February 2010.
1.2.   Request for review
(3) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry (5) of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China, the Commission has received on 29 June 2009 a request for review pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.
(4) The request was lodged by the European Glyphosate Association (‘the applicant’) on behalf of producers representing the entire Union production of glyphosate.
(5) The request contained prima facie evidence showing that the expiry of the measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury to the Union industry.
1.3.   Initiation
(6) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, initiated, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (6), an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the European Union of glyphosate currently falling within CN codes ex 2931 00 99 and ex 3808 93 27 and originating in the People’s Republic of China.
(7) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers concerned, the representatives of the People’s Republic of China, the representative users and the Union producers of the initiation of the review investigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the notice of initiation.
2.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST
(8) By a letter dated 21 September 2010 to the Commission, the applicant formally withdrew its request.
(9) In accordance with Article 9(1) and Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation, a proceeding may be terminated where the request for review is withdrawn unless such a termination would not be in the Union interest.
(10) It was considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However, no comments were received which could alter this consideration.
(11) It was therefore concluded that the anti-dumping expiry review proceeding concerning imports into the Union of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China should be terminated and the existing measures should be repealed,","{'header': '16.12.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 332/31', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1187/2010\nof 13 December 2010\nterminating the anti-dumping proceeding on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe anti-dumping measures concerning imports of glyphosate currently falling within CN codes ex\xa02931\xa000\xa099 and ex\xa03808\xa093\xa027 and originating in the People’s Republic of China, are hereby repealed and the proceeding concerning these imports is terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 356/95(2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 24 October 2000 the Commission received a complaint pursuant to Article 3 and Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (hereafter the ""Regulation""). The complaint was lodged by the Committee of European Union Shipbuilders Associations (CESA).
(2) The complaint concerned certain alleged Korean trade practices which adversely affect Community sales of commercial vessels(3). In particular, the complaint contained information on adverse trade effects and injury suffered by Community shipbuilders resulting from subsidies granted to, or otherwise benefiting, Korean shipbuilding companies by the Republic of Korea in violation of Articles 3 and 5 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). On that basis, the complainant asked the Commission to take the necessary action.
(3) The complaint contained sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a Community examination procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation. Consequently, the Commission initiated the procedure after consulting with the Member States in the framework of the Advisory Committee, on 2 December 2000(4).
(4) Following the initiation of the examination procedure the Commission carried out an investigation, which has led to the conclusions indicated below.
B. FINDINGS REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBSTACLE TO TRADE
(5) The investigation was directed against subsidies allegedly granted by the Government of the Republic of Korea to its shipbuilding industry that benefited production between 1997 and 2000 and will benefit future production. Alleged Korean subsidies have included, export contingent financing, debt forgiveness, debt-for-equity-swaps, interest relief and special tax concessions in the context of preferential restructuring packages provided in order to save various shipbuilding enterprises from imminent financial collapse.
(6) The Korean shipbuilding enterprises claimed to have benefited from Korean Government subsidies included Samho Heavy Industries, Daedong Shipbuilding Co., Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering, Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Mipo, Samsung Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries &  Construction Co.
(7) With regard to the alleged Korean subsidies that were expressly the subject of the complaint the Commission established the following:
Advance payment (refund) guarantees and pre-shipment loans provided by the State-owned Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM)
(8) It was established that KEXIM provides a guarantee that a foreign buyer will be refunded any advance payments given to a Korean shipyard in case the Korean shipyard fails to perform its obligations under the relevant contract. It was also established that KEXIM provides pre-delivery loans to shipyards to finance shipbuilding production costs, such as raw material cost, labour and overheads until delivery of the ships. The APRG programme and the pre-shipment loans were found to constitute prohibited subsidies under Article 3(1)(a) of the SCM Agreement.
Debt forgiveness, debt-for-equity-swaps and interest relief by government-owned and government-controlled banks
(9) It was established that Korea has granted through debt forgiveness, debt-for-equity-swaps and interest relief by government-owned and government-controlled banks, subsidies within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement to the following shipyards:
- Samho Heavy Industries,
- Daedong Shipbuilding Co.(5) and
- Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering.
(10) There is prima facie evidence that these corporate restructuring subsidies are specific within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the SCM Agreement.
Special tax concessions
(11) It was established that Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering has benefited from two tax programmes under the Special Tax Treatment Control Law (special taxation on in-kind contribution and special taxation on spin-off) limited to companies under corporate restructuring which are therefore specific.
Conclusion
(12) The Commission considers that the complainant's allegation on the granting of subsidies is well-founded and that the Korean practices constitute an obstacle to trade within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation, as they are contrary to Articles 3 and 5 of the SCM Agreement.
C. FINDINGS REGARDING ADVERSE TRADE EFFECTS
(13) It was established that, during the investigation period, the Community industry suffered adverse effects within the meaning of Article 5 of the SCM Agreement and Article 2(3) and Article 2(4) of the Regulation, in the form of injury within the meaning of Article 5(a) of the SCM Agreement, namely, negative effects on market share, capacity utilisation, profit, sales prices, employment, investments, and of serious prejudice within the meaning of Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement, namely, significant price undercutting, price depression and lost sales. By sector, adverse effects were suffered in container ships and product and chemical tankers.
(14) In November 2001, CESA requested the Commission to examine whether adverse effects had been suffered by the Community industry during the period covering the 13 months following the end of the original investigation period (i.e. 1 December 2000 to 31 December 2001). The updating investigation confirmed the findings of the first investigation. As regards the liquified natural gas carriers (LNG) sector, it established that further examination is necessary to determine whether the developments observed in 2000 and 2001 would result in a consistent trend over a longer term. The Commission will continue to monitor the market, particularly as regards the sectors of container ships, product and chemical tankers and LNG carriers.
D. CAUSAL LINK
(15) It was established that the above subsidies, which rendered possible the increase in sales volume and market share of the Korean shipyards as well as the considerable decrease in their sales prices and the price undercutting found during the investigation period, caused adverse effects to the Community industry. These conclusions were confirmed by the updating investigation.
E. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(16) The shipbuilding industry in the Community represents a very important sector of economic activity in terms of employment, either direct, in the shipyards or indirect, in subcontracting or supplying companies. On the basis of the information available it seems reasonable to forecast that, should the Korean subsidy practices be halted, the Community industry may be able to regain at least part of its lost market shares and improve its profitability.
F. CONCLUSIONS
(17) Further to the above analysis, the Commission concludes that Korea has granted export and actionable subsidies within the meaning of the SCM Agreement to its shipbuilding industry and has caused adverse effects to the Community industry.
(18) Ensuring that WTO partners fully comply with their obligations is of the utmost importance for the Community, which has committed itself to the same obligations. It is fundamental for the good functioning of a multilateral trade system to consistently tackle allegedly WTO incompatible practices.
(19) The Commission discussed the matter with the Korean authorities with a view to finding a mutually agreed solution. However, as no mutually agreed solution could be found, the initiation of a procedure within the framework of the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding, and more particularly pursuant to the relevant provisions of the SCM Agreement, is required,",{'title': '2002/818/EC: Commission Decision of 8 October 2002 under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 concerning trade practices maintained by Korea affecting trade in commercial vessels (notified under document number C(2002) 3652)'}

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes diuron.
(3) For diuron the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. Moreover, those regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For diuron the rapporteur Member State was Denmark and all relevant information was submitted on 19 September 2003.
(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 January 2005 in the format of the EFSA Conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diuron (4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 24 November 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for diuron.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. The assessment of the data provided by the notifier indicated that even with protective equipment, operators would be exposed to quantities of the substance which exceed the Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL). It was not possible to reach a conclusion on the possible risk of groundwater contamination because of the lack of data on the degradation pattern of certain metabolites and the overly optimistic assumption made by the notifier that application rates may be considered significantly lower in practise. Similarly, based on the available data, it has not been demonstrated that the exposure for birds and mammals is acceptable.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments advanced, the above concerns remained unsolved, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing diuron satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Diuron should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing diuron are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing diuron allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '16.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 156/32', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 June 2007\nconcerning the non-inclusion of diuron in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document number C(2007) 2468)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/417/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 703/2001(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 39(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, areas used for the production of hemp are only eligible for direct payments if the varieties used have a tetrahydrocannabinol content not exceeding 0,2 %. Pursuant to Article 124(3) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, Article 39 of that Regulation also applies to areas under the single area payment scheme in the new Member States.
(2) Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1120/2009 of 29 October 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the single payment scheme provided for in Title III of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (2) lays down that the payment of entitlements for areas planted with hemp shall be subject to the use of seed of the varieties listed in the ‘Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species’, with the exception of the varieties Finola and Tiborszállási, which are at present only eligible in Finland and Hungary respectively.
(3) Based on notifications of some Member States and given the fact that a procedure is already foreseen for the exclusion of a given variety at the level of the Member States, the scheme can be simplified at Union level by deleting the provision which limits the eligibility of areas using the varieties Finola and Tiborszállási to a certain Member State.
(4) Article 40 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system, under the direct support schemes for farmers provided for that Regulation, as well as for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards cross-compliance under the support scheme provided for the wine sector (3) sets the procedure to be followed when the samples of a given variety exceed the tetrahydrocannabinol content laid down in Article 39(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(5) Taking into account that Member States have all the information at hand to request from the Commission the authorisation to prohibit the marketing of a hemp variety having a tetrahydrocannabinol content exceeding that laid down in Article 39(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 and to exclude such variety from eligibility to direct payments, the scheme can be simplified further by deleting the obligation to notify the reports on the tetrahydrocannabinol findings relating to samples of that variety.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 3 March 2014
on setting up a Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Chemical Agents and repealing Decision 95/320/EC
(2014/113/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Whereas:
(1) The Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Chemical Agents (hereinafter the Committee) was set up by Commission Decision 95/320/EC (1) to evaluate the health effects of chemical agents on workers at work. The work of the Committee directly supports Union regulatory activity in the field of occupational safety and health. It develops high quality comparative analytical knowledge and it ensures that Commission proposals, decisions and policy relating to the protection of workers’ health and safety are based on sound scientific evidence.
(2) The Committee assists the Commission, in particular, in evaluating the latest available scientific data and in proposing occupational exposure limits (OELs) for the protection of workers from chemical risks, to be set at Union level pursuant to Council Directive 98/24/EC (2) and Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).
(3) Members of SCOEL are highly qualified, specialized, independent experts selected on the basis of objective criteria. They are appointed in their personal capacity and provide the Commission with Recommendations and Opinions that are necessary for the development of EU policy on workers protection. The nature of the contribution is such that without it the Commission could not reach its social policy objectives to protect workers’ health and safety. Therefore, these independent experts should receive remuneration beyond reimbursement of expenses, which is proportionate to the particular tasks attributed to them.
(4) The work of the Committee makes an effective contribution to improving the working environment to protect workers’ health and safety by providing the Commission with scientific evidence on the health effects of chemical agents on workers at work which is indispensable in order that the Commission is able to attain the relevant Union social policy objectives. Therefore, the financing of its activities will be provided by the relevant budget line that is dedicated to supporting initiatives in the social policies and working conditions field.
(5) There is also a need to introduce improvements to the structure and working procedures of the Committee.
(6) The Committee members should be selected through a call for expression of interest. This will ensure that the procedure respects the principles of equal opportunities and transparency.
(7) With a view to ensuring continuity and efficiency of the Committee’s work, the members appointed by Commission Decision 2009/985/EU (4) should remain in office until new members of the Committee are appointed.
(8) Scientific advice that is given on matters relating to the protection of workers’ health and safety must be based on the ethical principles of excellence, independence, impartiality and transparency, as developed in the Commission Communication on ‘The collection and use of expertise by the Commission: principles and guidelines. Improving knowledge for better policies’ (5), and it must be organised in accordance with best practice principles of risk assessment.
(9) Since substantive amendments are to be made to Decision 95/320/EC, that Decision should be repealed and replaced by a new Decision in the interest of clarity,","{'header': '4.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 62/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 3 March 2014\non setting up a Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Chemical Agents and repealing Decision 95/320/EC\n(2014/113/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limits for Chemical Agents (hereinafter the Committee) was set up by Commission Decision 95/320/EC(1)to evaluate the health effects of chemical agents on workers at work.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular Article 46(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Point A(3) of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide levels of wine may be increased where climatic conditions have made this necessary.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 (2) lays down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine in particular. Under Article 19(4) thereof, Annex XIIa to that Regulation lists the cases where the Member States may authorise an increase in the maximum total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre because of weather conditions.
(3) By letter of 1 March 2007, the French Government requested authorisation to increase the maximum permissible total sulphur dioxide content of wine of less than 300 milligrams per litre by a maximum of 40 milligrams per litre for wine produced in the Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin regions from the 2006 grape harvest in the wake of exceptionally unfavourable weather conditions. That request should be acceded to.
(4) The technical note provided by the competent French authorities shows that the quantities of sulphur dioxide needed to ensure the proper vinification and proper preservation of the wines affected by these unfavourable conditions and to ensure that they are suitable for placing on the market should be increased above the level normally authorised. This temporary measure is the only available option to allow the grapes affected by these unfavourable weather conditions to be used to produce wine suitable for placing on the market. Following measures taken by the French Institute of Winemaking Technology, it has been estimated that approximately 25 % of the total quantity produced in this area is likely to be affected by this derogation.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 19 January 2010
on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands
(2010/287/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, Article 126(6) in conjunction with Article 126(13) and Article 136 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by the Netherlands,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 also establishes provisions for the implementation of Article 104 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, required the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considered that an excessive deficit in a Member State existed or might occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4) thereof, which has become Article 126(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit existed in the Netherlands. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of the Netherlands on 11 November 2009 (3).
(6) Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of the Netherlands, this overall assessment leads to the conclusions set out in this Decision.
(7) According to data notified by the Dutch authorities in October 2009, the general government deficit in the Netherlands is planned to reach 4,8 % of GDP in 2009, thus above and not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value. The planned excess over the reference value can be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. It results mainly from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In the Commission services’ 2009 autumn forecast GDP is expected to contract by 4,5 % in 2009 and to grow by only ¼ % in 2010. Furthermore, also on the basis of the Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the general government deficit is projected to increase from 4,7 % of GDP in 2009 to 6,1 % of GDP in 2010 before it declines slightly to 5,6 % of GDP in 2011 based on the usual no-policy change assumption. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) According to data notified by the Dutch authorities in October 2009, the general government gross debt is below the 60 % of GDP reference value, at 59,7 % (4) of GDP in 2009. The Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast expects the general government gross debt to come out at 59,8 % of GDP in 2009 and to increase to around 66 % of GDP in 2010 and 70 % of GDP in 2011, thus exceeding the 60 % of GDP reference value. This increase stems in large part from an important expected deterioration of the primary balance.
(9) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of the Netherlands, this double condition is not met.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n\n((5)) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.\n\n((6)) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n\n((7)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice-cream and other foodstuffs(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 29 April 2005.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 29 April 2005 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n1\n)\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\nex\xa00402\xa010\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\xa0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a)\non exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n—\n—\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n26,53\n28,00\nex\xa00402\xa021\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\xa0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a)\nwhere goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 are exported\n32,54\n34,67\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n61,57\n65,60\nex\xa00405\xa010\nButter, with a fat content by weight of 82\xa0% (PG 6):\n(a)\nwhere goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 are exported\n40,70\n44,00\n(b)\non exportation of goods of CN code 2106\xa090\xa098  containing 40\xa0% or more by weight of milk fat\n126,58\n136,25\n(c)\non exportation of other goods\n119,33\n129,00\n(\n1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to Bulgaria, with effect from 1 October 2004, and to the goods listed in Tables I and II to Protocol No 2 the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation or to the Principality of Liechtenstein with effect from 1 February 2005.'}]}"

Whereas Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides for the possibility of a transitional period of preliminary recognition to enable new producer organizations or those which have not been recognized under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1363/95 (3), to meet the conditions for recognition laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96; whereas, as a result, certain conditions should be laid down for the grant of preliminary recognition to producer organizations which submit a recognition plan;
Whereas, to promote the setting-up of stable producer organizations capable of making a lasting contribution to the attainment of the objectives of the common market organization, preliminary recognition should be granted only to producer organizations which can demonstrate their ability to meet all the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 within a specified time-limit;
Whereas, to enable producer organizations to bring themselves gradually into line with the conditions laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 412/97 (4) as regards the recognition of producer organizations, less strict conditions should be laid down for the grant of preliminary recognition; whereas Member States should also be allowed to lay down stricter limits than those laid down in this Regulation, without exceeding those laid down in Article 11 (1) (c) (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and in Regulation (EC) No 412/97, in order to take account of the different production and marketing conditions in the various Member States;
Whereas, to enable recognized producer organizations to be restructured, the obligation laid down in Article 11 (1) (c) (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 should not apply until a producer organization granted preliminary recognition obtains full recognition, without prejudice to the Member States laying down stricter conditions;
Whereas, to enable producer organizations to submit a recognition plan in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the information which producer organizations must provide in the plan should be laid down;
Whereas, to enable producer organizations better to meet the recognition conditions, there is a need to authorize changes to recognition plans; whereas to that end, provision should be made for each Member State to be able to request the producer organization to take corrective action to ensure that the plan is implemented;
Whereas producer organizations may meet the conditions laid down in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 and in Regulation (EC) No 412/97 before the recognition plan is completed; whereas provision should be made to allow such organizations to submit applications for recognition under those Regulations; whereas, for the sake of consistency, the grant of such recognition to a producer organization must signify the termination of its recognition plan;
Whereas, to give producer organizations granted preliminary recognition the opportunity to implement an operational programme in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/97 (5) as soon as recognition has been granted, it should be possible for such organizations to submit a draft operational programme when they submit their application for recognition;

","COMMISSION DECISION of 30 January 1997 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Spain of certain Portland cement originating in Romania, Tunisia and Turkey (97/169/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (2), hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`, and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In January 1992, the Commission received a complaint lodged by Oficemen, the national organization of Spanish cement producers acting on behalf of all Spanish producers of Portland cement.
(2) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of dumping on a regional basis and of injury resulting therefrom. The evidence presented was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding in order to establish whether the facts alleged existed and justified any action being taken. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Spain of certain Portland cement originating in Turkey, Romania and Tunisia, and began an investigation. The product concerned is Portland cement, other than white, whether or not artificially coloured, in bulk or in bags, falling within CN code 2523 29 00.
(3) The Commission officially advised the producers, exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries, and the complainants, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(4) The Governments of Turkey and Tunisia, and the producers and exporters in the countries concerned made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested were granted a hearing.
(5) The investigation period was set as 1 April 1991 to 31 March 1992.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of its determination of dumping and injury and carried out investigations at the premises of the following Spanish producers:
- Asland Cataluna y del Mediterranneo, Barcelona,
- Asland, SA, Madrid,
- Cementos Atlantico, SA, Madrid,
- Cementos Molins, SA, Barcelona,
- Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland, SA, Valencia,
- Portland Iberia, SA, Madrid,
- Sociedad Financiera y Minera, SA, Madrid,
- Uniland Cementera, SA, Barcelona.
(7) On the basis of the results of such investigation, the Commission, after consulting the Anti-dumping Committee, concluded that the proceeding should be terminated without measures because no material injury nor threat thereof was found to have been caused to the Spanish industry by the imports concerned.
(8) The Commission, given the objections within the Advisory Committee, submitted, on 10 February 1994, in accordance with Article 9 of the Basic Regulation, a report to the Council together with a proposal that the proceeding be terminated without measures.
The Council, on 7 March 1994, decided not to terminate the proceeding.
(9) The Commission, following the Council's decision, re-examined the results of its investigation in the light of both information provided by the Spanish industry and verified during the investigation, and further representations from the complainants. In this respect, the scope of this re-examination was limited by the fact that it could only look at data from the investigation period and the information relating to a subsequent period can therefore not be taken into account.
(10) This re-examination led the Commission to maintain the proposal made to the Council in 1994.
B. LIKE PRODUCT
(11) The investigation showed that the various types of Portland cement sold on the domestic markets of the countries concerned were alike to those exported to Spain. Similarly, the various types of Portland cement manufactured in Spain and those exported to Spain from the three countries in question were alike in their essential physical characteristics and end uses. Therefore, the Commission concluded that, for the purposes of this proceeding, all types of Portland cement should be considered as a like product, in accordance with Article 2 (12) of the Basic Regulation.
C. REGIONALITY
(12) The Commission established that 94 % of total production of the product in question by the Spanish industry was sold on the Spanish market and that total demand in Spain, as defined by apparent consumption of the cement concerned, was not to any substantial degree supplied by producers elsewhere in the Community. The share of their domestic market held by sales of the Spanish industry in the investigation period was close to 89 %, while imports from other Community Member States represented 2 %. Furthermore, 89 % of total Community imports from the countries subject to this proceeding were imported into Spain.
The Spanish industry could, therefore, be considered as constituting the Community industry within the terms of Article 4 (5) of the Basic Regulation.
D. DUMPING
(13) From the data available, there were indications that the like product imported from the three countries in question had been sold on the Spanish market at prices which, in some instances, represented a substantial element of dumping. This aspect was not pursued, however, given the findings on injury below.
E. INJURY
1. Consumption, volume and market share of imports from the countries concerned.
(14) The Spanish market, as defined by apparent consumption went from 26 million tonnes in 1989 to 28 million in the investigation period. Imports from the countries concerned grew from 857 000 tonnes in 1989 to 2 388 000 in the investigation period. As a result of this, the market share taken by Turkey, Romania and Tunisia went from 3,28 % in 1989 to 8,54 % in the investigation period.
2. Impact of the imports concerned on the Spanish industry.
(15) With regard to the possible impact of the imports concerned on the situation of the Spanish industry, the Commission took account of the following facts:
(a) Spanish production was stable at around 27 million tonnes annually over the period examined.
(b) Capacity installed stood at an estimated 39 million tonnes in 1989, 1990 and 1991, and grew by around 5 % to 41 million tonnes in the investigation period. Capacity utilization was stable at 69 % between 1989 and 1991, but fell to 66 % in the investigation period. This fall in the capacity utilization rate was due only to the increase in capacity installed. In this context, the Commission notes that, relative to total demand in Spain, a large over-capacity, averaging 32 %, existed in the Spanish industry throughout the period examined.
(c) Total sales volumes of the Spanish industry remained stable at around 25 million tonnes throughout the period in question. Given the moderate rise in consumption, the market share of the industry, however, fell from 96 % in 1989 to 89 % in the investigation period. Despite this fall, the market share of the Spanish industry remained consistently high.
(d) The selling prices to unrelated customers of the Spanish producers investigated, on an index basis, rose from 100 in 1989 to 103 in 1990, and then fell to 97 in 1991 and 94 in the investigation period.
(e) The companies investigated saw profitability on sales to unrelated clients decline, on average, from 36 % in 1989, to 32 % in 1990, 21 % in 1991, and to 18 % in the investigation period.
(f) Employment by the producers investigated fell continuously over the period as a whole, moving, on an index basis from 100 in 1989, to 98 in 1990, 94 in 1991, and 92 in the investigation period.
(g) The Commission looked also into the possible injury caused by the imports concerned on a subregional basis, taking into account the different geographical locations of the Spanish producers. The Commission's examination of injury factors showed that only the situation of the producers based on the Mediterranean coastal zone, which represents 52 % of the total complainant industry's output, clearly deteriorated in contrast to that of producers located further inland. In fact, in terms of sales volume, between 1989 and the investigation period, coastal volumes fell by 10 % while inland increased by 3 %, and, in terms of turnover, coastal figure fell by 9 % while inland increased slightly by 1 %. Finally, with regard to the coastal industry, its profitability fell since 1989 by 4 percentage points more than for the inland industry. Despite this decrease, the profitability for the coastal industry remained at a level of 18 % during the investigation period.
F. CONCLUSIONS ON INJURY
(16) Although the situation of the Spanish industry deteriorated to some extent over the period considered, notably with regard to producers located on the Mediterranean coastal zone, such situation has to be assessed in relation to the Spanish producers generally, in order to determine whether these developments constitute material injury. In doing so, the Commission paid particular attention to the following factors:
(a) Production and sales volumes were stable. Although the increase in consumption appeared to have benefited dumped imports and not domestic production, the Spanish industry nevertheless still retained a market share of 89 %.
(b) The Commission's examination of price undercutting showed that, although undercutting did exist, its effects could not be considered significant, in the light of, on the one hand, the respective market shares held by domestic producers and by imports from the three countries concerned and, on the other hand, the impact of these imports, which was limited geographically to the coastal industry.
(c) The large overcapacity and the consequent restructuring of the domestic industry played an important role in explaining the increase in costs of production and, therefore, the fall in profits. In this regard, Spanish producers did experience a reduction in their return on sales, which was however, still 18 % on average during the investigation period for the whole industry.
Alternative profit indicators, such as return on investment, as suggested by the Spanish industry, have been examined. On the basis of the data provided by the complainant and verified to a satisfactory extent in the course of the investigation, it was found that, after taking into account inflationary cost pressures and eliminating the excess of capacity, the return on investment ratio established for the investigation period amounted to 7 % and was thus considered adequate for the replacement of productive assets by the industry.
(d) Employment in the complainant industry fell by 8 % between 1989 and the investigation period. However, this fall was due, to a great extent, to the restructuring of the production process.
On the basis of the above factors, it cannot be concluded that the Spanish industry has suffered material injury. This conclusion can be explained by the fact that the present proceeding refers to a regional market, as pointed out in recital (11) above. In such cases, Article 4 (5) of the Basic Regulation requires that injury is caused to the producers of all or almost all of the production within the regional market concerned. In the present proceeding, however, the Commission's examination of the individual producers investigated, on both inland and coastal areas, did not lead to the conclusion that this requirement was met.
G. THREAT OF INJURY
(17) The Commission considers that, although the complainant also alleged that a threat of material injury existed, no substantial evidence of such threat was presented by the complainant when the complaint was submitted, nor found in the course of the investigation.
H. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(18) In the absence of injury or threat thereof to the producers of all or almost all of the production within the regional market under consideration, a determination of material injury with regard to the Community industry concerned by the present proceeding cannot be made.
In these circumstances, it is concluded that the introduction of protective measures appears to be unnecessary and the anti-dumping proceeding should be terminated,","{'title': 'Commission Decision of 30 January 1997 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into Spain of certain Portland cement originating in Romania, Tunisia and Turkey'}"

(2013/728/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4), in conjunction with Article 218(9), thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) A moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions (‘e-commerce moratorium’) to the effect that WTO members are to continue their current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions was adopted in the form of a declaration at the 1998 Ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
(2) Currently the moratorium takes the form of a WTO Ministerial Conference decision, which has been renewed every two years since 1998. The moratorium was last extended at the WTO Ministerial Conference in December 2011 till 2013.
(3) No consensus on banning or allowing non-violation or situation complaints under the TRIPS Agreement has been possible up to now. The Declaration adopted at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in 2005 states: ‘We take note of the work done by the Council for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights pursuant to paragraph 11.1 of the Doha Decision on Implementation-Related Issues and Concerns and paragraph 1.h of the Decision adopted by the General Council on 1 August 2004, and direct it to continue its examination of the scope and modalities for complaints of the types provided for under subparagraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Article XXIII of GATT 1994 and make recommendations to our next Session.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (2), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the necessary measures governing access to areas and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries.
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, the Council establishes the fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of those opportunities to Member States.
(3) In order to ensure effective management of the fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.
(4) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities.
(5) In accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures provided for therein must be identified.
(6) In order to contribute to the conservation of fish stocks, certain supplementary measures relating to the technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2009.
(7) The reduction in the total allowable catch (TAC) for sprat should not affect its future stock levels, which should take into account the fishing activities of other Black Sea coastal States.
(8) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with Community legislation on the subject, in particular with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (3) and Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (4).
(9) Bearing in mind that in one Member State, before the entry into force of this Regulation, nets with a mesh size inferior to 400 mm were traditionally used to catch turbot, and in order to allow adequate adaptation to the technical measures introduced in this Regulation, vessels flying the flag of that Member State shall be permitted to fish for turbot using nets with a minimum mesh size of no less than 360 mm.
(10) In order to ensure proper enforcement and control, the mesh size should be measured in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 517/2008 of 10 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 as regards the determination of the mesh size and assessing the thickness of twine of fishing nets (5).

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,

(1) Cabbages are among the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for which standards are to be adopted. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1591/87 of 5 June 1987 laying down quality standards for cabbages, Brussels sprouts, ribbed celery and spinach (2) has been amended several times. For reasons of clarity, the rules on headed cabbages should be separated from those on other products under Regulation (EEC) No 1591/87 and laid down in a separate Regulation.
(2) To that end, and in the interest of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the UN/ECE standard FFV-09 concerning marketing and quality control of headed cabbages recommended by the Working party on agricultural quality standards of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).
(3) Packages containing a mixture of types of headed cabbage are becoming more common on the market. Therefore the provision concerning marking of these packages need to be clarified.
(4) Application of the new standard should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve profitability.
(5) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause some degree of deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch.

The minimum size is 350 grams per unit.\nThe weight of the heaviest head in any one package must not be more than double the weight of the lightest head. When the weight of the heaviest head is equal to or less than 2 kilograms the difference between the heaviest and the lightest head may be up to 1 kilogram.\nThe size requirements shall not apply to miniature produce.\n‘Miniature produce’ means a variety or cultivar of cabbages, obtained by plant breeding and/or special cultivation techniques, excluding cabbages of non-miniature varieties which have not fully developed or are of inadequate size. All other requirements of the standard shall apply.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERENCES\nTolerances in respect of quality and size are allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements for the class indicated.\nA.\xa0\xa0\xa0Quality tolerances\n(i)\xa0\xa0\xa0Class I\n10\xa0% by number or weight of headed cabbages not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting the requirements for Class II or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n(ii)\xa0\xa0\xa0Class II\n10\xa0% by number or weight of headed cabbages not satisfying the requirements of the class, or the minimum requirements, but excluding headed cabbages visibly affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering them unfit for consumption.\nB.\xa0\xa0\xa0Size tolerances\nFor all classes: 10\xa0% by number or weight of headed cabbages not meeting the specified requirements.\nHowever, no head may weigh less than 300 grams.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0PROVISIONS CONCERNING PRESENTATION\nA.\xa0\xa0\xa0Uniformity\nThe contents of each package, must contain only headed cabbages of the same origin, variety and quality.\nIn Class I, the headed cabbages must be uniform in shape and colour.\nMiniature produce must be reasonably uniform in size.\nHowever, a mixture of the various types of headed cabbages described in this standard may be packed together, provided they are uniform in quality and, for each type concerned, in variety, size and origin.\nThe visible part of the contents of the package must be representative of the entire contents.\nNotwithstanding the first to fifth paragraphs, products covered by this standard may be mixed, in sales packages of a net weight of three kilograms or less, with different types of fresh fruit and vegetables on the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 48/2003\n(\n1\n)\n.\nB.\xa0\xa0\xa0Packaging\nThe headed cabbages must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\nThe materials used inside the package must be clean and of a quality such as to avoid causing any external or internal damage to the produce.

(2) In view of the current situation on the market in eggs, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products which are authorised to move freely within the Union and comply with requirements under Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2) and of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3), as well as marking requirements under point A of Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 858/2012 (4). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.

Whereas Regulation (EC) No 728/97 established the portion of each of the quotas concerned reserved for traditional and other importers and the conditions and methods for participating in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas importers lodged applications for import licences with the competent national authorities between 26 April and 3 p. m., Brussels time, on 24 May 1997, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 728/97;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2001(4); the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(7), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) Under Annex V, point B.IV, paragraph 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the grading of pig carcases is to be determined by estimating the lean meat content by means of statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase. The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance is defined in Article 23(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcases and the reporting of prices thereof (2).

(3) Examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising these grading methods are fulfilled.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the German Government has submitted to the Commission on 22 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the areas of  the Land Bayern concerned by Objective 2; whereas this document contains the elements referred to  in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88; whereas expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article  33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas certain measures planned under this Single Programming Document include the part-financing  of aid schemes which have not yet been approved by the Commission; whereas the financial  commitments should be reduced by the amounts corresponding to the said measures until the aid  schemes are approved by the Commission;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a  single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole  programmation period;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been  complied with,","{'title': '94/1054/EC: Commission Decision of 16 December 1994 on the approval of the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the areas of the Land Bayern concerned by Objective 2 in Germany (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance  in the areas of the Land Bayern concerned by Objective 2 in Germany, covering the period 1 January  1994 to 31 December 1996, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Single Programming Document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an  appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional  policies in Germany;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. industrial-related infrastructures;\n\n2. development of indigeneous potential;\n\n3. infrastructure in environmental protection;\n\n4. vocational training;\n\n5. orientation and advice;\n\n6. support of employment and start-ups;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the Single Programming Document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the financial implementation provisions,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality and an initial evaluation of the latter;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the  Single Programming Document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or  adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nFor the purpose of indexation, the annual breakdown of the global maximal allocation  foreseen for the assistance from the Structural Funds is as follows:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the Single  Programming Document amounts to a maximum of ECU 14,660 million.\n\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the  Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed  implementing provisions which form an integral part of the Single Programming Document.\n\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 18,1 million for the  public sector and ECU 0,8 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans, in  particular from the ECSC and EIB.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Article 85 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962 (1), and in particular Article 14 (3) thereof,
Having consulted the competent authority of the relevant Member State for the purpose of Article 14 (4) of Regulation No 17,
Whereas:
There is sufficient reason to believe that producers of zinc metal and zinc concentrates within and outside the common market jointly fix prices and sales conditions for zinc by agreeing on a ""producer price"" for GOB zinc (good ordinary brand), control production and share markets, and that these activities constitute agreements or concerted practices as prohibited under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty.
On 10 February 1978, the Member of the Commission responsible for competition policy ordered investigations to be made of various undertakings pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation No 17.
The Commission has, during previous investigations, obtained precise and corroborated evidence which shows inter alia that the largest European, Canadian and Australian producers of zinc and zinc concentrates decided in 1964 to introduce a producer price which was independent of the quotations on the London Metal Exchange, and to influence prices on the London Metal Exchange by buying or selling through a subsidiary set up for this purpose and based in Switzerland.
Subsequently, the producers have held regular meetings - more than 20 since 9 July 1964 - and have again fixed prices. Changes in price were on each occasion announced by one of the producers and were then followed by the other participants. The new price was soon afterwards published in the ""Metal Bulletin"", a London trade journal.
AM & S Europe Ltd, a member of the Rio Tinto-Zinc Group, is suspected of having participated in these practices concerning prices and sales conditions, control of production and market sharing for several years.
On 20 and 21 February 1979 an investigation pursuant to Article 14 (2) of Regulation No 17 took place at the premises of AM & S Europe Ltd. The undertaking, represented by its managing director and two external lawyers, in the first instance submitted to the investigation. It then tried to produce only business records referring to the current situation but without defining what period of time was thereby meant.
The Commission officials responsible for the investigation refused to accept any such restriction of their investigative power, and were then able to inspect certain of the business records required by them.
On the second day of the investigation the undertaking again demanded a limit to the inspection of current papers and further investigation became impracticable. The Commission officials made a formal written request to make available certain business papers. The undertaking said that it would respond within 10 days of the return of its managing director from a business visit to Australia.
By letter of 26 March 1979 AM & S Europe Ltd sent photocopies of a number of business records and informed the Commission as follows. Copies of those documents selected as responding to the written request had been delivered to its legal advisers. The letter had indicated that certain documents were covered by legal privilege and for this reason these documents had not been produced.
The lawyers had also indicated that certain passages including individual words, phrases and even individual letters of other documents were of no relevance to the Commission's investigation and these passages had therefore been deleted, although the other parts of the documents in question were admitted to be relevant to the subject of the inquiry.  (1)OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62.
They further stated that they would shortly furnish the Commission with a statutory declaration describing the deleted passages in general terms. By letter of 5 April 1979 a statutory declaration of Mr G. D. Child, solicitor, was sent to the Commission. This indicated the nature and number of the deletions made but did not describe their contents.
This attempt by AM & S Europe Ltd to restrict the investigative power of the Commission is not justified by the provisions of Regulation No 17.
Community competition legislation does not provide for any protection for legal papers. However, as the Commission made clear in its reply to Written Question No 63/78 in the European Parliament, asked by Mr Cousté, the Commission ""follows the rules in the competition law of certain Member States and is willing not to use as evidence of infringements of Community competition rules any strictly legal papers written with a view to seeking or giving opinions on points of law to be observed or relating to the preparation or planning of the defence of the firm or association of firms concerned. When the Commission comes across such papers it does not copy them"" (1).
Clearly neither the undertaking concerned nor its legal advisers can be the ultimate or only arbiter, either as to questions of fact or of law, as to whether any given document is one of these kinds of documents and was written in circumstances which would justify its not being used.
Under existing Community law, and subject to review by the Court of Justice, it is for the Commission to determine whether a given document should be used or not. Therefore it is necessary for AM & S Europe Ltd to allow the Commission's inspector to look at the documents, and to ask questions in connection with them, as far as is necessary for the purpose of establishing whether they should be used or not. If the inspector considers that they should not be used, he will not take any copies and the documents will not be used subsequently by the Commission as evidence of any infringement.
AM & S Europe Ltd claims the right to delete, even from documents which are admitted to be relevant to the investigation, certain passages and words as being of no relevance. This claim is also contrary to Article 14 of Regulation No 17.
Subject to the review of the Court of Justice, it is for the Commission to decide which papers are to be inspected as relevant to the investigation. Otherwise it would no longer be the Commission but the undertaking itself which would determine the nature and scope of an investigation. Thus inspection in their entirety of all the documents connected with the subject of the inquiry, with no deletions, is necessary for the satisfactory accomplishment of an investigation under Article 14 of Regulation No 17.
AM & S Europe Ltd must therefore be required by Decision to submit to an investigation and in particular to permit the inspection and examination of the business records connected with the subject of the inquiry.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular to Articles 92 and 93 thereof,
Having given the other Member States and interested parties, pursuant to Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty, a period in which to submit their comments,
Having regard to the comments submitted,
Whereas:
I
By decision dated 11 November 1992 (1), the Commission authorized an 8 % investment premium for investment projects in the new Länder begun before 1 July 1994 and completed before the end of 1996. The aid intensity of 8 % gross (approximately 5,2 % net) relates exclusively to the cost of acquiring assets for fixed investment.
The investment premium is granted direct by Federal law, so that every undertaking which fulfils the statutory requirements can claim the premium without the authorities having to take a discretionary decision. The premium consists of a reduction of corporation tax and can result in a negative tax claim by the State, so that instead of a tax reduction the recipient undertaking receives a sum of money.
Article 3 of the Investment Premium Law 1993 (InvZulG) was amended by Article 18(1) of the Finance Law 1996 (2) to the effect that the 8 % premium is now granted to investments which were begun after 31 December 1992 but before 1 July 1994 and which will be concluded before 1 January 1999. This extended the time-limit for the implementation of assisted investment projects by two years, but did not change the provisions governing the start of the investment. The Finance Law 1996 came into force on 1 January 1996. By letter dated 17 November 1995, the Federal Ministry of Finance informed the Länder tax authorities that the said provision must not be applied before the Commission has approved the aid pursuant to Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. The letter was published in the Federal Tax Gazette (Bundessteuerblatt) 1996, Series I, No 1.
II
The Commission was informed of the amendment to the Investment Premium Law in a communication dated 19 December 1995, i.e. six working days before the entry into force of the Finance Law 1996; the amendment was therefore registered as a non-notified aid (NN 6/96).
On 3 July 1996 the Commission decided, because the period in which the 8 % investment premium may be claimed was being extended, to initiate the procedure under Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty. Its reason for so doing was that the extension constituted additional State aid for investment projects which were begun before 1 July 1994 and which will be completed in 1997 and 1998, since no extra investment compared with the original situation was being promoted. The measure would therefore not assist any new investment projects which could contribute to the regional economic development of the former GDR.
Consequently, the aid would only boost the equity of the undertakings which before July 1994 had begun to invest in the new Länder; it would accordingly have to be regarded as operating aid, which, as the Commission has consistently held, is compatible with the common market only if certain conditions are met and the aid serves exclusively to assist the economic development of areas in accordance with Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. The Commission took the view, however, that the aid could also stimulate economic development outside these assisted areas, with the result that the question was whether the aid could exceptionally be declared compatible with the common market.
Germany was informed by letter dated 31 July 1996 (3) of the initiation of the procedure and, like the other Member States and interested parties, was invited by publication of that letter in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4) to submit its comments.
Germany submitted its comments by letter dated 9 September 1996, and the French undertaking Elf Aquitaine SA (Elf) by letter dated 29 October 1996. On 30 October 1996, the French Government gave its views making reference to Elf's submission. It is clear from Elf's comments that the measure in question relates to investment by the Elf subsidiary Mitteldeutsche Erdöl-Raffinerie (MIDER), which is building a new refinery at Leuna in Saxony-Anhalt. As a result of unforeseen technical difficulties, which the undertaking says it is not responsible for, the investment has been delayed. Without the proposed extension of the time-limit, the investment premium for the entire project could not be claimed, which would put MIDER at a considerable economic disadvantage.
The letters from Elf and the French Government were forwarded for comment to the Federal Republic of Germany by letter dated 26 November 1996.
Between December 1996 and July 1997 the matter was discussed at several meetings between the German authorities and the Commission's departments.
III
In Germany's view, the extension of the time-limit for investment projects for which the 8 % investment premium can be claimed is compatible with the common market. The extension will avert a reduction of investment aid for large projects where delays have occurred on account of the particular circumstances in eastern Germany. In this way, the equity of undertakings investing in the new Länder will be increased, thus contributing to their economic stability. According to Germany, it is not known how many cases are affected by the general extension of the time-limit for claiming the investment premium. Basically, the extension applies to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been completed by the end of 1996.
In the MIDER/Leuna 2000 case, which the competent authorities had in mind when they proposed the said provision, the undertaking could not conclude the investment project in time by the end of 1996 on account of unforeseeable technical and administrative problems for which the undertaking could not be held responsible. The total aid package for the Leuna 2000 refinery would have been some DEM 360 million lower than had been accepted when the privatisation agreement was concluded. For legal reasons, it was not possible to pass a Federal law just for the MIDER case. The Federal Government, however, declared its readiness to apply the Investment Premium Law as amended by the Finance Law 1996 to MIDER only and to notify individually any further cases to which the amendment would apply.
IV
The investment premium is State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 61(1) of the EEA Agreement.
The extension of the time-limit for investment projects in respect of which an 8 % premium can be requested from 2 >NUM>1/
>DEN>2
to 4 years to 4 >NUM>1/
>DEN>2
to 6 years constitutes additional State aid.
How many investment projects might be covered by the general extension of the time-limit is not known. Basically, the new time-limits apply to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been concluded by the end of 1996.
Undertakings which began investment projects between January 1993 and June 1994 took their decision in the full knowledge that projects which were not completed by the end of 1996 either would not qualify at all for the investment premium, since the finished part would not be regarded as a complete but smaller than planned investment, or, if the part completed in time is treated as a full investment, albeit smaller than planned, would qualify only to a certain extent. The particular problems which prevent the swift implementation of complex investment projects on the territory of the former GDR, such as organisational difficulties of regional and local authorities, possible environmental burdens and problems arising from the rules on the restitution of immovable property in the new Länder, were known and were the subject of comprehensive discussions before July 1994. Investment projects which were begun in the full knowledge that they could not be concluded in time and in respect of which the investment premium cannot therefore be claimed would nevertheless now be eligible for assistance, thus generating a windfall profit for undertakings which had originally calculated their investment in such a way that it would have been profitable even without such aid.
Undertakings which have taken investment decisions regarding the 8 % investment premium without allowing time for investment-related risks have accepted investment aid which turns out to be potentially lower than if they had met the requirements laid down in the Investment Premium Law 1993, and despite those risks have regarded their investment as profitable. The extension of the time-limit does not generate any extra investment and will probably have no effect on the termination of investment projects already begun.
Aid which does not stimulate any additional investment cannot be regarded as investment aid. State aid which, accordingly, constitutes only an additional payment that should not have been taken into account or which, according to the rules on regional investment aid applying at the time of the investment decision, was uncertain is to be regarded as operating aid for increasing the equity of the undertaking concerned, as was already explained by Germany before the initiation of the procedure in its communication of 19 December 1995.
In its Communication on the method for the application of Article 92(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty to regional aid (5), the Commission explained that operating aid, despite the fact that it is such as seriously to distort competition, may exceptionally be regarded in assisted areas as compatible with the common market in accordance with Article 92(3)(a), if it is necessary for the maintenance of the operation of existing plant. These considerations, however, do not apply to those undertakings which would benefit from the measure in question. Such undertakings decided before July 1994, with regard to the regional investment aid available under the law applicable at the time, to invest in the new Länder. Their investments were calculated in such a way that they would be achievable and show a steady profit without operating aid. There are therefore no extraordinary circumstances which would justify de facto operating aid in the form of an extension of the time-limit for claiming the 8 % investment premium as a contribution to the regional development of the disadvantaged regions.
This de facto operating aid would, moreover, not only stimulate the economy in eastern Germany. Undertakings which meet the conditions may also maintain plant elsewhere and could thus use the aid to finance activities outside eastern Germany.
The aid in question does not contribute, therefore, to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty, which the recipient undertakings under normal market conditions could not achieve either by their own efforts or with the help of existing approved State aid. The investment decisions were taken in the knowledge that the aid in question cannot be claimed if the time-limits are not observed. Aid which does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives recognised as justification for the exceptional approval of measures which distort competition cannot be regarded as compatible with the proper functioning of the common market (6).
The Federal Government's proposal to apply the amendment of the Investment Premium Law 1993 made by the Finance Law 1996 only to MIDER/Elf Aquitaine and to notify further cases individually in advance does not alter the assessment. The Finance Law is a law passed by the Bundestag which may be relied on directly by any undertaking which meets the general assistance conditions. The number of potential recipients cannot be determined with certainty.
The scope of the relevant provision of the Finance Law 1996 is not limited to the case of MIDER/Elf Aquitaine. There is no provision stating that it is up to the authorities to decide whether the premium will be granted. The commitment offered by Germany cannot effectively be made, since the Federal Government cannot declare a law passed by the Bundestag to be inapplicable or applicable on certain conditions. The authorities do not have the power to apply the relevant provision only in individual cases where it seems reasonable to them to do so. The relevant provision is therefore to be assessed with regard to all potential cases of application and not just to the MIDER case.
The above comments, however, are without prejudice to a possible individual notification by Germany of particular measures modifying the aid package for MIDER's investment in eastern Germany. Such an amendment would be examined by the Commission with regard to the special circumstances of this particular investment and the positive decision of the Commission on this project (7).
V
In conclusion, therefore, the Commission finds that the aid in question does not contribute to the promotion of additional investment in the new Länder and is not necessary for the maintenance of existing economic activities in them. As a result, the aid does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty and is not compatible therefore with the proper functioning of the common market.
The aid scheme was wrongly brought into force on 1 January 1996 without prior approval by the Commission. The Commission has noted that Germany has instructed the authorities in the new Länder to apply the Law only after it has been approved by the Commission. This communication, however, cannot be opposed to the direct application of a Federal law which gives all potential recipients who meet the conditions a legal claim, without a discretionary decision by the authorities being necessary,","{'title': '98/194/EC: Commission Decision of 1 October 1997 concerning the extension of the 8 % investment premium for investment projects in the new Länder pursuant to the Finance Law 1996 (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3 of the Investment Premium Law 1993 (InvZulG) was amended by Article 18(1) of the Finance Law 1996 (2) to the effect that the 8 % premium is now granted to investments which were begun after 31 December 1992 but before 1 July 1994 and which will be concluded before 1 January 1999.

By letter dated 17 November 1995, the Federal Ministry of Finance informed the Länder tax authorities that the said provision must not be applied before the Commission has approved the aid pursuant to Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. The letter was published in the Federal Tax Gazette (Bundessteuerblatt) 1996, Series I, No 1.', 'text': ""Article 3 of the Investment Premium Law 1993 (InvZulG) was amended by Article 18(1) of the Finance Law 1996 (2) to the effect that the 8 % premium is now granted to investments which were begun after 31 December 1992 but before 1 July 1994 and which will be concluded before 1 January 1999. This extended the time-limit for the implementation of assisted investment projects by two years, but did not change the provisions governing the start of the investment. The Finance Law 1996 came into force on 1 January 1996. By letter dated 17 November 1995, the Federal Ministry of Finance informed the Länder tax authorities that the said provision must not be applied before the Commission has approved the aid pursuant to Articles 92 and 93 of the EC Treaty. The letter was published in the Federal Tax Gazette (Bundessteuerblatt) 1996, Series I, No 1.\n\nII\n\nThe Commission was informed of the amendment to the Investment Premium Law in a communication dated 19 December 1995, i.e. six working days before the entry into force of the Finance Law 1996; the amendment was therefore registered as a non-notified aid (NN 6/96).\n\nOn 3 July 1996 the Commission decided, because the period in which the 8 % investment premium may be claimed was being extended, to initiate the procedure under Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty. Its reason for so doing was that the extension constituted additional State aid for investment projects which were begun before 1 July 1994 and which will be completed in 1997 and 1998, since no extra investment compared with the original situation was being promoted. The measure would therefore not assist any new investment projects which could contribute to the regional economic development of the former GDR.\n\nConsequently, the aid would only boost the equity of the undertakings which before July 1994 had begun to invest in the new Länder; it would accordingly have to be regarded as operating aid, which, as the Commission has consistently held, is compatible with the common market only if certain conditions are met and the aid serves exclusively to assist the economic development of areas in accordance with Article 92(3)(a) of the EC Treaty. The Commission took the view, however, that the aid could also stimulate economic development outside these assisted areas, with the result that the question was whether the aid could exceptionally be declared compatible with the common market.\n\nGermany was informed by letter dated 31 July 1996 (3) of the initiation of the procedure and, like the other Member States and interested parties, was invited by publication of that letter in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4) to submit its comments.\n\nGermany submitted its comments by letter dated 9 September 1996, and the French undertaking Elf Aquitaine SA (Elf) by letter dated 29 October 1996. On 30 October 1996, the French Government gave its views making reference to Elf's submission. It is clear from Elf's comments that the measure in question relates to investment by the Elf subsidiary Mitteldeutsche Erdöl-Raffinerie (MIDER), which is building a new refinery at Leuna in Saxony-Anhalt. As a result of unforeseen technical difficulties, which the undertaking says it is not responsible for, the investment has been delayed. Without the proposed extension of the time-limit, the investment premium for the entire project could not be claimed, which would put MIDER at a considerable economic disadvantage.\n\nThe letters from Elf and the French Government were forwarded for comment to the Federal Republic of Germany by letter dated 26 November 1996.\n\nBetween December 1996 and July 1997 the matter was discussed at several meetings between the German authorities and the Commission's departments.\n\nIII\n\nIn Germany's view, the extension of the time-limit for investment projects for which the 8 % investment premium can be claimed is compatible with the common market. The extension will avert a reduction of investment aid for large projects where delays have occurred on account of the particular circumstances in eastern Germany. In this way, the equity of undertakings investing in the new Länder will be increased, thus contributing to their economic stability. According to Germany, it is not known how many cases are affected by the general extension of the time-limit for claiming the investment premium. Basically, the extension applies to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been completed by the end of 1996.\n\nIn the MIDER/Leuna 2000 case, which the competent authorities had in mind when they proposed the said provision, the undertaking could not conclude the investment project in time by the end of 1996 on account of unforeseeable technical and administrative problems for which the undertaking could not be held responsible. The total aid package for the Leuna 2000 refinery would have been some DEM 360 million lower than had been accepted when the privatisation agreement was concluded. For legal reasons, it was not possible to pass a Federal law just for the MIDER case. The Federal Government, however, declared its readiness to apply the Investment Premium Law as amended by the Finance Law 1996 to MIDER only and to notify individually any further cases to which the amendment would apply.\n\nIV\n\nThe investment premium is State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the EC Treaty and Article 61(1) of the EEA Agreement.\n\nThe extension of the time-limit for investment projects in respect of which an 8 % premium can be requested from 2 >NUM>1/\n\n>DEN>2\n\nto 4 years to 4 >NUM>1/\n\n>DEN>2\n\nto 6 years constitutes additional State aid.\n\nHow many investment projects might be covered by the general extension of the time-limit is not known. Basically, the new time-limits apply to all investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and which had not been concluded by the end of 1996.\n\nUndertakings which began investment projects between January 1993 and June 1994 took their decision in the full knowledge that projects which were not completed by the end of 1996 either would not qualify at all for the investment premium, since the finished part would not be regarded as a complete but smaller than planned investment, or, if the part completed in time is treated as a full investment, albeit smaller than planned, would qualify only to a certain extent. The particular problems which prevent the swift implementation of complex investment projects on the territory of the former GDR, such as organisational difficulties of regional and local authorities, possible environmental burdens and problems arising from the rules on the restitution of immovable property in the new Länder, were known and were the subject of comprehensive discussions before July 1994. Investment projects which were begun in the full knowledge that they could not be concluded in time and in respect of which the investment premium cannot therefore be claimed would nevertheless now be eligible for assistance, thus generating a windfall profit for undertakings which had originally calculated their investment in such a way that it would have been profitable even without such aid.\n\nUndertakings which have taken investment decisions regarding the 8 % investment premium without allowing time for investment-related risks have accepted investment aid which turns out to be potentially lower than if they had met the requirements laid down in the Investment Premium Law 1993, and despite those risks have regarded their investment as profitable. The extension of the time-limit does not generate any extra investment and will probably have no effect on the termination of investment projects already begun.\n\nAid which does not stimulate any additional investment cannot be regarded as investment aid. State aid which, accordingly, constitutes only an additional payment that should not have been taken into account or which, according to the rules on regional investment aid applying at the time of the investment decision, was uncertain is to be regarded as operating aid for increasing the equity of the undertaking concerned, as was already explained by Germany before the initiation of the procedure in its communication of 19 December 1995.\n\nIn its Communication on the method for the application of Article 92(3)(a) and (c) of the EC Treaty to regional aid (5), the Commission explained that operating aid, despite the fact that it is such as seriously to distort competition, may exceptionally be regarded in assisted areas as compatible with the common market in accordance with Article 92(3)(a), if it is necessary for the maintenance of the operation of existing plant. These considerations, however, do not apply to those undertakings which would benefit from the measure in question. Such undertakings decided before July 1994, with regard to the regional investment aid available under the law applicable at the time, to invest in the new Länder. Their investments were calculated in such a way that they would be achievable and show a steady profit without operating aid. There are therefore no extraordinary circumstances which would justify de facto operating aid in the form of an extension of the time-limit for claiming the 8 % investment premium as a contribution to the regional development of the disadvantaged regions.\n\nThis de facto operating aid would, moreover, not only stimulate the economy in eastern Germany. Undertakings which meet the conditions may also maintain plant elsewhere and could thus use the aid to finance activities outside eastern Germany.\n\nThe aid in question does not contribute, therefore, to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty, which the recipient undertakings under normal market conditions could not achieve either by their own efforts or with the help of existing approved State aid. The investment decisions were taken in the knowledge that the aid in question cannot be claimed if the time-limits are not observed. Aid which does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives recognised as justification for the exceptional approval of measures which distort competition cannot be regarded as compatible with the proper functioning of the common market (6).\n\nThe Federal Government's proposal to apply the amendment of the Investment Premium Law 1993 made by the Finance Law 1996 only to MIDER/Elf Aquitaine and to notify further cases individually in advance does not alter the assessment. The Finance Law is a law passed by the Bundestag which may be relied on directly by any undertaking which meets the general assistance conditions. The number of potential recipients cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nThe scope of the relevant provision of the Finance Law 1996 is not limited to the case of MIDER/Elf Aquitaine. There is no provision stating that it is up to the authorities to decide whether the premium will be granted. The commitment offered by Germany cannot effectively be made, since the Federal Government cannot declare a law passed by the Bundestag to be inapplicable or applicable on certain conditions. The authorities do not have the power to apply the relevant provision only in individual cases where it seems reasonable to them to do so. The relevant provision is therefore to be assessed with regard to all potential cases of application and not just to the MIDER case.\n\nThe above comments, however, are without prejudice to a possible individual notification by Germany of particular measures modifying the aid package for MIDER's investment in eastern Germany. Such an amendment would be examined by the Commission with regard to the special circumstances of this particular investment and the positive decision of the Commission on this project (7).\n\nV\n\nIn conclusion, therefore, the Commission finds that the aid in question does not contribute to the promotion of additional investment in the new Länder and is not necessary for the maintenance of existing economic activities in them. As a result, the aid does not contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives referred to in Article 92(2) and (3) of the EC Treaty and is not compatible therefore with the proper functioning of the common market.\n\nThe aid scheme was wrongly brought into force on 1 January 1996 without prior approval by the Commission. The Commission has noted that Germany has instructed the authorities in the new Länder to apply the Law only after it has been approved by the Commission. This communication, however, cannot be opposed to the direct application of a Federal law which gives all potential recipients who meet the conditions a legal claim, without a discretionary decision by the authorities being necessary,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:""}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '18', 'title': 'Article 18(1) of the Finance Law 1996, which amends Article 3 of the Investment Premium Law 1993 to the effect that the 8 % investment premium is now granted for investment projects which were begun after 31 December 1992 and before 1 July 1994 and are completed before 1 January 1999 (instead of before 1 January 1997), introduces new, additional State aid for undertakings which have made investments in the new Länder.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) The maximum residue limit (hereinafter ‘MRL’) for pharmacologically active substances intended for use in the Union in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals or in biocidal products used in animal husbandry is to be established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009.
(2) Pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding MRLs in foodstuffs of animal origin are set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 (2).
(3) Rafoxanide is currently included in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 as an allowed substance, for bovine and ovine species, applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals producing milk for human consumption.
(4) A request for an opinion on the extrapolation of the existing entry for rafoxanide applicable to bovine milk has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.
(5) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use has recommended the establishment of a provisional MRL for rafoxanide for bovine and ovine milk and the removal of the prohibition to use that substance in animals from which milk is produced for human consumption.
(6) The entry for rafoxanide in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the recommended provisional MRL for bovine and ovine milk and to remove the prohibition to use that substance from animals from which milk is produced for human consumption.
(7) The provisional MRL for rafoxanide set out in that Table should expire on 31 December 2015.

Whereas there is now accumulated knowledge and data available concerning the necessary prerequisites for safety to human health and the environment for the release of certain types of GMOs;
Whereas it is considered appropriate that given the different safety concerns for different types of organsims, separate criteria should be established for plants, animals and micro-organisms and that accordingly, the criteria established by this  Decision are applicable only in relation to genetically modified plants, which is the group of GMOs with which most of the experience has been acquired to date;
Whereas evidence from releases of genetically modified plants has indicated that the safety of releases of such plants depends on the characteristics of the recipient plant species, on the characteristics of the inserted sequences and their products,  and on the receiving ecosystems, and whereas the criteria to be established should be aimed specifically at the evaluation of these characteristics;
Whereas these criteria form an objective and harmonized basis for decisions on the requests for application of simplified procedures;
Whereas is is appropriate, in the interest of transparency, to establish a uniform procedure for the making of a request for simplified procedures;
Whereas, such a request should be based on experience with the GMOs under consideration and on the evidence of safety for human health and the environment and whereas, to these ends, it is appropriate that this experience may include the competent  authority's own experience with releases of the same GMOs and the experience in similar ecosystems whether within the Community or internationally, of the GMOs under consideration;
Whereas it is important, in the interests of the greatest possible applicability of uniform procedures, compatible with considerations of safety to human health and the environment, that all Member States should have the opportunity to join in any  request for the application of simplified procedures and whereas to this effect an appropriate procedure should be established;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (1), and in particular Article 19(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 62 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (2) provides that the revenues of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should also consist of fees paid to ESMA in cases specified in Union legislation alongside contributions from national public authorities and a subsidy from the Union.
(2) To ensure an efficient use of ESMA’s budget and, at the same time, alleviate the financial burden for Member States and the Union, it is necessary to ensure that credit rating agencies pay at least all the costs related to their supervision. Any deficit that may occur during 1 financial year should be recovered from credit rating agencies in the following year.
(3) An annual supervisory fee should be charged to credit rating agencies exceeding a certain threshold of turnover in order to provide for budgetary certainty for both ESMA and the credit rating agencies concerned. Annual supervisory fees should not become a burden for new entrants to the credit rating market. Moreover, small credit rating agencies are expected to engender significantly less supervisory costs than larger ones. It would be therefore proportionate to fully exempt small credit rating agencies from paying the annual supervisory fee where the credit rating agency or the group of credit rating agencies to which it belong do not exceed a certain threshold of turnover.
(4) In order to ensure a fair and clear allocation of fees which, at the same time, reflects the actual administrative burden per supervised entity, the supervisory fee should be calculated according to the credit rating agencies’ turnover, generated from rating activities and ancillary services, since the cost of supervision is higher for larger credit rating agencies than for smaller ones. Moreover, the provision of ancillary services requires additional supervisory effort as possible conflicts of interests resulting from the provision of ancillary services need monitoring. Credit rating agencies should not circumvent the fair allocation of fees according to this Regulation by reallocating revenue to other entities within their group in order to reduce their fee contributions. ESMA should monitor and report any critical developments in this respect.
(5) A registration fee should be charged to credit rating agencies established in the Union to reflect ESMA’s costs for processing the application for registration. The complexity of an application and costs associated to assessing the application increase where a credit rating agency applies for issuing ratings for structured finance instruments or plans to endorse ratings from third country agencies or has branches. Therefore the registration fee should be calculated according to those factors. The processing costs also depend to a large extent on the size of the applicant credit rating agency. As the future turnover of a new credit rating agency would not be known at the moment of its application for registration, the number of employees should replace turnover as a common basis for calculation of all credit rating agencies.
(6) This Regulation should provide for fees to be charged to third country credit rating agencies that apply for certification in the Union according to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 in order to cover their certification and annual supervisory costs. In this regard, ESMA’s necessary expenditure relates to the certification of such third country credit rating agencies according to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 which follows a similar procedure as the one applicable to the registration of credit rating agencies established in the Union, as well as ESMA’s expenditure necessary for the supervision of certified credit rating agencies.
(7) Credit rating agencies should be reimbursed a percentage of the fee initially charged for their registration or certification when withdrawing their application during the registration or certification process as ESMA’s costs for processing the application would be lower in such cases.
(8) In view of possible future developments, it is appropriate for the thresholds for exempting credit rating agencies from paying annual supervisory fees and the amounts of registration and certification fees to be reviewed and updated as necessary. The Commission should assess the correct application of these measures within 4 years from the entry into force of this Regulation and report to the European Parliament and the Council on the possible need to review it.
(9) National competent authorities incur costs when carrying out tasks delegated to them by ESMA in accordance with Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 and when providing assistance to ESMA in the other cases specified in that Regulation. The fees to be charged by ESMA to credit rating agencies should also cover those costs. In order to avoid that competent authorities incur loss or realise profit from carrying out delegated tasks or from assisting ESMA, ESMA should reimburse the actual costs incurred by that national competent authority.
(10) This Regulation should form the basis for ESMA’s right to charge fees to credit rating agencies. In order to immediately facilitate effective and efficient supervisory and enforcement activity, it should enter into force on the third day following its publication,","{'header': '28.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 90/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 272/2012\nof 7 February 2012\nsupplementing Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to fees charged by the European Securities and Markets Authority to credit rating agencies\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 62 of Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)(2)provides that the revenues of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) should also consist of fees paid to ESMA in cases specified in Union legislation alongside contributions from national public authorities and a subsidy from the Union.\n\n((2)) To ensure an efficient use of ESMA’s budget and, at the same time, alleviate the financial burden for Member States and the Union, it is necessary to ensure that credit rating agencies pay at least all the costs related to their supervision.

(1) Directive 2004/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) establishes minimum health and safety requirements to protect workers against the risks arising from exposure to electromagnetic fields. Article 13(1) of that Directive provides that Member States are to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive no later than 30 April 2008.
(2) Directive 2004/40/EC provides for action values and limit values based on the recommendations of the International Commission for Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). New scientific studies on the impact on health of exposure to electromagnetic radiation, made public after the Directive was adopted, have been brought to the attention of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The results of those scientific studies are currently being examined by the ICNIRP as part of the ongoing review of its recommendations on the one hand, and by the World Health Organisation as part of the review of its environmental health criteria on the other. Those new recommendations, due to be published by the end of 2008, are likely to contain elements that could lead to substantial amendments to the action and limit values.
(3) In this context, the potential impact of the implementation of Directive 2004/40/EC on the use of medical procedures based on medical imaging and certain industrial activities should be reconsidered thoroughly. A study has been launched by the Commission to assess directly and quantitatively the situation regarding medical imaging. The results of that study, which are expected in early 2008, should therefore be taken on board, in addition to the results of similar studies launched in the Member States, in order to ensure a balance between the prevention of potential risks to the health of workers and access to the benefits available from the effective use of the medical technologies in question.
(4) Article 3(3) of Directive 2004/40/EC provides that the assessment, measurement and/or calculation of workers' exposure to electromagnetic fields are governed by harmonised European standards of the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec). These harmonised standards, which are essential for ensuring smooth application of the Directive, must be taken into account and are expected in 2008.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 52(3)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (2), France’s application to register the name ‘Gruyère’ as a protected geographical indication (PGI) was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3).
(2) Australia, New Zealand and the US Dairy Export Council together with the National Milk Producers Federation of the United States submitted objections to the registration pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. These objections were deemed admissible under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The objections concerned non-compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, in particular as regards the fact that the name does not refer to a geographical area. The generic nature of the name and the harm caused to names, trademarks and products that have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of publication provided for in Article 6(2) were also invoked. The objections further claimed that registration of the name in question would be contrary to Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(4) By letters of 23 May 2011, the Commission asked France and the objectors to seek agreement among themselves.
(5) Given that no agreement was reached within the designated timeframe, the Commission should adopt a decision.
(6) Concerning the alleged failure of the name ‘Gruyère’ to comply with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, it should be noted that this name is a traditional name within the meaning of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 and may therefore be registered.
(7) The objectors submitted several pieces of evidence that show, according to them, that the name in question is generic. It is, however, clear that the inclusion of a term given in Annex B to the Stresa Convention of 1951 does not imply that the said term has become ipso facto generic. Tariff codes and other similar provisions regarding the name ‘Gruyère’ relate specifically to customs issues and are therefore in no way relevant to the protection of intellectual property rights or to consumer protection. Furthermore, the data submitted concerning, in particular, the production of ‘Gruyère’ outside the European Union are not relevant considering the principle of territoriality, according to which the generic nature of a name must be evaluated in relation to the territory of the EU.
(8) The registration of homonymous names is authorised on condition that the name registered subsequently is sufficiently distinct in practice from the name already subject to protection. In accordance with the joint statement annexed to the agreement between the European Union and Switzerland on geographical indications (4), France and Switzerland have been consulted in order to identify any additional labelling measures necessary in order to avoid misleading consumers.
(9) As a result of these consultations it appeared necessary to indicate the country of origin, in this case France, on the label in the same field of vision as the name ‘Gruyère’, in letters of the same size as those of the name. In addition, the use of any flags, emblems, signs or other graphic representations on the labels should be prohibited if it might mislead consumers, in particular as regards the characteristics, origin or provenance of the product.
(10) In the light of the above, the name ‘Gruyère’ should be entered in the ‘register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications’.
(11) The granting and duration of the five-year transitional period referred to in Article 8(3) of the Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation is not being called into question by the registration of the name ‘Gruyère’ for France under this Regulation.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,","{'header': '7.2.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 36/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 110/2013\nof 6 February 2013\nentering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications [Gruyère (PGI)]', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs(2), France’s application to register the name ‘Gruyère’ as a protected geographical indication (PGI) was published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(3).\n\n((2)) Australia, New Zealand and the US Dairy Export Council together with the National Milk Producers Federation of the United States submitted objections to the registration pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, submitted after consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for pursuant to the above Regulation,
Whereas:
(1) In 1991, the Commission, by Decision 91/512/EEC (2), accepted undertakings in connection with the anti-dumping proceedings concerning imports of artificial corundum originating in the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the People's  Republic of China, Brazil and Yugoslavia, and terminated the investigation. No residual anti-dumping duties were imposed at that time since, in particular, the USSR and Chinese exporters, which actually gave the undertakings, held a monopoly on exports  of the product concerned from their countries.
(2) Subsequently, the USSR exporter, V/O Stankoimport, lost its monopoly on exports. Exports are now carried out by a number of new exporters, located in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. As far as China is concerned, undertakings were accepted from  six trade organizations authorized by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to export this product from China. The Commission has now found that exports are being made from China by other exporters and trade organizations previously unknown to the Commission.  It has also been established that exports of artificial corundum from China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine have taken place in substantial quantities and at prices well below the undertaking prices.
(3) The effect of this development is that the existing measures for China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine have become ineffective. Furthermore, the current situation discriminates against the exporters which undertook not to sell artificial  corundum below certain price levels and thus to eliminate the injurious effect of dumping.
(4) The Council, therefore, considers that the facts as outlined above now require the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty, on the basis of the findings set out in Decision 91/512/EEC which the Council still considers valid, on imports of  artificial corundum originating in the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The Council further considers that the findings of the investigation carried out prior to its adoption remain reliable and that duties may therefore  still be based on them. The exporters which had undertakings accepted and respected their provisions should continue to be exempt from the anti-dumping duty.
(5) Consequently, a definitive anti-dumping duty should be imposed at the rates corresponding to those established in the above investigation, i.e. 30,8 % in respect of the People's Republic of China and 9,8 % in respect of the Russian Federation and  Ukraine.
(6) Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 provides for measures to lapse after five years from the date on which they entered into force or were last modified or confirmed. Although the measures provided for by this Regulation imposing  definitive anti-dumping duties are linked to the undertakings accepted by Decision 91/512/EEC, this Regulation does not amend or confirm the latter within the meaning of Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 and consequently the date on which  the undertakings were due to expire pursuant to Article 15 (1) remains unchanged,","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EEC) No 2552/93 of 13 September 1993 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of artificial corundum originating in the People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, with the exception of those imports sold for export to the Community by companies whose undertakings have been accepted"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania, and in particular paragraph 4 of Chapter 3 of Annex V thereto,
Whereas:
(1) Paragraph 2 of Chapter 3 of Annex V to the Act of Accession of Bulgaria and Romania provides that any stock of product, private as well as public, in free circulation at the date of accession within the territory of Bulgaria and Romania (the new Member States) exceeding the quantity which could be regarded as constituting a normal carry-over of stock must be eliminated at the expense of the new Member States. The concept of normal carry-over stock shall be defined for each product on the basis of criteria and objectives specific to each common market organisation.
(2) Both the criteria and objectives particular to each market organisation and the relationship between prices in the new Member States before accession and Community prices mean that normal carry-over stock should be assessed in the light of factors varying from sector to sector.
(3) The basis for calculating levels of surplus stocks should be the variation in domestic production plus imports less exports in 2006, compared to the average of variation in domestic production plus imports less exports for the three previous years.
(4) The results of the calculation should be adjusted to take into consideration that some categories of products, such as butter and butter-oil, different qualities of rice, hops, seeds, wine alcohol, tobacco, and cereals are effectively interchangeable and could be considered as a group, so that an increase in stock levels of certain products in a group may be offset by a reduction in stock levels of other products in the group.
(5) In order to take into account economic growth during the period evaluated for the surplus stock exercise and the resulting possible increase in food consumption, a linear trend function has been introduced, using the production and trade figures of 2003-2005 as a baseline. In cases where linear trend function would have resulted in a higher surplus, the average of variation in domestic production plus imports less exports for the three previous years was used.
(6) A threshold was used to eliminate minor surpluses: if the amount of surplus stock of a particular product was no more than 10 % of what could be regarded as a ‘normal carry-over stock’ for that product, it was considered that Member States should not be charged. This 10 % covers the margin of error of the statistical information gathered in the particular circumstances of the pre-accession period and the complexity and scope of this exercise.
(7) The Commission also invited the new Member States to present any arguments on specific situations which would justify higher than normal stocks and evaluated them. The latter did not result in changes to the figures established according to the methodology described in recitals 1 to 6.
(8) The calculation should be based on official Eurostat data transmitted by the Member States, where this is available. In cases where such data are not available due to statistical confidentiality, data sent officially to the Commission by the new Member States should be used.
(9) As regards Bulgaria, the mathematical application of the methodology described in recitals 1 to 6 to the statistical information referred to in recital 8 gives the result that no surplus stocks are found, without the need to consider any arguments on specific situations as described in recital 7.
(10) For calculating the financial consequences of the surplus stocks, the cost of their disposal should be calculated. In the absence of export refunds for preserved mushrooms for which significant levels of surplus stocks have been established, for an equivalent approach, it is appropriate to take as a basis the price differences between the average internal and external prices. In view of the temporary nature of the financial consequences arising from the establishment of surplus stocks, the corresponding amounts should be paid by the Member States concerned into the Union’s budget. It is necessary to fix the date on which these payments should be made. Taking into account the current difficult economic circumstances pointed out by Romania, it has been considered appropriate to extend over four years the period for the payment of these amounts.

on the approval of two Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternators as the innovative technologies for reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emissions performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular Article 12(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The supplier Robert Bosch GmbH (the ‘Applicant’) submitted the following two applications for the approval of the Robert Bosch GmbH efficient alternators as innovative technologies on 2 December 2013 and 6 May 2014 respectively:
No Innovative technology
1 High efficient alternator with high efficiency diodes (HED)
2 High efficient alternator with synchronous active rectification (SAR)
(2) The completeness of two applications was assessed in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 (2). The Commission identified certain relevant information as missing in the original application for innovative technology No 1 and requested the Applicant to complete it. The Applicant provided the information on 6 May 2014. Both applications were found to be complete and the period for the Commission's assessment of the applications started on the day following the date of official receipt, i.e. 7 May 2014 in both cases.
(3) Both applications have been assessed in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 and the Technical Guidelines for the preparation of applications for the approval of innovative technologies pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (the Technical Guidelines) (3).
(4) The application No 1 refers to the Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternator with HED. The high efficient alternator with HED use optimised component designs and high efficiency diodes. In addition, to the new diode technology of HED, the Applicant's alternator has an increased efficiency compared to the baseline alternator by: reduction of iron losses by optimisation of steel and lamination, optimisation of iron length and tooth cross section, optimisation of air gap between rotor and stator and optimisation of chamber of the rotor claw poles, and optimisation of phase resistance. This technology is therefore different from the other efficient generation alternators approved as eco-innovation by Commission Implementing Decision 2013/341/EU (4) and Commission Implementing Decision 2014/465/EU (5).
(5) The application No 2 refers to the Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternator with SAR. The high efficient alternator with SAR has an efficiency of at least 78 %. Main efficiency increase is achieved by the introduction of the active rectification using MOSFET, i.e. by a use of metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor technology. In addition, the Applicant's high efficient alternator with SAR has an increased efficiency compared to the baseline alternator by: reduction of iron losses by optimisation of steel and lamination, optimisation of iron length and tooth cross section, optimisation of air gap between rotor and stator and optimisation of chamber of the rotor claw poles, and optimisation of phase resistance. This technology is therefore different from the other efficient generation alternators approved as eco-innovation by Implementing Decision 2013/341/EU and Implementing Decision 2014/465/EU, and from the high efficient alternator with HED as per application No 1.
(6) The Commission finds that the information provided in both applications demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.
(7) The Applicant has demonstrated that both high efficiency alternators of the kind described in this application did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009.
(8) In order to determine the CO2 savings that the innovative technology will deliver when fitted to a vehicle, it is necessary to define the baseline vehicle against which the efficiency of the vehicle equipped with the innovative technology should be compared as provided for in Articles 5 and 8 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011. The Commission finds that it is appropriate to consider an alternator with 67 % efficiency as an appropriate baseline technology in the case the innovative technology is fitted on a new vehicle type. Where the Robert Bosch GmbH efficient alternators are fitted to an existing vehicle type, the baseline technology should be the alternator of the most recent version of that type placed on the market.
(9) The Applicant in both applications has provided a methodology for testing the CO2 reductions which includes formulae that are consistent with the formulae described in the Technical Guidelines for the simplified approach with regard to efficient alternators. The Commission considers that the testing methodology will provide testing results that are verifiable, repeatable and comparable and that it is capable of demonstrating in a realistic manner the CO2 emissions benefits of the innovative technology with strong statistical significance in accordance with Article 6 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.
(10) The Commission notes that the Applicant's testing methodology and formulae to calculate the CO2 savings in both cases are in all aspects identical to the methodology specified in the Annex to Implementing Decision 2013/341/EU. As a consequence, the Commission considers that the methodology specified in Implementing Decision 2013/341/EU should be used to determine the reduction in CO2 emissions due to the use of the Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternator with HED and Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternator with SAR.
(11) Against that background the Commission finds that the Applicant has demonstrated satisfactorily that the emission reduction achieved by the innovative technology is at least 1 g CO2/km.
(12) The Commission notes that the savings of both innovative technologies may be partially demonstrated on the standard test cycle, and the final total savings to be certified should therefore be determined in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 8(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.
(13) The Commission finds that in both cases the verification report has been prepared by the TÜV SÜD Industrie Service GmbH which is an independent and certified body and that the report supports the findings set out in the applications.
(14) Against that background, the Commission finds that no objections should be raised as regards the approval of both innovative technologies in question.
(15) For the purposes of determining the general eco-innovation code to be used in the relevant type approval documents in accordance with Annexes I, VIII and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), the individual codes to be used for the innovative technology approved through this Implementing Decision should be specified.
(16) Any manufacturer wishing to benefit from a reduction of its average specific CO2 emissions for the purpose of meeting its specific emissions target by means of the CO2 savings from the use of the innovative technology approved by this Implementing Decision, should in accordance with Article 11(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011, refer to this Decision in its application for an EC type-approval certificate for the vehicles concerned,","{'header': '31.1.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 26/31', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/158\nof 30 January 2015\non the approval of two Robert Bosch GmbH high efficient alternators as the innovative technologies for reducing CO2emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No\xa0443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The supplier Robert Bosch GmbH (the ‘Applicant’) submitted the following two applications for the approval of the Robert Bosch GmbH efficient alternators as innovative technologies on 2 December 2013 and 6 May 2014 respectively:NoInnovative technology1High efficient alternator with high efficiency diodes (HED)2High efficient alternator with synchronous active rectification (SAR)\n\n(No) Innovative technology\n\n(1) High efficient alternator with high efficiency diodes (HED)\n\n(2) High efficient alternator with synchronous active rectification (SAR)\n\n((2)) The completeness of two applications was assessed in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011(2).

(1) On 6 February 2007, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the competent authority of the Netherlands an application, in accordance with Article 5 and Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 89034 × MON 88017 maize (the application).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of MON 89034 × MON 88017 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with Article 5(5) and Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. It also includes a monitoring plan for environmental effects conforming with Annex VII to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 30 March 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Article 6 and Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. It considered that maize MON 89034 × MON 88017 is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health or the environment. Therefore it concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 89034 × MON 88017 maize as described in the application (the products) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses (3). In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 6(4) and Article 18(4) of that Regulation.
(4) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(5) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(6) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(7) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Article 13(1) and Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 89034 × MON 88017 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements in Article 4(6) for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(9) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(10) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(11) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (7).
(12) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(13) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chair and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since, at its meeting on 17 March 2011, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal and the Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded, these measures are to be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '23.6.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 163/55', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 17 June 2011\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize MON 89034\xa0×\xa0MON 88017 (MON-89Ø34-3xMON-88Ø17-3) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2011) 4164)\n(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/366/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 6 February 2007, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the competent authority of the Netherlands an application, in accordance with Article 5 and Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON 89034\xa0×\xa0MON 88017 maize (the application).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of MON 89034\xa0×\xa0MON 88017 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation.

the circulator and in the technical documentation of the product as follows: “EEI ≤ 0,[\nxx\n]”.’;\n(2)\nAnnex II, point 2, is replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY INDEX\nThe methodology for calculating the energy efficiency index (EEI) for circulators is as follows:\n1.\nStandalone circulators with pump housing shall be measured as a complete unit;\nStandalone circulators without pump housing shall be measured with pump housing identical to the pump housing in which they are intended to be used;\nCirculators integrated in products shall be dismantled from the product and measured with a reference pump housing;\nCirculators without pump housing intended to be integrated in a product shall be measured with a reference pump housing;\nwhere “reference pump housing” means a pump housing supplied by the manufacturer with inlet and outlet ports on the same axis and designed to be connected to the pipework of a heating system or secondary circuit of a cooling distribution system.\n2.\nWhere a circulator has more than one setting of head and flow, measure the circulator at the maximum setting.\n“Head” (H) means head (in metres) produced by the\xa0circulator at the specified point of operation.\n“Flow” (Q) means the volume flow rate of water through the circulator (m\n3\n/hr).\n3.\nFind the point where\nQ · H\nis maximum and define the flow and head at this point as:\nQ\n100\xa0%\nand\nH\n100\xa0%\n.\n4.\nCalculate the hydraulic power\nP\nhyd\nat this point.\n“Hydraulic power” means an expression of the arithmetic product of the flow (Q), Head (H) and a constant.\n“P\nhyd\n” means hydraulic power delivered by the circulator to the fluid being pumped at the specified point of operation (in watts).\n5.\nCalculate the reference power as:\nP\nref\n= 1,7 ·\nP\nhyd\n+ 17 · (1 –\ne\n– 0,3 · P\nhyd\n), 1 W ≤ P\nhyd\n≤ 2\xa0500 W\n“Reference power” means a relation between hydraulic power and power consumption of a circulator, taking into account the dependency between circulator efficiency and size.\n“P\nref\n” means the reference power (in watts) of the circulator in a given head and flow.\n6.\nDefine the reference control curve as the straight line between the points:\n(\nQ\n100\xa0%\n,\nH\n100\xa0%\n) and (\nQ\n0\xa0%\n,\n)\n7.\nSelect a setting of the circulator ensuring that the circulator on the selected curve reaches\nQ\xa0·\xa0H = max point\n. For circulators integrated in products follow the reference control curve by adjusting the system curve and speed of the circulator.\n“System curve” means a relationship between flow and head (\nH\n= f(\nQ\n)) resulting from friction in the heating system or cooling distribution system, as presented in the following graph:\n8.\nMeasure\nP\n1\nand\nH\nat the flows:\nQ\n100 %\n, 0,75 ·\nQ\n100 %\n, 0,5 ·\nQ\n100 %\n, 0,25 ·\nQ\n100 %\n“\nP\n1\n” means the electrical power (in watts) consumed by the circulator at the specified point of operation.\n9.\nCalculate\nP\nL\nas follows:\n, if H\nmeas\n≤ H\nref\nP\nL\n= P\n1,meas\n, if H\nmeas\n> H\nref\nWhere\nH\nref\nis the head on the reference control curve at the different flows.\n10.\nUsing the measured values of\nP\nL\nand this load profile:\nFlow [%]\nTime [%]\n100\n6\n75\n15\n50\n35\n25\n44\nCalculate the weighted average power\nP\nL,avg\nas:\nP\nL,avg\n= 0,06 · P\nL, 100\xa0%\n+ 0,15 · P\nL, 75\xa0%\n+ 0,35 · P\nL, 50\xa0%\n+ 0,44 · P\nL, 25\xa0%\nCalculate the energy efficiency index\n(\n*1\n)\nas:\n, where\nC\n20\xa0%\n= 0,49\nExcept for circulators integrated in products designed for primary circuits of thermal solar systems and for heat pumps, where the energy efficiency index is calculated as:\nwhere\nC\n20\xa0%\n= 0,49 and\nn\ns\nis the specific speed defined as\nwhere\nn\ns\n[rpm] is specific speed of a circulator;\nn\n100\xa0%\nis rotational speed in rpm in this duty defined at\nQ\n100\xa0%\nand\nH\n100\xa0%.\n(\n*1\n)\nC\nXX\xa0%\nmeans a scaling factor that ensures that at the time of defining the scaling factor only XX\xa0% of circulators of a certain type have an EEI\xa0≤\xa00,20.’.""\n(\n*1\n)\nC\nXX\xa0%\nmeans a scaling factor that ensures that at the time of defining the scaling factor only XX\xa0% of circulators of a certain type have an EEI\xa0≤\xa00,20.’.”'}]}"

Such fixing must be transitional and may not prejudge the outcome of the negotiations under way in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as a result of the accession of the new members. In addition, it should not preclude the possibility of an increase if need be to meet requirements justified by demand.
(5) This additional quantity must be managed using the mechanisms and instruments put in place by Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 to manage the existing tariff quotas. However, because these arrangements are transitional, this additional quantity must be managed separately from the tariff quotas.
(6) Under the mechanisms introduced by Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, the additional quantity must be distributed between the two categories of operators defined in Article 2 of that Regulation and rules must be adopted for determining a specific reference quantity for each traditional operator and a specific allocation for each non-traditional operator. It should be specified that the distribution referred to above and the determination of the reference quantities and allocations concern operators who have supplied the markets of the new Member States during the years prior to accession.
(7) For the purposes of determining the reference quantities of traditional operators, the three-year reference period 2000, 2001 and 2002 laid down in Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 838/2004 should be retained, as should the average of primary imports carried out during that period by each traditional operator registered in accordance with the transitional measures adopted in 2004, following checks carried out by the competent authorities. The provisions to be adopted must, however, allow applications submitted by traditional operators who were not registered in 2004 to be taken into account, provided that these applications meet the conditions laid down for the registration of these operators in Commission Regulations (EC) No 414/2004 (4) and (EC) No 838/2004, in particular as regards the definition of primary imports and the proof that such operations have supplied the markets of the new Member States during the period concerned.
(8) As regards new non-traditional operators, provision should be made for their registration on the basis of their having been engaged in the commercial activity of importing bananas, in one of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004, in accordance with Articles 6, 7 and 8 of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001.
(9) With a view to managing this available quantity, adjustment coefficients to be applied to the quantities notified by the Member States should be fixed.
(10) In order to ensure satisfactory market supply, and in particular to ensure a continual flow of imports into the new Member States, the transitional measures should include the issue of licences with a view to release for free circulation in a new Member State. Accordingly, securities lodged should be released in proportion to the quantities released for free circulation in a new Member State.

Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (1), and in particular Article 19(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2003/804/EC (2) sets out a temporary list of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import live molluscs, their eggs and gametes for further growth, fattening, relaying or human consumption into the Community, as well as model certificates that must accompany consignments of such products.
(2) Canada, Croatia, Morocco, New Zealand, Tunisia, Turkey and the United States of America have been included in that temporary list, based on current trade with Member States, while awaiting Community assessment of the guarantees these third countries can provide with respect to mollusc diseases.
(3) The animal health guarantees provided by Morocco, New Zealand, Tunisia and Turkey have been assessed by the Commission, and found not to meet all the requirements laid down in Directive 91/67/EEC and Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs (3).
(4) Canada and New Zealand have notified the Commission that they have no current interest in exporting live molluscs for further growth, fattening or relaying to the Community.
(5) The United States of America has submitted its programme for export certification of mollusc farming areas. That programme has been assessed by the Commission, and found to provide the necessary guarantees for export of live molluscs for further growth, fattening or relaying into the Community.
(6) Croatia is not authorised for export of live molluscs for human consumption, pursuant to Commission Decision 97/20/EC of 17 December 1996 establishing the list of third countries fulfilling the equivalence conditions for the production and placing on the market of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods (4). Accordingly, imports of such mollusc from that country should not be authorised under Decision 2003/804/EC.
(7) It is also appropriate to simplify the table in Annex I to Decision 2003/804/EC.

(3) Sweden requested on 8 July 2002 and 30 June 2003 that the Commission amend certain aspects of Decision 96/228/EC and subsequently presented additional information in support of its requests.
(4) In the abovementioned letters Sweden requested that certain unit aid levels should be increased. These modifications take account the change in the level of compensatory allowances and are not likely to lead to any increase in overall support.
(5) Experience has shown that the precautionary measure to prevent possible increases in production that benefit from aid is no longer needed. Furthermore, limitations in aid amounts and the number of units covered by aid supply the same need.
(6) The rates of Community aid foreseen have been modified. Thus, they do not serve the original purpose anymore and there is no need to define them beforehand.
(7) Decision 96/228/EC should be amended accordingly.
(8) In view of the nature and scope of the amendments, and at the request of Sweden, it should be provided that the amendment takes effect from 1 January 2003.","{'title': '2004/291/EC: Commission Decision of 30 March 2004 amending Decision 96/228/EC on a long-term national aid scheme to assist farmers in northern areas of Sweden (notified under document number C(2004) 966)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 96/228/EC is amended as follows:\n\n1.

laying down transitory measures arising from the adoption of improved trade arrangements concerning the export of certain processed agricultural products to Romania
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products (1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Community has recently concluded a trade agreement for processed agricultural products with Romania in preparation for its accession to the Community. This agreement provides for concessions involving on the Community side the abolition of export refunds on certain processed agricultural products.
(2) EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 of 5 July 2005 concerning the improvement of the trade arrangements for processed agricultural products provided in Protocol 3 of the Europe Agreement (2) provides for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Romania, from 1 December 2005.
(3) In return for the abolition of export refunds as set out in EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005, the Romanian authorities have undertaken to grant reciprocal preferential import arrangements to goods imported into their territory if the goods concerned are accompanied by a copy of the export declaration containing a special mention indicating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds. The full rate of duty applies in the absence of such documentation.
(4) With the entry into force of EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005, goods for which operators have applied for refund certificates in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3) will no longer be eligible for refund when they are exported to Romania.
(5) Reduction of refund certificates and pro rata release of the corresponding security should be allowed where operators can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the national competent authority that their claims for refunds have been affected by the entry into force of EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005. When assessing requests for reduction of the amount of the refund certificate and proportional release of the relevant security, the national competent authority should, in cases of doubt, have regard in particular to the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89 of 21 December 1989 on scrutiny by Member States of transactions forming part of the system of financing by the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and repealing Directive 77/435/EEC (4) without prejudice to the application of the other provisions of that Regulation. For administrative reasons it is appropriate to provide that requests for reduction of the amount of the refund certificate and release of the security are to be made within a short period and that the amounts for which reductions have been accepted are to be notified to the Commission in time for their inclusion in the determination of the amount for which refund certificates for use from 1 February 2006 shall be issued, pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),

Whereas the Community framework for computerizing administrative procedures should cover the following six fields: intra-Community trade, third country trade (imports and exports), trader interfaces, Commission systems, systems interconnection and data interchange standards;
Whereas, in the case of intra-Community trade, the computerization of administrative procedures must proceed in harmony with the results of actions aimed at creating all the conditions for the achievement of a single market in the Community by 1992 at the latest;
Whereas the Commission should be responsible for adopting the measures necessary for the coordinated development of computerized administrative procedures (CD project); whereas the Commission and each of the Member States must remain responsible for implementing their own computer systems, taking into account the objectives of the CD project; whereas these objectives are an integral part of the more general framework of the Cooperation in Automation of Data and Documentation for Imports/Exports and Agriculture (CADDIA) programme (5); whereas at the present stage it is therefore necessary to make the duration of the CD project and that of the CADDIA programme coincide; whereas, in order to assist the Commission in the implementation of the CD project, a Management Committee for the project should be set up; whereas an appropriate procedure should be laid down which allows the Commission to adopt Community measures in certain fields for the implementation of the CD project;

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 7 November 1986
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain tube and pipe fittings originating in Brazil, Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Japan
(86/536/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulations (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In November 1984, the Commission received a complaint concerning imports of certain tube and pipe fittings originating in Brazil, Taiwan and Yugoslavia which was lodged by the European Malleable Tube Fittings Development Association (EMAFIDA) on behalf of producers representing substantially all Community production of the product in question.
In March 1985 the Italian producer who is the largest producer in the Community and whose production accounts for a major proportion of the Community's production lodged a complaint concerning imports of the product in question originating in Japan.
Both complaints contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain tube and pipe fittings of malleable cast iron falling within Common Customs Tariff heading ex 73.20, corresponding to NIMEXE code 73.20-30 originating in Brazil, Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Japan.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) All companies concerned having exported the product in question to the Community during the period under investigation made their views known in writing. The majority of the known exporters requested and were granted hearings. Some importers also made written submissions and requested hearings which were granted.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
(a) EEC producers:
- Georg Fischer AG, Singen (Hohentwiel), Germany,
- R. Woeste & Co., Duesseldorf, Germany,
- Acciaierie e Ferriere Lombarde Falck SpA., Milano, Italy;
(b) Non-EEC producers/exporters:
- Fundiรงao Tupy SA, Joinville, SC, Brazil,
- De HoMetal Industrial Co. Ltd, Hsinchu, Taiwan,
- San Yang Metal Industrial Co. Ltd, Taipei Hsien, Taiwan,
- Tai Yang Metal Industrial Co. Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan,
- Young Shieng Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Taipei, Taiwan,
- Livnica Zeljeza i Tempera, Kikinda, Yugoslavia,
- Titan, Kamnik, Yugoslavia,
- Awaji Sangyo K.K., Tokyo, Japan,
- Higashio Pipe Fittings MFG, Co. Ltd, Kawachi Nagano, Osaka, Japan,
- Hitachi Metals Ltd, Chiyoda-Ku, Tokyo, Japan,
- Nippon Kokan Pipe Fittings MFG, Co. Ltd, Kishiwada, Osaka, Japan,
- Yodoshi Malleable Co. Ltd, Kawachi Nagano, Osaka, Japan;
(c) EEC importers:
- Hermann Schmidt, Essen-Bredeney, Germany,
- Tupy Handelsgesellschaft mbH., Hamburg, Germany,
- Euraccordi, Liscate, Milano, Italy,
- Jannone Arm SpA., Napoli, Italy,
- Rocco Locatelli s.a.s., Casteggio, Pavia, and Milano, Italy
- O.M.L., Legnaro, Padova, Italy.
(5) The investigation of dumping and price undercutting covered the period 1 January to 31 December 1984.
B. DUMPING
Normal value
(6) Normal value was in all cases provisionally determined on the basis of the net ex-works domestic prices of those producers who exported to the Community and who provided sufficient evidence concerning the prices actually paid in the ordinary course of trade for the like product intended for consumption in the exporting country and which were considered to be representative for the domestic market concerned. Account was taken, where appropriate, of packing, transport costs within the country and payment terms to arrive at the net ex-works price.
Export price
(7) The export prices were generally determined on the basis of the net ex-works prices actually paid for the products sold for export to the Community. Account was taken, where appropriate, of packing, ocean freight, transport within the country, port charges, and commissions.
(8) Where exports were made to subsidiary companies in the Community export prices were constructed on the basis of the prices at which the imported product was first resold to an independent buyer, suitably adjusted to take account of all costs incurred between importation and resale including customs duty, and of a profit margin of 4,0 % considered reasonable by analogy with the average profit margins of independent importers of the product in question.
C. COMPARISON
(9) In order to make a fair comparison between the normal value and export prices, appropriate account was taken of the differences affecting price comparability, such as differences in the terms and conditions of sale and indirect taxes where it could be demonstrated that there was a direct relationship between such differences and the sales in question. Certain claims which were made by some exporters with regard to adjustments for differences in overheads have been rejected.
(10) All comparisons were made at the ex-factory level.
D. MARGINS
(11) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of the imports of the products in question originating in Yugoslavia, Japan and Brazil, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the export prices to the Community. These margins vary according to the exporter and the importing Member State, the weighted average margins being as follows:
- Yugoslavia: up to 71,3 %;
- Japan: up to 19,8 %;
- Brazil: 5,6 %;
- Taiwan: less than 1 %.
E. INJURY
(12) With regard to the allegation of injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Japan went down from 9 300 tonnes in 1981 to 6 400 tonnes in 1984 with a corresponding fall of market share from 17,8 % to 10,2 %. In addition, imports from Taiwan fell from 3 900 tonnes in 1981 to 1 100 tonnes in 1984, reducing their market share from 7,4 % to 1,7 %. Imports from Yugoslavia increased slightly during the same period from 1 800 to 1 900 tonnes while the market share dropped from 3,4 % to 3,0 % due to a rise in consumption. Only imports from Brazil have significantly expanded from 1 500 tonnes in 1981 to 4 200 tonnes in 1984 increasing their market share from 2,8 % to 6,4 %.
(13) Taken together the imports of tube and pipe fittings of malleable cast iron originating in Japan, Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Brazil declined from 16 400 tonnes in 1981 to 13 600 tonnes in 1984 with a consequent decrease in market share from 31,4 % to 21,6 %.
(14) Considering that the imports of the Japanese and Taiwanese product in the Community had decreased and corresponded to a declining market share of these products in the Community, the Commission has examined whether it was appropriate to aggregate the imports of tube and pipe fittings originating in Japan and Taiwan with those originating in Yugoslavia and Brazil.
The Commission found that all the products under investigation competed with each other in the Community market. Furthermore, Japanese and Taiwanese imports taken together despite their decline still maintained a substantial market share significant enough to cause material injury because of the low prices at which they were sold in the Community. The Commission therefore concluded that in order to determine whether material injury was caused by the dumped products aggregation of the imports from Japan and Taiwan with those from Yugoslavia and Brazil was not unreasonable.
(15) With regard to sales prices of the dumped product in the Community it was found that the exporters concerned sold their product through different sales channels in the Community and that the imported products were thus competing with the products of the Community industry at different marketing stages. On the basis of direct sales to large distributors and wholesalers in the Community, prices of Community producers were undercut in a range from 25 % to 45 %; in view of the substantial price differential certain Community producers had to suspend supplies to those distributors buying the dumped product, others were forced to scale down their prices below production cost in order to meet the competition from the imported product and to continue sales to these distributors thus suffering considerable financial losses. Where the Community producers competed with the importing distributors no significant and systematic price undercutting was found; however, the resale prices of the imported product prevented Community producers from raising their prices to a level necessary to cover cost increases which reduced their profit margins on their sales or in certain cases even induced losses.
On the basis of their total sales of tube and pipe fittings all major Community producers have continuously suffered losses from 1981 to 1984.
(16) Community production has increased from 35 500 tonnes in 1981 to 42 500 tonnes in 1984 that is by about 20 %. The increase in production improved capacity utilization considerably, from 65 % to 80 % on average; certain production lines were temporarily running at full capacity.
(17) Sales of Community producers increased in line with production and their market share recovered from 43 % in 1981 to 50 % in 1984.
(18) In the light of the significant improvement of production, capacity utilization and sales of the Community industry the Commission has considered whether injury might have been caused by price suppression in the Community due to the imported products. In fact Community producers were only able to regain market share by keeping their prices at a level not permitting to cover full costs. Such a defensive strategy relying on prices which do not cover full cost and a reasonable profit but are merely a contribution to fixed costs jeopardizes in the longer run the viability of the enterprise and constitutes material injury if caused by low-priced dumped imports.
(19) In this context the Commission had to consider the effects of other factors such as a decrease of consumption in the Community or imports from third countries not concerned by the procedure or from Taiwan for which de minimis dumping was found. Consumption in the Community has risen by some 20 % from 1981 to 1984. Imports from other countries not concerned by the procedure also increased from 13 000 tonnes in 1981 to 17 800 tonnes in 1984 corresponding to a growth in market share from 25 % to 28 %. At the same time imports originating in the countries concerned by the procedure fell from 16 400 tonnes to 13 600 tonnes corresponding to a decrease in market share of 9,8 %. The evidence available to the Commission shows that the prices of the imported products both from the countries concerned by the proceeding and other third countries were approximately at the same level for sales through comparable sales channels.
Taking into account that the market share of the countries concerned has substantially decreased while at the same time the market share of other third countries continued to rise, and in particular that the sales prices of goods from the third countries were at approximately the same level as those from the countries concerned the Commission is of the opinion that the injury caused to the Community industry by price undercutting or price suppression cannot be attributed solely to the imports concerned by the proceeding.
(20) With regard to imports of the product concerned originating in Taiwan the dumping margins are de minimis and protective measures should not be envisaged against these imports. (21) As far as the imports of the product in question originating in Japan, Brazil and Yugoslavia are concerned protective measures in respect of imports from these countries alone would not eliminate the injury caused to the Community industry, consideration being given to the higher market share reached by imports from other third countries during the investigation period and their equally low prices. Protective measure against imports from Japan, Brazil and Yugoslavia would be likely to favour mainly other low-priced imports and increase their market share further at the expense of imports from these countries without any consequent improvement in the situation for the Community industry. Furthermore the exporters concerned have agreed to report to the Commission on a regular basis on quantities and prices of their exports of tube and pipe fittings to the Community. Under these circumstances and taking account of the volume decline of the imports concerned and the improved situation of the Community industry with regard to its sales, production and capacity utilization, the Commission has reached the conclusion that protective measures would not be in the Community's interest.
G. TERMINATION
(22) The proceeding concerning imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of malleable cast iron originating in Japan, Brazil, Yugoslavia and Taiwan should therefore be terminated.
No objection to this course of action was raised in the Advisory Committee.
(23) The complainant was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate this proceeding. Subsequently, the complainant requested additional information and a hearing which was granted. The arguments made at the hearing had been taken into account in this Decision,","{'title': '86/536/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 November 1986 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain tube and pipe fittings originating in Brazil, Taiwan, Yugoslavia and Japan'}"

Whereas:
(1) The animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from Colombia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil, Chile and Argentina are laid down by Commission Decision 93/402/EEC(3), as last amended by Decision 2001/276/EC(4).
(2) Imports have been suspended from Argentina by Decision 2001/276/EC until 15 April 2001 as a precautionary measure until more detailed information can be obtained following changes in the health situation in Argentina and the suspension by Argentina of their exports of fresh meat to Canada, Chile and the USA.
(3) Following this decision the competent authority of Argentina itself suspended exports to the Community of fresh meat from species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, introduced a reorganisation of the veterinary services and a completely new strategic plan including regionalisation to control foot-and-mouth is being developed. At least until these changes can be properly evaluated it is necessary to prolong this suspension.
(4) The suspension of imports from Argentina was implemented through the replacement by Decision 2001/276/EC of the Annexes to Decision 93/402/EEC; for the sake of legal certainty it shall be necessary to adopt a new measure updating fully these Annexes and therefore it is not appropriate to limit in the meantime the validity of the current Annexes excluding Argentina. However the decision to suspend imports of meat from Argentina will be reviewed within 2 months of its notification.
(5) Argentina stopped certifying consignments from 13 March 2001 and for the sake of legal certainty consignments produced and certified on or prior to this date should be accepted.
(6) Decision 2001/276/EC should be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1617/1999(2), and in particular Article 4 and Article 5(3) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),
Whereas:
(1) By virtue of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each Member State is required to produce a harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) starting with the index for January 1997.
(2) It is particularly important to secure a high degree of credibility of the HICP which may be supported by the objective of limiting in a given context the number of HICP revisions to the minimum extent necessary.
(3) It is generally accepted that the annual average, annual and monthly rates of change of the HICPs are important for the measurement of inflation, more particularly for assessing price convergence and informing the monetary policy of the European Central Bank.
(4) Changes in the system of national or harmonised rules constitute valid reasons for revisions to the HICPs to the extent that they ensure or improve the comparability, reliability, or relevance of the HICPs; changes in the system of harmonised rules should not require revisions unless otherwise stated in the context of particular implementing measures.
(5) Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2602/2000 of 17 November 2000 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for the treatment of price reductions in the harmonised index of consumer prices(4) needs to be amended accordingly.
(6) Revisions due to mistakes, or because of new or improved basic information are valid reasons for revisions to HICPs because they improve the comparability, reliability, or relevance of the HICPs.
(7) There is considerable scope for procedural differences between Member States on the revision of index series. A set of harmonised rules is necessary to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability requirement of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as well as their reliability and relevance.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(5),","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1921/2001 of 28 September 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for revisions of the harmonised index of consumer prices and amending Regulation (EC) No 2602/2000 (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAim\n\nThe aim of this Regulation is to provide information on significant effects of implementing measures under Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 and to establish harmonised rules concerning revisions to the HICP that are consistent with those measures, and sufficient to ensure their comparability, reliability, and relevance.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(a) a ""revision"" is an ex-post change in a HICP series, index level, rate of change or weight, that has been made publicly available through printed or electronic media by the Commission (Eurostat) affecting the results to one decimal place;\n\n(b) a ""mistake"" is an unintentional breach of an established rule affecting at least one HICP series;\n\n(c) a ""provisional"" result is a result which is, subject to revision, expected to be finalised in a later month.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nRevisability\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 97/132/EC of 17 December 1996 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex V to the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (‘the Agreement’) recognises the sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand. Depending on the equivalence or non-equivalence of those measures with those required by the Community, Annex VII of the Agreement provides that appropriate official health certificates should be used in the trade of fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products with New Zealand.
(2) Commission Decision 2003/56/EC (2) lays down the certification requirements and provides models for official health certificates to be used for the importation from New Zealand of live animals and animal products. In cases where full equivalence of sanitary measures has been determined, simplified certificates may be used, models for which are set out in Annexes II to V to that Decision.
(3) Account should be taken of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (3), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 650/2003 (4), and of recent acknowledgements of equivalence of sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products, fishery products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand.
(4) Decision 2003/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.11.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 346/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 October 2004\namending Decision 2003/56/EC on health certificates for the importation of live animals and animal products from New Zealand\n(notified under document number C(2004) 4028)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2004/784/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex V to the Agreement between the European Community and New Zealand on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (‘the Agreement’) recognises the sanitary measures for fresh meat, meat products and certain other animal products traded with New Zealand.

Energy savings\n\nThe applicance must have an energy efficiency index lower than 42 % as defined in Directive 94/2/EC(1), Annex V, using the same test method EN 153 and the same classification in 10 categories.\n\nThe applicant shall provide a copy of the technical documentation referred to under Article 2(1) of Commission Directive 94/2/EC. This documentation shall include the reports of at least three measurements of energy consumption made according to EN 153. The arithmetic mean of these measurements shall be less or equal to the above requirement. The value declared on the energy label shall not be lower than this mean value, and the energy efficiency class indicated on the energy label shall correspond to this mean value.\n\nIn case of verification, which is not required on application, competent bodies shall apply the tolerances and control procedures laid down in EN 153.\n\n2.

(1) By Decision 2012/735/EU, the Council authorised the signing, on behalf of the Union, of the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other part (‘the Agreement’). Pursuant to Decision 2012/735/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion. The Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 March 2013.
(2) Subsection 2 of Section B of Appendix 1 to Annex I to the Agreement concerns the tariff elimination schedule of the EU party for goods originating in Peru. For a number of specific products, it provides for the application of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to open tariff quotas for such products.
(3) The tariff quotas should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (2).
(4) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of origin to the customs authorities, as provided for in the Agreement.
(5) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (3), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 927/2012 (4), contains new CN codes which are different from those referred to in the Agreement. The new codes should therefore be reflected in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since the Agreement takes effect on 1 March 2013, this Regulation should apply from the same date.

For a number of specific products, it provides for the application of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to open tariff quotas for such products.\n\n((3)) The tariff quotas should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No\xa02913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2).\n\n((4)) Entitlement to benefit from the tariff concessions should be subject to the presentation of the relevant proof of origin to the customs authorities, as provided for in the Agreement.\n\n((5)) Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff(3), as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 927/2012(4), contains new CN codes which are different from those referred to in the Agreement. The new codes should therefore be reflected in the Annex to this Regulation.\n\n((6)) Since the Agreement takes effect on 1 March 2013, this Regulation should apply from the same date.\n\n((7)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nUnion tariff quotas are opened for the goods originating in Peru and listed in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe customs duties applicable to imports into the Union of goods originating in Peru and listed in the Annex shall, within the respective tariff quota set out in the Annex to this Regulation, be suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThe tariff quotas in the Annex shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with Articles 308a to 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 March 2013.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nNotwithstanding the rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature, the wording of the description of the products is to be considered as having no more than an indicative value, the scope of the preferential scheme being determined, within the context of this Annex, by CN codes as they exist at the time of adoption of this Regulation.\nOrder No\nCN code\nDescription of goods\nQuota period\nAnnual quota volume\n(in tonnes net weight if not otherwise specified)\n09.7210\n0201\n0202\n0206\xa010\xa095\n0206\xa029\xa091\n0210\xa020\n0210\xa099\xa051\n0210\xa099\xa090\n1602\xa050\xa010\n1602\xa090\xa061\nMeat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen\nFrom 1.3.2013 to 31.12.2013\n1\xa0792\n(\n1\n)\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12.\n2\xa0365\n(\n1\n)\n,\n(\n2\n)\n09.7211\n0403\xa090\nButtermilk, curdled milk and cream, kephir and other fermented or acidified milk and cream, whether or not concentrated or containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured or containing added fruit, nuts or cocoa\nFrom 1.3.2013 to 31.12.2013\n1\xa0584\nFrom 1.1. to 31.12.2014 and for each period thereafter from 1.1. to 31.12.\n2\xa0090\n(\n3\n)\n09.7212\n0405\nButter and other fats and oils derived from milk;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 22 October 2004, Monsanto Europe SA, submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xNK603 maize (the application).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of MON863xNK603 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with the provision of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 31 March 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xNK603 maize as described in the application (the products) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment (3). In its opinion, EFSA concluded that it was acceptable to use the data for the single events in support of the safety of the products and considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(4) In October 2006, upon request of the Commission, EFSA published detailed clarifications on how the comments of the competent authorities of the Member States had been taken into account in its opinion and also published further information on the different elements considered by the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of EFSA.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(6) On 26 February 2007, in the light of a report published by the World Health Organisation listing kanamycin and neomycin as ‘critically important antibacterial agents for human medicine and for risk management strategies of non-human use’, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement highlighting the therapeutic relevance of both antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. On 13 April 2007, taking into account this statement, EFSA indicated that the therapeutic effect of the antibiotics at stake will not be compromised by the presence of the nptII gene in GM plants. This is due to the extremely low probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria and its subsequent expression and to the fact that this antibiotic resistant gene in bacteria is already widespread in the environment. It thus confirmed its previous assessment of the safe use of the antibiotic resistance marker gene nptII in genetically modified organisms and their derived products for food and feed uses.
(7) On 14 May 2008, the Commission sent a mandate to EFSA, with a request: (i) to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion taking into account the previous opinion and the statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market and their possible uses for import and processing and for cultivation; (ii) to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing ARM genes. The mandate brought to the attention of EFSA, inter alia, letters by the Commission from Denmark and Greenpeace.
(8) On 11 June 2009, EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes that the previous assessment of EFSA on MON863xNK603 maize is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement, and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion.
(9) On 15 March 2007, following a scientific publication regarding a reanalysis of the MON 863 90-day rat study and questioning the safety of MON 863 maize, the Commission consulted EFSA on what impact this analysis study might have on its earlier opinion on MON 863 maize. On 28 June 2007, EFSA indicated that the publication does not raise new issues which are toxicologically relevant and confirmed its earlier favourable safety assessment on MON 863 maize.
(10) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(11) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(12) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xNK603 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(13) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(14) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs.
(15) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (6).
(16) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman.
(17) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,","{'header': '5.3.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 55/78', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 2 March 2010\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize MON863xNK603 (MON-ØØ863-5xMON-ØØ6Ø3-6) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2010) 1203)\n(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/141/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 22 October 2004, Monsanto Europe SA, submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xNK603 maize (the application).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of MON863xNK603 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation.

Whereas Article 18a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2142/70 provides that reference prices for carp may be fixed before the beginning of each marketing year ; whereas these prices may be fixed at different levels for periods to be specified within each marketing year according to seasonal fluctuations in prices;
Whereas Article 18a (2) provides that reference prices shall be fixed on the basis of the average of the production prices recorded in representative Community production zones, during the three years preceding the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a product defined by its commercial characteristics ; whereas the terms ""carp"", ""representative production zone"" and ""production price"" should be defined for the purposes of this Regulation;
Whereas only live carp weighing not less than 800 grammes are of commercial significance ; whereas Article 18a as aforesaid should therefore be limited to such products;
Whereas carp breeding in the Community is very dispersed ; whereas on this account an area representing 15 % of Community production should be regarded as a representative production zone;
Whereas production prices in representative production zones differ within each marketing year;
whereas from 16 November these prices tend to fall, and whereas the marketing year should therefore be subdivided accordingly;
Whereas paragraph 3 of the aforesaid provides for the fixing of a compensatory tax if the free-at-frontier price of a normal commercial quantity of carp coming from a specified place is lower than the reference price ; whereas a quantity of at least 1 000 kg of carp may be considered a normal commercial quantity;
Whereas, in order that free-at-frontier prices may be determined as accurately as possible, the information to be taken into consideration must be specified ; whereas this means, apart from the prices shown in customs and trade documents, any information concerning prices applied by third countries;

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) In February 1995, the Commission received a complaint from three companies, Hoechst-Diafoil GmbH, Rhône-Poulenc Films and Teijin-DuPont Films, concerning imports of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea. The three complainants allegedly represented 100 % of total PET video film output in the Community. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4), the initiation of an antidumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea.
(2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned; the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
II. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(3) The complaining Community producers formally withdrew their complaint concerning imports of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea. The Commission considered that a termination of the proceeding would not be against the interest of the Community.
(4) Consequently, the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea should be terminated without adoption of protective measures.
(5) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.
(6) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding and have been given the opportunity to comment,",{'title': '96/437/EC: Commission Decision of 18 July 1996 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of PET video film originating in the Republic of Korea'}

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) (basic Regulation), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Measures in force
(1) In March 1998, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 495/98(2), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in the People's Republic of China (the PRC) and amended the measures in force against Ukraine pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2413/95(3). The duties took the form of a specific duty.
2. Initiation
(2) On 13 June 2002, the Commission announced by a notice (Notice of Initiation) published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(4) the initiation of a partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of ferro-silico-manganese originating in the PRC and Ukraine.
(3) The review was initiated on an initiative of the Commission in order to examine the appropriateness of the measures in force. The current measure, namely a duty in the form of a specific duty, does not cater for situations in which imported goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation.
3. Investigation
(4) The Commission officially advised exporting producers, the importers and the users known to be concerned and their associations, the representatives of the exporting countries concerned and the Community producers of the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of Initiation.
(5) A number of exporting producers in the countries concerned, as well as Community producers and Community importers/traders made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the abovementioned time limit and who demonstrated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be heard.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of the appropriateness of the measures in force.
B. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(7) Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5) envisages, for the determination of the customs value, an apportioning of the price actually paid or payable in situations where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation.
(8) In order to avoid an excessive amount of anti-dumping duty being levied, the specific duty should, in case of damaged goods, be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 29(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that, during the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years and in order to ensure adequate supply to Community refineries, import duties on a complementary quantity of imports of raw cane-sugar originating in the States referred to in Annex VI to that Regulation are to be suspended.
(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of products of the sugar sector under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2), on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance of raw sugar. For the 2006/2007 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met.
(3) To ensure that refineries within the Community have a sufficient supply of raw sugar to fulfil their traditional supply needs, the complementary quantity should be allocated between the third countries concerned in a way to ensure full delivery. For India, it is considered appropriate to maintain an annual quantity of 10 000 tonnes, extrapolated to 12 500 tonnes to take into account the 15-month period of the 2006/2007 marketing year.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (hereafter referred to as 'the basic Regulation`), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2), and in particular Article 11(8) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Considering the following:
A. ORIGINAL MEASURES
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2305/92 (3) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil. The specific rate of duty applied to importations of the product when produced by Companhia Brasileira Carboreto de Calcio (hereafter 'CBCC`) was set at 18,3 %.
(2) On 14 August 1996 CBCC submitted a request for an interim review (hereafter referred to as 'the review`) which was initiated on 7 January 1997 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4).
(3) Following the publication in February 1997 of a notice of impending expiry of the measures in force (5) and the receipt in May 1997 of a complaint lodged by the Liaison Committee of the ferro-alloy industry (hereafter referred to as 'EuroAlliages`), the Commission announced the initiation of an expiry review by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6).
(4) Following the withdrawal by EuroAlliages of their request for an expiry review, both reviews were concluded by Commission Decision 98/164/EC (7) which terminated the proceeding and hence repealed the duty for CBCC. The above Decision concluded that there had been no dumping of the product by CBCC during the investigation period of the interim review, that is from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996.
B. APPLICATION FOR REFUND
(5) On 18 September 1996, 1 October 1996, 13 February 1997, 22 May 1997, 3 June 1997, 20 August 1997, 3 September 1997, 18 November 1997, 4, 15 and 22 December 1997, 20 January 1998, 9 February 1998 and 24 March 1998 Ecumet (UK) Ltd. (hereafter referred to as 'the applicant`), an independent customer of CBCC, submitted applications for the refund of NLG [. . .] (8) and GBP [. . .] (289 transactions in total) on imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil and released for free circulation in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The goods were sold for export to the Community by CBCC between 30 July 1995 and 23 January 1998.
(6) On 21 November 1997, the applicant partially withdrew one application in respect of 8 transactions totalling GBP [. . .].
Following this withdrawal, the total amounts for which refunds are claimed are NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .], (281 transactions in total).
C. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT
(7) The applicant claims that the dumping margin in respect of the silicon metal exported by CBCC and released into free circulation in the Community in the period January 1996 to February 1998 was significantly lower than the applicable duty rate of 18,3 %, which he paid for his imports.
D. ADMISSIBILITY
(8) The applications are inadmissible in respect of Five transactions for an amount of NLG [. . .] and 11 transactions for GBP [. . .] of anti-dumping duties because the time-limit of six months prescribed by the basic Regulation between the determination of duties to be levied and the submission of the applications for refund was not respected with regard to those transactions.
(9) All of the applications submitted for the remaining claims of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] (265 transactions in total) correspond to definitive anti-dumping duties paid and were introduced within the time limits established in Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation.
E. MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS
1. Evidence
(10) In accordance with the relevant provisions of Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation, the applicant submitted in respect of the applications referred to in recital (9) of this Decision the necessary prima facie evidence relating to normal value and export prices showing that the duty collected exceeds the dumping margin calculated for the appropriate reference periods.
(11) In particular, the Commission sought and verified all the information it considered necessary within the framework of this investigation and of the review investigation (see below). Verification visits were also made to the premises of CBCC within the framework of the review investigation.
(12) The applications dependent on the findings of the review should be considered to be duly substantiated by evidence within the meaning of the Fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the basic Regulation, which sets the time-limits for completing refund investigations, from the date on which the findings of the review were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, that is 27 February 1998.
(13) The remaining applications which were dealt with in the framework of the refund investigation should be considered to have been duly supported by evidence from the date on which the Commission's services were in receipt of all data necessary for the investigation, that is 6 August 1998.
(14) The Commission, in pursuing this investigation, applied the same methodology as that used in the original investigation as required by Article 11(9) of the basic Regulation.
2. Reference periods
(15) The dumping margin of the exporter CBCC was calculated for the following three reference periods: from 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995, from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996 and from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997.
3. Merits of the transactions sold for export between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 1996
The applications in respect of 105 transactions on which anti-dumping duties of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] were paid relate to invoices issued within the investigation period select for the review, that is from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996.
The Commission considers that the information and findings of the review, which determined that there was no dumping of the product concerned by CBCC for the period 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996, should be used to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified for the import transactions which were invoiced by CBCC between those dates.
4. Merits of the transactions sold for export between 1 July 1995 and 31 December 1995 and between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 1997
156 transactions relate to invoices issued by CBCC between 30 July 1995 and 31 December 1995 and between 17 January 1997 and 27 December 1997 for total amounts of NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .] of anti-dumping duties.
As the transactions in question clearly fall outside the period of investigation used for the review of the measures and thus the conclusions of the review could not be applied to those transactions, the Commission services carried out an investigation to determine whether and to what extent a refund was justified.
To that end, the dumping margin of CBCC was calculated for the periods of 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995 and 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997.
(a) Normal value
It was found that CBCC's domestic sales volume exceeded 5 % of its export sales to the Community, in accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation.
It was also established that the silicon metal sold on the Brazilian market was comparable to the silicon metal exported from Brazil to the Community.
In order to assess if and to what extent domestic sales were made in the ordinary course of trade, the unit value of each domestic transaction was compared with the cost of production per tonne reported by the company during the reference periods. It was found that the volume of sales made at prices equal to or above the cost of production were between 10 % and 80 % of the total domestic sales volume. Normal value was, therefore, established on the basis of the average domestic sales price of these sales only.
(b) Export prices
Export price was established by reference to the price actually paid for the silicon metal sold for export to independent buyers in the Community, in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation.
(c) Comparison
Normal value was compared at an ex-factory level with the export price on a weighted average basis and at the same level of trade. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences affecting price comparability, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation.
(d) Establishment of the dumping margin
The refund investigation was concluded with a finding of no dumping by CBCC of the product concerned during the relevant periods of 1 July 1995 to 31 December 1995 and 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997.
5. Merits of the transactions sold for export in January 1998
Following the selection of the reference period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997, two applications related to invoices issued by CBCC on 23 January 1998 for an amount of NLG [. . .] and one of GBP [. . .] were lodged.
The Commission considers that the finding of no dumping for the reference period of 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1997 can be reasonably applied to these transactions. In particular, the Commission considers that these transactions took place immediately after the period examined, that the amount concerned is very small in proportion to the total volume of exports to the Community by CBCC during the reference periods and to the total amount claimed by the applicant and that a stable pattern of no dumping was consistently found for the transactions made for the two and half years preceding these transactions. Furthermore it was established that the average FOB export price decreased by less than 0,25 % and the domestic transactions were found, on average, to be both profitable and at prices consistently lower than the export prices.
F. DISCLOSURE
(16) The applicant received disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to adopt a Commission Decision concerning the refund application in question. The applicant made no comments.
G. AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED
(17) As the review and refund investigations established that there was no dumping for the product concerned when exported by CBCC in the three reference periods, and the Commission also considers that the finding of no dumping can be applied to the transactions invoiced in January 1998 as a result of the comparison with the rate of duty applied the applicant should be refunded NLG [. . .] and GBP [. . .],","{'title': '1999/219/EC: Commission Decision of 11 March 1999 concerning an application submitted by Ecumet (UK) Ltd for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of silicon metal originating in Brazil (notified under document number C(1999) 559) (Only the English and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) It is appropriate from a technical point of view to exempt waste facilities containing only inert waste or unpolluted soil from the assessment of the criteria concerning the presence of dangerous substances or hazardous waste.
(3) The potential hazard posed by a waste facility may change significantly during the operational and closure phases of the facility. Therefore, it is appropriate to review the classification of the facility as necessary and at least at the end of the operational phase.
(4) In order to assess the potential for loss of life and danger for human health in cases of loss of structural integrity, or incorrect operation, of a facility, the actual permanent presence of people in the potentially affected areas should be taken into account when assessing the significance of that potential loss of life or danger for human health.

Democratic principles and the rule of law, on which the ACP-EC partnership is founded, are essential elements of the Agreement and thus form the cornerstone of our relations.\n\nBy letter of 31 January 2001, the Union expressed its regret that no satisfactory solution to remedy the violation of the Haitian electoral law had been found. It informed you of the appropriate measures taken as foreseen in Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. In its letters of 23 January 2002 and 24 January 2003, the Union reviewed its decision of 29 January 2001 in order to allow the cooperation instruments affected by these measures to be gradually reactivated subject to the achievement of objectives as regards the electoral process.\n\nToday, after almost three years of political crisis, the Union considers that democratic principles are still not upheld in Haiti. Nevertheless, the Union recognizes that numerous international and local efforts are contributing towards the search for a solution to this crisis, and in particular those of the Organisation of American States (OAS) and of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and it reaffirms its wish to support these efforts. Accordingly, within the framework of OAS Resolution No 822, the Government of Haiti has committed itself to giving increased priority to the restoration of a climate of security and of confidence in the country, including the completion of inquiries into all politically motivated crimes and the strengthening of the disarmament programmes. The European Union continues strongly to urge the Government rapidly to translate this commitment into concrete actions and to undertake all the steps enshrined in OAS resolution 822 leading to free and fair national and local elections. Furthermore, the European Union is gravely concerned by the continuing deterioration in the socioeconomic situation in Haiti and reaffirms its intent to continue cooperation for the direct benefit of the Haitian people.\n\nIn the light of these elements, the Council of the European Union reviewed its decision of 10 January 2003 and decided to review the appropriate measures referred to in Article 96(2)(c) of the Agreement as follows:\n\n(a) The re-direction of the remaining funds under the eighth European Development Fund (EDF) to programmes that are of direct benefit to the Haitian people, to strengthen civil society and the private sector, and to support democratisation, the strengthening of the rule of law and the electoral process, will be continued;\n\n(b) Decisions on the notification of the 9th EDF allocation, programming and signature of the relevant National Indicative Programme will be taken on the basis of the implementation of OAS resolution 822 and in particular the stipulations regarding the legislative and local elections process including the formation of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP-Conseil Electoral Provisoire) the formation by the CEP of the Electoral Guarantees Commission and the holding of national elections.\n\nNoting the call by the OAS in its resolution 822 for the normalization of cooperation and the donors' meeting held in Washington in December 2003, the European Union was represented at that meeting and participated in the review of the situation in Haiti. In this overall context it is considered that regional programmes from the Caribbean Regional Indicative Programme, which involve direct benefit to the Haitian people and whose benefits are shared by other countries, are not affected by the above measures. Trade Cooperation and trade-related preferences are not affected by these measures.\n\nThe Union will follow closely further developments in the democratisation process, in particular the achievement of the steps towards national and local elections. The Union is ready to review its Decision if there are encouraging developments. It reiterates its readiness to engage in enhanced political dialogue.\n\nPlease accept, Sir, the assurance of our highest consideration.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFor the Council""}]}"

concluding the partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of the anti-dumping duty on imports of certain graphite electrode systems originating in India
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 9 and 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) Following an investigation (‘the original investigation’), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1629/2004 (2) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain graphite electrode systems originating in India.
1.1.   Initiation of an interim review
(2) On the request of Hindustan Electro Graphite Limited (‘HEG’ or ‘the company’), an Indian exporting producer subject to the anti-dumping measures in force, a partial interim review of the above-mentioned Regulation was initiated pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation.
(3) This partial interim review was initiated based on prima facie evidence provided by the company that, as far as they were concerned, the circumstances on the basis of which measures were established had changed and that these changes were of a lasting nature.
(4) The request alleged that the cost of production of the product concerned had reduced due to production efficiencies since the original investigation, and that the company had been able to significantly increase their export prices. They claimed therefore that the continued imposition of measures at the existing level, which were based on the level of dumping previously established, was no longer necessary to offset dumping.
(5) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission published a notice (‘Notice of Initiation’) (3) and commenced an investigation, limited in scope to the examination of dumping.
1.2.   Parties concerned by the investigation
(6) The Commission officially advised HEG, as well as the representatives of the exporting country and the Community industry, of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(7) The Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a reply within the deadlines set for that purpose. The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of HEG in Bhopal, India.
1.3.   Review investigation period
(8) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008 (‘the review investigation period’ or ‘RIP’).
2.   PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT
2.1.   Product concerned
(9) The product concerned by the current review is the same as that in the original investigation, i.e. graphite electrodes of a kind used for electric furnaces, with an apparent density of 1.65 g/cm3 or more and an electrical resistance of 6.0 μΩ.m or less, falling within CN code ex 8545 11 00 and nipples used for such electrodes, falling within CN code ex 8545 90 90 whether imported together or separately, originating in India.
2.2.   Like product
(10) The current review has shown that the graphite electrode systems produced by HEG and sold on the Indian domestic market are similar to those exported to the Community and therefore could be considered to be like product to the product concerned.
3.   DUMPING
3.1.   Normal value
(11) In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation, the Commission first examined whether the domestic sales of the product concerned to independent customers were representative, i.e. whether the total volume of such sales was equal to or greater than 5 % of the total volume of the corresponding export sales to the Community. The domestic sales of HEG were found to be representative during the investigation period.
(12) The Commission then identified those product types sold domestically by that company which were identical or directly comparable with the types sold for export to the Community.
(13) Domestic sales of a particular product type were considered as sufficiently representative when the volume of that product type sold on the domestic market to independent customers during the investigation period represented 5 % or more of the total volume of the comparable product type sold for export to the Community.
(14) The Commission then examined whether the domestic sales of each type of graphite electrode system sold domestically in representative quantities could be considered as being made in the ordinary course of trade pursuant to Article 2(4) of the basic Regulation. This was done by establishing the proportion of profitable domestic sales to independent customers, of each exported product type, on the domestic market during the investigation period.
(15) For those domestic sales of each type of graphite electrode system sold domestically in representative quantities where the sales were over 80 % profitable by volume, normal value was therefore based on the actual domestic price of all transactions during the investigation period.
(16) For all other exported types also sold on the domestic market, where the sales were less than 80 % profitable by volume, normal value was based on the domestic sales price of the profitable transactions during the investigation period.
(17) Wherever domestic prices of a particular product type could not be used in order to establish normal value, another method had to be applied. In accordance with Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation the Commission instead calculated a constructed normal value, as follows.
(18) Normal value was constructed by adding to the exporter’s manufacturing costs of the exported types, a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative expenses (‘SG&A expenses’) and a reasonable margin of profit.
(19) In all cases SG&A expenses and profit were established pursuant to the methods set out in Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. To this end, the Commission examined whether the SG&A expenses incurred and the profit realised by the exporting producer on sales on the domestic market of the like product constituted reliable data and in this case determined that it was suitable to be used to construct normal value.
3.2.   Export price
(20) All export sales of the product concerned by HEG were made directly to independent customers in the Community, and therefore the export price was established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product concerned in the RIP in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation.
3.3.   Comparison
(21) The comparison between the normal value and the export price was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. On this basis, allowances, where applicable and justified, were made for differences in rebates, transport costs, insurance, handling charges, packaging, credit costs and import duties.
3.4.   Dumping margin
(22) As provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average normal value by type was compared with the weighted average export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned.
(23) HEG’s dumping margin expressed as a percentage of the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, duty unpaid, was found to be de minimis in the sense of Article 9(3) of the basic Regulation.
4.   LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES
(24) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature.
(25) Whereas the cost of production of the company had not significantly decreased since the original investigation, the export price of the product concerned had increased substantially during the RIP, thereby removing the dumping findings of the original investigation.
(26) Latest available data collected for the period after the RIP showed the import prices from HEG to have remained both high and stable, thereby confirming that the company continued with its non-dumping behaviour after the RIP.
(27) It was also found that, during the RIP, exports by HEG to markets other than the EU were made at prices above prices on the Indian domestic market.
(28) In these circumstances, the findings from the RIP can be considered to be lasting.
5.   ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
(29) As stated above, HEG was found to be dumping at a de minimis level during the RIP. It is however noted that, while the dumping margin established for the company concerned in the original investigation was 22,4 %, the anti-dumping duty presently in force against this company is 0 % (4). This results from the fact that there are parallel countervailing duties in force on imports of the product concerned. In these circumstances, the finding of de minimis dumping has no immediate impact on the level of the measures currently in force (5).
6.   DISCLOSURE
(30) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts, considerations and findings of the investigation and were given an opportunity to comment.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2013/42/EU
of 22 July 2013
amending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, as regards a Quick Reaction Mechanism against VAT fraud
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) Tax fraud in the field of value added tax (VAT) leads to considerable budget losses and affects the conditions of competition and thus the operation of the internal market. Specific sudden and massive forms of tax fraud have recently developed especially via the use of electronic means which facilitate rapid illegitimate trade on a large scale.
(2) Council Directive 2006/112/EC (3) allows Member States to apply for a derogation from that Directive in order to prevent certain forms of tax evasion or avoidance.
(3) Recent experience has demonstrated that the procedure provided for in Article 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC is not able to respond quickly enough to requests by Member States for urgent measures.
(4) Experience has also shown that the designation of the recipient as the person liable for the payment of the VAT (reverse charge) is, in certain cases, an effective measure to stop VAT fraud in specific sectors.
(5) Under the reverse charge provisions in Articles 199 and 199a of Directive 2006/112/EC, Member States do not have the flexibility to respond quickly to sudden and massive fraud in categories of goods and services falling outside the scope of those Articles. Specific arrangements therefore need to be made to address these circumstances.
(6) Considering the massive instances of fraud that have occurred, a rapid and exceptional response to further instances of sudden fraud is best guaranteed by a Quick Reaction Mechanism (""QRM"") special measure consisting of the option to apply for a short period a reverse charge, following appropriate notification by the Member State concerned. In order to ensure the exercising of the option is proportionate to the problem, the Commission, once it is in possession of the relevant information, should have a short period in which to appraise the notification and confirm whether it objects to the QRM special measure. Member States should have the opportunity for their views to be taken into account by the Commission, and should therefore be fully informed of the notification and any additional information provided throughout the process. Additionally, the Council should then decide on any further application of the reverse charge by an implementing Decision pursuant to Article 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC.
(7) The Member State that has notified its intention to apply the QRM special measure may do so once the Commission has notified the absence of objection.
(8) In order to provide for the further application of the reverse charge, at the earliest opportunity and before the expiry of the QRM special measure, the procedure laid down in Article 395 of Directive 2006/112/EC should be subject to a shorter deadline.
(9) Rapid processing of Member States' notifications under the QRM will be facilitated if a standardised form is established for those notifications and for the provision of any additional information to the Commission. Implementing powers should therefore be conferred on the Commission as regards that standardised form.
(10) Since a QRM can only be a temporary solution pending longer term legislative solutions with a view to making the VAT system more resilient to instances of VAT fraud, the QRM should only apply for a limited period of time.
(11) In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the QRM, the Commission should prepare an overall assessment report on the impact of the mechanism in addressing instances of sudden and massive fraud.
(12) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to address sudden and massive fraud phenomena in the field of VAT which very often have an international dimension, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, as they are not in a position to individually counter the fraud circuits related to new forms of trade which involve several countries at the same time, and can therefore, by reason of ensuring a quicker and, as a result, a more adequate and effective response to these phenomena, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(13) Directive 2006/112/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '26.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 201/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2013/42/EU\nof 22 July 2013\namending Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax, as regards a Quick Reaction Mechanism against VAT fraud', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Tax fraud in the field of value added tax (VAT) leads to considerable budget losses and affects the conditions of competition and thus the operation of the internal market.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the markets in products processed from fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2201/90 (2), and in particular Article 6 (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2205/90 (4), and in particular Article 5 (3) thereof,
Whereas pursuant to Article 6 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 aid is to be granted per hectare of area wholly devoted to grape cultivation and harvested ; whereas in this connection it is reasonable to accept that any area entirely planted with vines for producing sultanas, currants or muscatel grapes, on which all normal cultivation and harvesting work is carried out is eligible for this aid ; whereas, however, in order to give the national authorities full scope for carrying out whatever checks are necessary it should be stipulated that the aid will not be paid until after the harvest period;
Whereas satisfactory operation of the aid scheme will require checks by the Member States to ensure that aid is granted only in regard to the areas in question and in respect of products as defined in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, for which no other aid under other Community schemes relating to production structure has been applied for, in particular under Council Regulation (EEC) No 797/85 of 12 March 1985 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2176/90 (6) ; whereas a system of declaration of areas cultivated and varieties grown must be used as a basis for these checks ; whereas, however, applications for aid accompanied by all necessary information may also be accepted;
Whereas provision should be made for the Member States' checks to cover a sufficiently representative number of aid applications and for penalties to be imposed where irregularities are found;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 6 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, the maximum guaranteed area under grapes cultivated and harvested in the Community which, if exceeded, will entail a reduction in the aid for the following marketing year should be determined ; whereas the said maximum area takes account of the average area cultivated in the Community in the 1987/88, 1988/89 and 1989/90 marketing years;
Whereas, for the marketing year under way, the aid should be converted at the agricultural rate set for dried grapes ; whereas for conversion of the aid into national currency the operative event as defined in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 should be deemed to occur on the first day of the marketing year for which the aid is granted;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Article 42(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The third subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 (2) provides that all the payments made in anticipation by the Member States under their own responsibility prior to approval of the rural development programmes for the period 2007-2013 must be declared in the first declaration of expenditure following the adoption of the programmes. This rule is laid down for programmes not approved by 31 March 2007.
(2) Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 provides that the Community’s budget commitments for rural development programmes are to be made in annual instalments and that for each programme, the budget commitment for the first instalment is to follow the adoption of the programme by the Commission.
(3) Under the second subparagraph of Article 9(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3), appropriations which have not been used at the end of the financial year may be carried over, to the following financial year only, by means of a decision taken by the Commission by 15 February at the latest.
(4) Given this framework and the appropriations available for 2007, a large number of programmes will not be able to be approved until after the appropriations not used in that financial year have been carried over. As a result, for 2007, the first year of the programming period, it will not be possible for some of the payments made in anticipation by the Member States to be covered by a declaration of expenditure by the deadline of 31 January 2008 laid down in Article 16(2)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006.
(5) Therefore, in order to facilitate the financial management of the rural development programmes and in order not to prolong the deadline for reimbursing the expenditure incurred by the Member States, a new deadline should be laid down to enable the Member States, by derogation from the first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, to make an additional, special declaration of expenditure for the payments in anticipation made by them in 2007 under programmes approved by the Commission between the date of the Commission decision on the carry-over of appropriations from 2007 and 29 February 2008.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 of 23 July 2001 on the measures that may be taken by the Community following a report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body concerning anti-dumping and anti-subsidy matters (1), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission after having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Measures in force
(1) Following an anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of ironing boards originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’) and Ukraine (‘the first investigation’), anti-dumping measures were imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 of 23 April 2007 (2). That Regulation entered into force on 27 April 2007.
(2) It is recalled that the rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on ironing boards produced by the Chinese exporting producer Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co. Ltd (‘Since Hardware’) was 0 % while it ranged between 18,1 % and 38,1 % for other Chinese exporting producers. Following a subsequent interim review, these duty rates were increased to up to 42,3 % by Implementing Regulation of the Council (EU) No 270/2010 of 29 March 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 (3).
2.   Initiation of a new proceeding
(3) On 2 October 2009, the Commission announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (4) (‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-dumping investigation pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (5) (‘the basic Regulation’) concerning imports into the Union of ironing boards originating in the PRC, limited to Since Hardware. In the notice of initiation, the Commission also announced the initiation of a review pursuant to Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1515/2001 in order to allow for any necessary amendment of Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 in the light of the WTO Appellate Body report entitled ‘Mexico — Definitive Anti-dumping Measures on Beef and Rice’ (AB-2005-6) (6). This report stipulates in paragraphs 305 and 306 that an exporting producer not found to be dumping in an original investigation has to be excluded from the scope of the definitive measure imposed as a result of such investigation and cannot be made subject to administrative and changed circumstances reviews.
3.   Exclusion of Since Hardware from the definitive anti-dumping measure imposed by Regulation (EC) No 452/2007
(4) Since Hardware should be excluded from the definitive anti-dumping measure imposed by Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 in order not to make Since Hardware fall under two anti-dumping proceedings at the same time,","{'header': '22.12.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 338/8', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1241/2010\nof 20 December 2010\namending Regulation (EC) No 452/2007 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ironing boards originating, inter alia, in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 452/2007 is hereby amended as follows:\nIn Article 1(2), in the table, the entry concerning Since Hardware (Guangzhou) Co.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 47/2003(2), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 35(3),
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1176/2002(4), lays down the detailed rules of application for export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant exports, the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds, within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(6). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community export, it is appropriate to proceed by an open invitation to tender and to fix the indicative refund amount and the scheduled quantities for the period concerned.
(9) The Management Committee for fresh Fruit and Vegetables has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 857/2003 of 16 May 2003 opening an invitation to tender for the allocation of A3 export licences for fruit and vegetables (tomatoes, oranges, lemons and apples)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market (1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The obligations of administrative simplification imposed on Member States in Chapter II of Directive 2006/123/EC, in particular Articles 5 and 8 thereof, include the obligation to simplify the procedures and formalities applicable to the access to and exercise of a service activity and the obligation to ensure that those procedures and formalities may be easily completed by service providers at a distance and by electronic means through the ‘points of single contact’.
(2) The completion of procedures and formalities through the ‘points of single contact’ must be possible across borders between Member States as set out in Article 8 of Directive 2006/123/EC.
(3) To comply with the obligation to simplify procedures and formalities and to facilitate the cross-border use of the ‘points of single contact’, procedures by electronic means should rely on simple solutions, including as regards the use of electronic signatures. In cases where, after an appropriate risk assessment of concrete procedures and formalities, a high level of security or equivalence to a handwritten signature is deemed to be necessary, advanced electronic signatures based on a qualified certificate, with or without a secure signature creation device, could be required from service providers for certain procedures and formalities.

In order to facilitate effective cross-border use of advanced electronic signatures based on a qualified certificate, trust in these electronic signatures should be enhanced irrespective of the Member State in which the signatory or the certification service provider issuing the qualified certificate is established. This could be achieved by making the information necessary to validate the electronic signatures more easily available in a trustworthy form, in particular information relating to certification service providers who are supervised/accredited in a Member State and to the services they offer.

Whereas Directive 64/432/EEC laid down, for intra-Community trade in bovine animals, health guarantees relating to brucellosis; whereas, however, Article 7 (1) (C) thereof allows Member States to grant derogations until 31 December 1983 concerning trade in bovine animals which are intended for meat production and which are under 30 months of age; whereas Article 7 (1) (E) of that Directive also allows Member States to grant derogations concerning trade in bovine animals which are intended for meat production and which are under 42 days of age or have been castrated before the age of four months; whereas these authorizations may also be applied in respect of bovine animals intended for slaughter;
Whereas it is appropriate to facilitate trade in bovine animals while at the same time taking account of the current brucellosis situation in certain Member States;
Whereas the Community is successfully applying an accelerated scheme for brucellosis eradication;
Whereas, however, in certain Member States the total elimination of brucellosis has not yet been achieved, although it is expected that this objective will be realized within the next two years;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (1) stipulates in Article 21 that certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Morocco, specified in the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters of 12 March 1977 (2), shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties within the limits of an annual Community tariff quota of 50 000 hectolitres; whereas these wines must be put up in containers holding two litres or less; whereas the tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for the period 1 July 1984 to 30 June 1985;
Whereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas the wines in question may benefit from this tariff quota on condition that Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1595/83 (4), is complied with;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for this quota to all imports of the products concerned into the Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect most accurately the actual development of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, assessed by reference to both the statistics relating to imports of the said products from Morocco over a representative reference period and the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each of the types of wines in question are available and no reliable estimates of future imports can be made; whereas, in these circumstances, the quota volume should be allocated in initial shares, taking into account demand for these wines on the markets of the various Member States;
Whereas, to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve intended to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States who have used up their initial share; whereas, in order to guarantee some degree of security to importers in each Member State, the first instalment of the Community quota should be fixed at a level which could, in the present circumstances, be 50 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to take this into account and to avoid a break in continuity, any Member State which has used up almost all of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this should be done by each Member State each time one of its additional shares is almost used up, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be in a position to follow the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a substantial quantity of its initial share remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that it should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, to prevent part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1385/84 of 15 May 1984 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within subheading ex 22.05 C of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in Morocco (1984/85)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 108(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above,
Whereas:
I.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Decision C(2004) 772 of 16 March 2004 (1), the Commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) of the Treaty in respect of a number of financial flows and transfers to and from Olympic Airlines (OAL) and Olympic Airways Services (OAS).
(2) On 14 September 2005, by negative Commission Decision C(2005) 2706 (2), the Commission closed case C11/2004 involving illegal and incompatible State aid granted to OAL and OAS.
(3) By Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008 (3) and by Decision C(2009) 1824 of 10 March 2009 (4), the Commission authorised the sale of certain key assets of OAL and OAS, concluding that the sale did not entail State aid, provided it was conducted in line with the requirements set out in those decisions.
(4) Subsequently, OAL and OAS were put into liquidation. Their remaining assets were to be sold by the liquidator through a liquidation procedure, and a Monitoring Trustee was appointed to oversee this process.
(5) On 13 September 2010, the General Court partially annulled the negative Commission State aid Decision C(2005) 2706 of 14 September 2005 (5). The General Court found that the Commission had not sufficiently established that some of the contested measures in respect of OAS amounted to illegal State aid incompatible with the internal market and that as regards some of the measures in respect of OAL the Commission had failed to state reasons.
(6) The General Court partially annulled Decision C(2005) 2706 which had ordered the recovery of aid granted a) to Olympic Airlines by way of an overvaluation by EUR 91,5 million of Olympic Airways' assets transferred to Olympic Airlines, for failing to establish/demonstrate that this measure amounted to illegal State aid incompatible with the internal market, and b) to Olympic Airlines by way of accepting discounted aircraft sub-lease payments amounting to EUR 39,75 million, for failing to state reasons.
(7) The Commission did not appeal the partial annulment.
(8) By letters of 8 October 2010, 26 July 2011, 12 October 2011, 7 March 2012, 16 November 2012, 7 February 2013, 25 June 2013 and 19 December 2013 the Commission enquired as to the details and progress of the liquidation process.
(9) The Greek authorities replied by letters of 8 November 2010, 11 August 2011, 15 December 2011, 10 July 2012, 4 February 2013, 22 April 2013 and 5 August 2013.
II.   DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURES
(10) As regards the overvaluation of Olympic Airways' assets, the Commission had concluded in its Decision C(2005) 2706 that by overvaluing the assets transferred to Olympic Airlines at the time of its creation, Greece had granted to Olympic Airways State aid amounting to EUR 91,5 million, which was illegal and incompatible with the internal market.
(11) As regards the sub-lease payments, the Commission found in its Decision C(2005) 2706 that Greece had unlawfully granted State aid to Olympic Airlines by means of the discounted sub-leases concluded with Olympic Airlines.
(12) By letter dated 8 November 2010, the Greek authorities confirmed that as of 2 October 2009, the Athens Court of Appeal had entered both companies into special liquidation in line with Article 14A of Law 3429/2005 as supplemented by Article 40 of Law 3710/2008.
(13) The Greek authorities also confirmed that all commercial activities and operations of the two companies ceased during 2009 and that 'Ethniki Kefalaiou', a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Bank of Greece, had been appointed as liquidator.
(14) In line with Commission Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008, the Monitoring Trustee submitted its final report with regard to the sale of certain key assets of OAL and OAS.
(15) According to the information provided by the Greek authorities and the Monitoring Trustee, all essential parts of the sale process, including the setting-up of the new companies and their sale to an investor at market price and the cessation of operations of the old companies were in compliance with Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008.
(16) According to the information provided by the Greek authorities, the liquidation of OAL and OAS is ongoing. There are still some assets left which are unlikely to be easily sold. Once the sale has been completed the registration of the recovery claims will take effect.
III.   CONCLUSION
(17) OAL AND OAS have been put into liquidation procedure and certain key assets have been transferred to different purchasers at market price by way of an open, unconditional and non-discriminatory tender procedure, in compliance with Commission Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008. Furthermore, most of OAL and OAS assets have been sold and the few remaining are in the process of being sold. As the entities in liquidation are no longer carrying out an economic activity, it is highly improbable that they will ever resume such activity in the future.
(18) Consequently, a formal investigation into the remaining matters is unnecessary. The investigation procedure initiated by Decision C(2004) 772 of 16 March 2004 can, therefore, be closed on the grounds that it lacks useful purpose.
(19) The major part of the recovery obligation imposed by Commission Decision C(2005) 2706 of 14 September 2005 has already taken place.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2).

(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1058/2011 (5). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 379 thereof,
Having regard to the application by Belgium,
Whereas Belgium, by letter of 6 October 1995, applied to the Commission for authorization to invoke Article 379 of the Act of Accession for safeguard measures, aimed at refusing the import into Belgium of pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected in Belgium by a product patent but not in Spain;
Whereas in their request, the Belgian authorities provided the Commission with the material facts to enable it to evaluate the validity of the application;
Whereas the Belgian authorities base their application upon the economic difficulties to which the pharmaceutical products market in Belgium would, according to them, be subjected as a result of the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, namely as from 7 October 1995; whereas they argue that since the price of pharmaceuticals on the Spanish market is lower than observed price for the same speciality products on the Belgian market, the expiry of the transitional period will lead to an appreciable increase in parallel imports from Spain into Belgium; whereas this increase will also damage parts of the market shared by Belgian operators in the export market;
Whereas Article 379 derogates from a fundamental principle of the EC Treaty, that of the free movement of goods; whereas consequently in accordance with the well-established case-law of the Court of Justice it should be restrictively interpreted;
Whereas consequently, in accordance with that case-law and with the established practice of the Commission in the past, Article 379 cannot apply;
Whereas the purpose of Article 379 is to rectify and adjust to the economy of the common market a given economic sector experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist;
Whereas an analysis of the economic data provided by the Belgian authorities has shown that the conditions for the application of Article 379 are not fulfilled; whereas, more particularly, it has revealed that the Belgian pharmaceutical industry is not experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist; whereas an increase in the volume of imports coming from Spain of pharmaceutical products patented in Belgium but not in Spain would not appear to be so significant in the long run as to bring about, by itself, serious economic difficulties on the Belgian pharmaceutical market,","{'title': ""96/319/EC: Commission Decision of 20 December 1995 refusing Belgium's application for protective measures with regard to pharmaceutical products coming from Spain (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe application for safeguard measures made by Belgium under Article 379 of the Act of Accession, aimed at refusing the import into Belgium of pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected by a product patent in Belgium but not in Spain, is rejected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 1995.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario MONTI\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

Whereas, under Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are fixed annually before the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas because of the importance of apple-growing in the Community it is necessary to fix a reference price for apples;
Whereas apples harvested during a given crop year are marketed from July of one year to June of the following year; whereas reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period from 1 July up to and including 30 June of the following year;
Whereas to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas producer prices are the average of the prices recorded during the three years prior to the date of fixing the reference price, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or for part of it and which satisfy specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market must be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 147 of the Act of Accession, Spanish prices shall be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices as and from 1 January 1990;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first stage of accession;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For spinetoram the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2008/740/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 17 October 2007 an application from Dow AgroSciences Ltd for the inclusion of the active substance spinetoram in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2008/740/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 23 February 2012.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance spinetoram (4) on 6 May 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 13 December 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for spinetoram.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing spinetoram may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve spinetoram.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing spinetoram. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations.

(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 establishing new rules on aid to shipbuilding(1), and in particular to Article 3(2) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above(2),
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) On 6 November 2001 Spain notified the Commission of its request to be granted an extension of the delivery limit for four liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers contracted by the Spanish shipbuilding group IZAR. By letter dated 24 April 2002 the Commission informed Spain that it had decided to initiate a proceeding under Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the measure. Spain replied by letter dated 4 June 2002, registered on 6 June 2002.
(2) The Commission decision to initiate a proceeding was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3). The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments.
(3) The Commission received comments from interested parties. It forwarded them to Spain, which was given the opportunity to react; its comments were received by letter dated 3 December 2002.
II. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID
(4) Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1540/98 (the shipbuilding Regulation) states that the operating aid rate applicable to a contract shall be that in force at the date of signature of the final contract. However, for any ship delivered more than three years from the date of signing of the final contract the ceiling applicable to that contract shall be that in force three years before the date of the vessel's delivery.
(5) According to the same Article, operating aid of 9 % is allowed for ships contracted before 31 December 2000. For ships contracted after that date, no operating aid is allowed. Therefore, without an extension of the three-year delivery limit, no operating aid can be provided for ships delivered after 31 December 2003, even if the contracts were signed before the end of 2000. According to Article 3(2) of the shipbuilding Regulation, the Commission may extend the three-year delivery limit in case of exceptional circumstances or technical complexity of the ships.
(6) Spain has requested an extension of this three-year delivery limit, due to technical complexity, for three LNG tankers built by IZAR. The original request concerned four ships, but in a letter dated 6 March 2002 Spain informed the Commission that one order had been cancelled, and that the request now concerns three ships. IZAR is owned by the Spanish state holding company SEPI, and is a shipbuilding group consisting of six civil and three military yards.
(7) The Spanish notification concerns ships numbers 3 to 5 in the table, with planned dates as follows. Ships 1 and 2, in the same series, are included for comparison.
TABLE
>TABLE>
Note:
S = Sestao shipyard, PR = Puerto Real shipyard.
(8) Spain has referred to a Commission statement(4) from 1990 to the effect that, when the Commission first proposed the possibility of extending the three-year delivery limit for technical reasons, it was taking account in particular of the construction of liquid gas carriers and very large cruise liners. Spain further argues that these ships are at least as complicated as the product tankers for which the Commission granted an extension(5) in 1993. Spain also claims that the production time is no longer than that of other major shipyards building, or having built LNG tankers.
III. COMMENTS FROM THIRD PARTIES
(9) The Commission has received comments from France. France contests a statement in the initiation of the proceeding that the normal period from contract to delivery for LNG tankers is 36 months, and provides figures from Japanese and Korean yards showing that this time is often between 35 and 60 months. France therefore finds it normal that the Spanish yards cannot deliver the five ships before the end of 2003. However, France underlines that Spain should have requested the extension of the three-year delivery limit before the contracts were signed, and not almost one year after. A retrospective extension would to some extent distort competition with other yards interested in the same orders.
IV. COMMENTS FROM SPAIN
(10) Spain agreed with the French comments on the time needed between contract and delivery. Concerning notification of the extension one year after the contracts were signed, Spain stated that it had notified the request in any event and would wait for a Commission decision before any contract-related aid was provided.
V. ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURE
(11) According to Article 87(1) of the Treaty, any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the common market. In accordance with the established case-law of the Community law courts, the criterion of trade being affected is met, if the recipient firm carries out an economic activity involving trade between Member States. Shipbuilding is an economic activity involving trade between Member States.
(12) According to Article 87(3)(e) of the EC Treaty, categories of aid specified by a decision of the Council acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission may be considered compatible with the common market. The Commission notes that the Council adopted the shipbuilding Regulation on this basis on 29 June 1998.
(13) The Commission notes that, according to that Regulation, ""shipbuilding"" means building of self-propelled seagoing commercial vessels. The Commission also notes that the IZAR-owned shipyards Puerto Real and Cadiz build such ships and consequently are undertakings covered by the Regulation.
(14) Under Article 3(1) of the shipbuilding Regulation, a maximum ceiling of 9 % for contract-related operating aid for ships was allowed until 31 December 2000. The aid ceiling applicable to the contract would be the one in force at the date when the final contract is signed. However, this does not apply to ships delivered more than three years after the signing of the contract. In these cases, the ceiling applicable is the one in force three years before the date of the delivery of the ship. Consequently, the last delivery date for a vessel still qualifying for operating aid is 31 December 2003.
(15) Article 3(2) of the shipbuilding Regulation stipulates that ""the Commission may, however, grant an extension of the three-year delivery limit when this is found justified by the technical complexity of the individual shipbuilding project concerned or by delays resulting from unexpected disruptions of a substantial and defensible nature in the working programme of a yard due to exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company"". It will be noted that Spain bases its request for extension of the delivery limit on the technical complexity of the individual shipbuilding project concerned.
(16) The Commission notes that extension of the delivery limit is crucial to deciding whether the ships in question will qualify for contract-related operating aid. The operating aid in question concerns financing from State resources part of the costs that the yard in question would normally have to bear when building a vessel. Therefore, the aid which can be provided if the three-year delivery limit is extended for the ships falls within the scope of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty.
(17) When it initiated the proceeding, the Commission expressed doubts about two aspects of the case. These were the production time and the period between contract and delivery of the vessels in question. These doubts will be analysed below in light of the information received during the proceeding.
(18) As regards the first doubt, the construction period for the LNG tankers, the Commission stated that it currently took only about 30 months to build a vessel of this type. The fact that it is possible to deliver LNG tankers within 36 months of signing the contract led to doubts that such ships could benefit from an extension of the three-year limit due to technical complexity.
(19) On this issue Spain has highlighted the complexity of the ships, and requested that production times should be compared with other EU shipyards and not with the most experienced Korean shipyards. It has also underlined the need to make a certain number of installations at the shipyards concerned, since it is the first time LNG tankers have been built there. Spain also points out that double hull LNG tankers, built in Spain, are more complex than some other LNG tankers, and therefore need a longer construction period.
(20) The information provided during the proceeding has not contradicted the statement made when the proceeding was initiated that, currently, the construction period could be about 30 months. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that LNG tankers are particularly complex ships technically, with a long construction period. It also notes that the fact that the two Spanish yards, and IZAR, are building vessels of this type for the first time, is a valid reason for accepting a somewhat longer production time than in the case of the most experienced Korean shipyards.
(21) Furthermore, the Commission would cite its statement from 1990 to the effect that when it proposed the possibility of extending the three-year limit for technical reasons, it was taking account in particular of the construction of liquid gas tankers and very large cruise liners.
(22) As regards the second doubt, the period from contract to delivery of the vessels concerned, the Commission wondered whether this was not much longer than could be considered necessary. Both France and Spain submitted comments in this respect. Spain states that the average period from contract to delivery for LNG tankers built in the EU is around 49 months, and for LNG tankers built in Asia around 42 months. France agrees that periods from contract to delivery in the major Asian yards are between 35 and 60 months.
(23) The Commission notes that the period from contract to delivery is a combination of the construction period and the time from signing the contract to starting production. The Commission would not be able to extend the delivery period, if the time from contract to the start of production was excessively long. In the present case, the time from contract to start of production of the vessels is 6, 5 and 12 months respectively, which the Commission considers to be acceptable.
(24) For the reasons set out above, the Commission considers that the delivery time may be extended for the vessels concerned in accordance with the abovementioned planned delivery dates.
(25) It will be noted that, when it initiated the proceeding, the Commission stated that, following its negative decision on State aid in the form of tax credits for publicly owned Spanish shipyards (2000/131/EC)(6), the yards in question have not repaid the aid. If, in its final decision on this case, the Commission should find that there is reason to authorise the three-year extension for any of the three LNG tankers, it would also have to examine the relevance of the judgment of the Court of Justice of 15 May 1997 in Case C-355/95 Textilwerke Deggendorf(7), if the abovementioned aid has still not been recovered.
(26) The Commission considers in this respect that it can adopt a decision to suspend payment of aid which is compatible with the common market, the principle in Deggendorf, only if the aid granted in the new decision gives rise to a combination of aid that renders the new aid incompatible. The Commission considers that the present case does not concern the effect of combination on the amount of aid to be authorised, but only whether specific conditions for an extension exist.
(27) The Commission finds, therefore, that the fact that it does not consider that the illegal state aid referred to above has been recovered does not prevent Spain from granting the operating aid linked to the three vessels in question.
(28) Lastly, regarding the French comment that a retrospective extension would to some extent distort competition with other yards interested in the same orders, the Commission notes that Article 3(2) of the Shipbuilding Regulation does not state that requests for an extension of the delivery limit have to be notified before the contracts are signed. The Commission also notes that Spain has informed it that no operating aid will be granted for the vessels in question, unless the Commission decides to extend the delivery period.
