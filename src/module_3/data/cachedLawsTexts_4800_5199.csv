Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the European Agreements between the European Economic Community, the European Coal and  Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, on the one hand, and the Republic of  Hungary, the Republic of Poland and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republik (CSFR), on the other  hand, were signed on 16 Decemer 1991; whereas, pending the entry into force of these Agreements,  the Community has concluded Interim Agreements (1) (2) (3) on trade and trade-related measures with  those countries, also signed on 16 December 1991 and implemented on 1 March 1992;
Whereas Articles 3 and 14 of the Interim Agreements stipulate that certain products originating in  the countries in question may attract a reduced or zero rate of duty on import into the Community,  within the limits of tariff quotas or ceilings; whereas, pursuant to the provisions annexed to  those Agreements, the volumes of the tariff quotas and ceilings, established when the Europe  Agreements were signed, must be increased, from the date on which the Interim Agreements enter into  force, by a percentage specific to each country and category of products;
Whereas, further, for imports of some processed agricultural products not covered by Annex II to  the Treaty, Article 13 and Protocol N° 3 of each of these Interim Agreements provide for the fixing  of reduced variable components in accordance with each Protocol of the Agreements in question,  within the limits of the quotas set or established in accordance with the Protocols concerned;  whereas such Protocols provide for an annual increment of the volume of the quotas during the first  five years of application;
Whereas it seems advisable, in the interests of clarity, to divide the products subject to tariff  ceilings and quotas into two groups, in Annexes I and II to this Regulation, one for industrial  products and one for agricultural products, specifying for each product the volume of its quota or  ceiling and the rate of customs duty applicable; whereas Annexes III, IV and V to this Regulation,  with their pertinent provisions, should group the processed agricultural products attracting a  reduced variable component and originating, respectively, in Hungary, Poland and the territory of  the former CSFR;
Whereas the decision for the opening of Community quotas should be taken by the Community, in the  execution of its international obligations, in the case of the products listed in Annexes I, II,  III, IV and V to this Regulation; whereas particular care should be taken to ensure that all  Community importers have equal and continuous access to those quotas and that the rates laid down  for the quotas are applied to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until  the quotas are exhausted; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these  quotas, there is no obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the  necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of  administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and close  cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able  to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, in the case of the products listed in Annexes I and II to this Regulation which are  subject to Community tariff ceilings, Community surveillance may be achieved by means of an  administrative procedure based on charging imports of the products in question against the ceilings  at Community level as and when those products are entered with the customs authorities for free  circulation;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly rapid cooperation between the  Member States and the Commission, and the latter must in particular be able to monitor quantities  charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to  be particularly close, since the Commission must be able to take appropriate measures to  reintroduce customs duties once a ceiling is reached;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within, and jointly represented by, the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of these tariff measures may be carried out by any one of its  members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3918/92 of 28 December 1992 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas and ceilings for certain agricultural and industrial products and establishing a reduced variable component for certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary, Poland and the territory of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic (CSFR) (1993)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1993 goods originating in Hungary,  Poland and the territory of the former CSFR which are listed in Annexes I and II to this Regulation  shall be subject to Community tariff quotas or ceilings, according to the provisions contained  within the said Annexes.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1993 goods originating in Hungary, Poland and the  territory of the former CSFR listed in Annexes III, IV and V to this Regulation shall be subject to  a reduced variable component determined in accordance with Article 3, within the limits of the  quotas and under the conditions set out in those Annexes.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe reduced variable components applicable from 1 January to 31 December 1993 shall be  calculated as follows:\n\n(a) the difference established in accordance with Article 6 (2) of Regulation (EEC) N° 3033/80 of  11 November 1980 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the  processing of agricultural products (1), between the average threshold price and the average cif  price or free-at-frontier price for each basic product shall be reduced by 20 %; however, the  differences established, for common wheat, as far as Hungary is concerned, for the basic products  falling within Chapter 4 of the combined nomenclature, as far as Poland and the territory of the  former CSFR are concerned, and for barley, as far as the territory of the former CSFR is concerned,  shall be reduced by 40 %;\n\n(b) the amounts thus obtained shall apply to the quantities of basic products considered to have  been used in the manufacture of the goods concerned in accordance with Article 4 (1) of Regulation  (EEC) N° 3033/80.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe variable components to be applied to those goods which are mentioned in the Annex  to Regulation (EEC) N° 3033/80 but not mentioned in, respectively, Annexes III, IV and V to this  Regulation, and to those goods which are mentioned in the said Annexes in amounts exceeding the  quotas laid down in them, shall be those which are established by direct application of Article 6  of Regulation (EEC) N° 3033/80.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas the Council resolution of 19 June 1989 on the implementation of a plan of priority actions in the field of statistical information: statistical programme of the European Communities (1989 to 1992) (2) highlighted the need for a comprehensive and  coherent framework that would satisfy Community statistical information requirements by ensuring the approximation of methods and a common basis for concepts, definitions and standards;
Whereas the statistical programme of the European Communities provides for the improvement of statistics on services as a necessary instrument for the efficient functioning of the internal market; whereas the inventory of available information, carried  out in the framework of the statistical programme, highlighted considerable gaps in service statistics;
Whereas Council Decision 89/490/EEC of 28 July 1989 on the improvement of the business environment and the promotion of the development of enterprises, and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, in the Community (3), may necessitate providing  these enterprises, most of which are in the service sectors, with statistical information to enable them to operate efficiently in the internal market;
Whereas in Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom, of 13 February 1989 concerning the harmonization of the compilation of gross national product at market prices (4) it is stated that improved GNPmp coverage presupposes the development of statistical  bases; whereas the growing importance of services in the economy makes statistics on services an essential component of these statistical bases;
Whereas the Council resolution of 14 November 1989 on internal trade in the context of the internal market (5) highlighted the need to improve trade statistics by making them compatible with Community definitions;
Whereas in Council Decision 88/524/EEC of 26 July 1988 concerning the establishment of a plan of action for setting up an information services market (6), basic information on this sector is considered necessary for formulating policy on this market;
Whereas, taking acount of Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in the Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities  (7), the collection of comparable basic information on audiovisual services is essential for the integration and further development of this sector;
Whereas in the resolution of the European Parliament of 17 March 1989 on the impact of infrastructures and the tertiary sector on regional development - prospects for a new regional policy (8), the Commission is asked to supply harmonized data on  services, broken down by regions;
Whereas multilateral negotiations on international trade in services require improved statistics to achieve effective long-term liberalization;
Whereas attention must be devoted to simplifying as far as possible collection procedures for enterprises, while maintaining data quality, by developing appropriate basic statistical tools, and to ensuring that the administrative burden on enterprises  is not needlessly increased;
Whereas for the purpose of monitoring the establishment of a people's Europe, an exploratory study should be carried out into the possibility of extending the collection of statistics to cover non-commercial services for individuals and the community;
Whereas a programme lasting two years is called for;
Whereas an amount of ECU 8,5 million is estimated as necessary to implement this two-year programme;
Whereas the amounts to be committed for the financing of the two-year programme for the period after the financial year 1992 will have to fall within the Community financial framework in force,","{'title': '92/326/EEC: Council Decision of 18 June 1992 establishing a two-year programme (1992 to 1993) for the development of European statistics on services', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nA two-year programme (1992 to 1993) for the development of European statistics on services (hereinafter referred to as 'the programme') is hereby established.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe objectives of the programme referred to in Article 1 shall be as follows:\n\n(a) to set out a European reference framework for statistics on services defining the most appropriate concepts and methods for managing and monitoring Community policies, especially the implementation of the Single European Act, and for satisfying the  possible needs of national, regional and local administrations, international organizations, economic operators and professional associations;\n\n(b) to establish a European statistical information system for services;\n\n(c) to promote and support harmonization of statistics on services in the Member States,\n\nwithout, however, needlessly increasing the burden on undertakings.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nWith a view to achieving the objectives referred to in Article 2, the following measures shall be taken in line with the action plan set out in the Annex:\n\n(a) analysis and evaluation of user demand for statistics on services;\n\n(b) development of a methodological framework for statistics on services;\n\n(c) setting up of the organizational and technical components of a European statistical information system for services;\n\n(d) where applicable, carrying out of pilot surveys of service enterprises;\n\n(e) development of basic statistical tools.\n\nAs far as possible, the Commission shall use existing instruments and procedures to carry out these tasks, applying the principle of subsidiarity.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\n1.

This reference framework will increase the comparability of data  between the different service sectors and the various Member States, despite the fact that service activities vary from one country to another because of different practices and legal systems. The methodological framework will be used as the basic  harmonization tool for the development of official European statistics on services and as a recommended framework for non-official statistics, particularly for market research.\n\nThe establishment and the implementatin of the methodological framework will proceed in phases taking account, inter alia, of the progressive identification of users' needs and priorities.\n\n(c) Setting up a European statistical information system for services\n\nThe collected data will be integrated into the Mercure statistical information system which will encompass:\n\n- official data collected under national statistical systems,\n\n- data from other Eurostat projects on services,\n\n- non-official data that may be collected by Eurostat in cooperation with other Community services.\n\nWhen supplying official data, the Member States will forward to the Commission any information concerning the reliability thereof which could restrict the arrangements for its use or publication.\n\nThe Member States will forward confidential data in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on Statistical Office of the European Communities (1).\n\nThis data will relate primarily to the following sectors:\n\n- distributive trade,\n\n- hotels, restaurants, cafés and travel agencies,\n\n- transport,\n\n- financial services (including insurance),\n\n- communications and information services, audio-visual services,\n\n- business services.\n\nThe data in the Mercure information system will be made available through:\n\n- a data base to be set up by the Commission,\n\n- statistical pubications on all service sectors, gradually incorporating all variables dealt with.\n\nAs regards non-commercial services to individuals and the community, the Commission will initiate an exploratory study on concepts and definitions during the period 1992 to 1993, intended to establish whether, and, if so, what information is necessary  in the Member States for measuring the importance of the following sectors:\n\n- social security,\n\n- education,\n\n- health and social work,\n\n- activities of membership organizations,\n\n- recreational, cultural and sporting activities,\n\n- other services to individuals and the community.\n\n(d) Carrying out pilot surveys of service enterprises\n\nImproving the availability of data on services the carrying out of pilot surveys in Member States which do not have comparable survey instruments in certain service sectors. The pilot surveys will supply preliminary data for the sectors covered and  prepare the way for regular data collection based on the methodology. These pilot surveys will be carried out in accordance with the concepts and methods developed in the methodological framework, will cover only the service sectors and will be carried  out only in the Member States where there is insufficient data.\n\nPriority will be given to those activities which are most dynamic and to those which are least covered by existing statistics.\n\n(e) Developing basic statistical tools\n\nBasic statistical tools must be developed in order to semplify as far as possible data collection procedures for enterprises, whilst maintaining data quality. These statistical tools are part of an infrastructure common to both industry and services.  These include registers, EDI (electronic data interchange) techniques, classification systems, sampling, questionnaires, survey processing tools and research into the convergence of statistical and accounting concepts.\n\n(1) OJ No L 151, 15. 6. 1991, p. 1.""}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 establishes veterinary conditions applying to non-commercial movements of pet dogs, cats and ferrets.
(2) Commission Decision 2003/803/EC (2) establishes a model passport for non-commercial movements of animals of those species between Member States, and Commission Decision 2004/203/EC (3) establishes a model certificate for non-commercial movements from third countries.
(3) From 3 July 2004 documents complying with those models should be presented to the authorities responsible for checks.
(4) To facilitate the transition to the arrangements of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, certificates issued for non-commercial entry into a Member State before that Regulation applies, should be considered valid until their expiry date if they comply with the conditions established by that Regulation.
(5) Nevertheless, as regard the specific situation of Member States listed in Annex II, part A, it is appropriate to maintain during this transitional period the national conditions applicable to the acceptance of rabies certification.
(6) It is also appropriate to recognise as valid antibody titrations performed on the basis of national provisions which were applicable before the adoption of Commission Decision 2001/296/EC of 29 March 2001 authorising laboratories to check the effectiveness of vaccination against rabies in certain domestic carnivores (4).
(7) Furthermore, taking into account the request of certain third countries, the model passport established by Decision 2003/803/EC for non-commercial intra-Community movements of dogs, cats and ferrets should be recognised as valid for non-commercial movements of animals of those species from third countries listed in section 2 of part B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 as an alternative to the certificates in force for movements from third countries.
(8) Since Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 will apply from 3 July 2004, this Decision should apply from the same date.

(2) The Republic of Bulgaria has informed the Commission that, due to unforeseen reduction in budget revenues in 2009 as a result of the economic crisis, the necessary financial resources were not available for releasing within the deadlines set by Decision 2009/1/EC the 2 500-2 690 MHz band in order to designate it and make it available, on a non-exclusive basis, for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services.

(4) Bulgaria has provided sufficient justification to its request for an extension of the transitional derogation. Bulgaria has informed the Commission that in 2009, it took the necessary non-financial preparatory measures to assign new frequencies to the national security service in order to replace the 2 500-2 690 MHz band and that the necessary financial resources would be made available in 2010 for the deployment of the new mobile radio communication system to be used for national security purposes.
(5) The members of the Radio Spectrum Committee indicated at the Committee meeting on 10-11 December 2009 that they do not object to this extension of the transitional derogation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1), Article 11 and Article 12 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on susceptible species leaving those zones.
(2) Article 6(1)(c) of Directive 2000/75/EC provides that where the presence of the bluetongue virus is officially confirmed, the official veterinarian is to extend certain measures provided for in Article 4 of that Directive to holdings located within a radius of 20 kilometres around the infected holding. Those measures aim at containing the disease in an initial state after virus introduction into a newly infected zone.
(3) However, in accordance with Article 6(2) those measures may be modulated by the affected Member State on the basis of the positive outcome of a risk assessment which takes into account geographical, epidemiological, ecological, entomological, meteorological and historical data and active surveillance results, including percentage of seropositive animals, virus serotype circulating and occurrence of vectors likely to be competent.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to lay down requirements for the exemption from the movement ban for animals leaving the 20 kilometres area around the infected holding, including animals destined for intra-Community trade and export, after having obtained the prior approval of the competent authority of the place of destination.
(5) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones (2) provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue.
(6) Commission Decision 93/444/EEC of 2 July 1993 on detailed rules governing intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products intended for exportation to third countries (3) provides that animals intended for export must be accompanied until the exit point from the Community by a certificate which contains, where necessary, the additional guarantees provided for by Community legislation for animals intended for slaughter. Accordingly, the certificate covering animals for export should include a reference to any insecticide treatment carried out pursuant to Decision 2005/393/EC.
(7) It is appropriate to provide for the conditions for the treatment of the animals and the means of transport with authorised insecticides at the place of loading from the restricted zones destined for or passing through areas outside a restricted zone. When during the transit through a restricted zone, a rest period is foreseen in a control post the animals must be protected from any attacks by vectors.
(8) Decision 2005/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

fixing the final complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries for the 2006/2007 marketing year
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 29(4),
Whereas:
(1) Article 29(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that, during the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years and in order to ensure adequate supply to Community refineries, import duties on a complementary quantity of imports of raw cane sugar originating in the States referred to in Annex VI to that Regulation are to be suspended.
(2) That complementary quantity should be calculated in accordance with Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 950/2006 of 28 June 2006 laying down detailed rules of application for the 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and 2008/2009 marketing years for the import and refining of sugar products under certain tariff quotas and preferential agreements (2), on the basis of an exhaustive Community forecast supply balance for raw sugar.
(3) For the 2006/2007 marketing year, the balance indicates the need to import a complementary quantity of raw sugar for refining of 334 025 tonnes in white sugar equivalent so that the Community refineries’ supply needs can be met. This complementary quantity includes an estimation of applications for import licences in the final months of the 2006/2007 marketing year, concerning imports referred to in Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1100/2006 of 17 July 2006 laying down, for the marketing years 2006/2007, 2007/08 and 2008/2009, detailed rules for the opening and administration of tariff quotas for raw cane-sugar for refining, originating in least developed countries, as well as detailed rules applying to the importation of products of tariff heading 1701 originating in least developed countries (3).
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2006 of 18 August 2006 fixing the complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries in the period from 1 July 2006 to 30 September 2007 (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 92/2007 of 30 January 2007 fixing a complementary quantity of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States and India for supply to refineries for the marketing year 2006/2007 (5) already fixed complementary quantities of respectively 82 500 tonnes and 120 000 tonnes. It is therefore appropriate to fix the final quantity of complementary sugar of 131 525 tonnes for the marketing year 2006/2007.
(5) Adequate supply of the refineries can only be guaranteed if the traditional export agreements between the beneficiary countries are respected. Therefore a breakdown between the beneficiary countries or group of countries is needed. For India, a quantity of 6 000 tonnes is opened which brings the total quantity for the 2006/2007 marketing year for India to 22 000 tonnes which is considered an economically viable shipping quantity. The remaining quantities should be fixed for the ACP States, which have collectively undertaken to implement between themselves procedures for the allocation of the quantities in order to ensure the appropriate supply of the refineries.
(6) Prior to the import of this complementary sugar, the refiners need to make supply and shipping arrangements with the beneficiary countries and trade. In order to allow them to prepare for the application for import licences in due time, it is appropriate to provide for the entry into force of this Regulation as from the date of its publication.

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas florfenicol should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas gonadotrophin releasing hormone should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90; whereas by extrapolation of scientific data this classification into Annex II shall apply to all food-producing animals;
Whereas moxidectin, should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 in order to allow for the establishment of the specificity of the analytical method against Doramectin for which a standard must become publicly available;
Whereas ceftiofur should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 in order to allow for the completion of the validation of the analytical method for bovine and porcine liver and fat tissues; whereas surveillance of residues of ceftiofur is assured by monitoring bovine and porcine muscle and kidney tissues;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4) to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

(2003/490/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member States' laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations, and giving particular consideration to a number of elements relevant for the transfer and listed in Article 25(2) thereof. The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data, established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC, issued guidance on the making of such assessments(2).
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be made and enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail, nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) As regards Argentina, the legal standards on the protection of personal data have been provided for in general and sector-specific rules. Both of them have binding legal effect.
(6) General rules are laid down in the Constitution, the Personal Data Protection Act No 25.326 and the Regulation approved by Decree No 1558/2001 (hereinafter ""Argentine Law"").
(7) The Argentine Constitution provides for a special judicial remedy for the protection of personal data, known as ""habeas data"". This is a subcategory of the procedure enshrined in the Constitution for the protection of constitutional rights and therefore makes the protection of personal data a fundamental right. According to Article 43.3 of the Constitution any person is entitled, under the ""habeas data"" rule, to know the content and purpose of all the data pertaining to him or her contained in public records or data banks, or in private ones whose purpose is to provide reports. According to that Article in case of falsehood of information or its use for discriminatory purposes, a person will be able to demand the deletion, correction, confidentiality or update of the data contained in the above records. The Article will not affect the secrecy of journalistic information sources. Argentine jurisprudence has recognised ""habeas data"" as a fundamental and directly applicable right.
(8) The Personal Data Protection Act No 25.326 of 4 October 2000 (hereinafter ""the Act"") develops and widens the Constitutional provisions. It contains provisions relating to general data protection principles, the rights of data subjects, the obligations of data controllers and data users, the supervisory authority or controlling body, sanctions, and rules of procedure in seeking ""habeas data"" as a judicial remedy.
(9) The Regulation, approved by Decree No 1558/2001 of 3 December 2001 (hereinafter ""the Regulation""), lays down rules for the enactment of the Act, supplements its provisions, and clarifies points of the Act that may be subject to diverging interpretation.
(10) Argentine Law covers the protection of personal data recorded in data files, registers, data banks or other technical means, which are public; and the protection of personal data recorded in data files, registers, data banks or other technical means which are private, whose purpose is to provide reports. This includes those which go beyond an exclusively personal use, and those which are intended for the assignment or transfer of personal data, irrespective of whether the circulation of the data or information produced is performed for payment or free of charge.
(11) Certain provisions of the Act apply uniformly throughout Argentina. They include general provisions and provisions concerning general data protection principles, rights of the data subjects, obligations of data controllers and users of data files, registers and data banks, criminal sanctions, and the existence and main features of the ""habeas data"" judicial remedy as established in the Constitution.
(12) Other provisions of the Act apply to registers, data files, databases or data banks which are interconnected through networks at inter-jurisdictional (meaning ""interprovincial""), national or international level, and which are considered as falling within federal jurisdiction. They concern the control exercised by the supervisory authority, sanctions imposed by the supervisory authority, and the rules of procedure concerning the ""habeas data"" judicial remedy. Other kinds of registers, data files, databases or data banks should be regarded as falling under provincial jurisdiction. The provinces may issue legal provisions on these matters.
(13) Data protection provisions are also contained in a number of legal instruments regulating different sectors, such as credit card transactions, statistics, banking or health.
(14) Argentine Law covers all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, even if exceptions and limitations are also provided in order to safeguard important public interests. The application of these standards is guaranteed by a special, simplified and quick judicial remedy for the protection of personal data, known as ""habeas data"", along with the general judicial remedies. The Act provides for the establishment of a data protection controlling body charged with taking all actions necessary for compliance with the objectives and provisions of the Act and endowed with powers of investigation and intervention. Pursuant to the Regulation, the National Directorate for the Protection of Personal Data was established as the controlling body. Argentine Law provides for effective dissuasive sanctions, of both an administrative and a criminal nature. Furthermore, the provisions of Argentine law regarding civil liability (both contractual and extra-contractual) apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned.
(15) The Argentine government has provided explanations and assurances as to how the Argentine law is to be interpreted, and has given assurances that the Argentine data protection rules are implemented in accordance with such interpretation. This Decision is based on these explanations and assurances, and is therefore conditional upon them. In particular, this decision relies on the explanations and assurances given by the Argentine authorities as to how the Argentine law is to be interpreted as regards which situations fall within the scope of the Argentine law in data protection.
(16) Argentina should therefore be regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data as referred to in Directive 95/46/EC.
(17) In the interest of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(18) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered an opinion on the level of protection of personal data in Argentina(3), which has been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision.
(19) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31(1) of Directive 95/46/EC,","{'title': '2003/490/EC: Commission Decision of 30 June 2003 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data in Argentina (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of Article 25(2) of Directive 95/46/EC, Argentina is regarded as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Community.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision concerns only the adequacy of protection provided in Argentina with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC and does not affect other conditions or restrictions implementing other provisions of that Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Where dealing with financial services, the household should be understood as any member of the household.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Modes of data collection\nFor all target variables the mode of data collection is personal interview with the household respondent or extraction from registers.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Reference periods\nThe target variables relate to four types of reference periods:\n—\nlast 12 months (\nArrears\n),\n—\nnext 12 months (\nFuture expectations\n),\n—\nlast three months (\nUncleared balance credit/store card\n),\n—\ncurrent (\nAll other variables\n).\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Definitions\n(1)\xa0\xa0\xa0Amounts\n(a)\nVariables for collecting amounts: the amount is to be collected according to a harmonised discrete scale to be established by the Working Group on Living Conditions.\n(2)\xa0\xa0\xa0Bank account\n(a)\nBank current account: deposit account offering day-to-day money management facilities such as various flexible payment methods to allow customers to distribute money directly to others. Standard services offered by current accounts include a cheque book, the facility to arrange standing orders, direct debits and payment via a debit card. A savings account is not a current account where no such facilities are available.\n(b)\nBank account overdraft: the household is currently maintaining a negative balance on one of its bank accounts because of financial difficulties (urgent need of money, output higher than input, etc.). Interest is charged on the amount owed. The bank account does not need to be a current account.\n(3)\xa0\xa0\xa0Credit/store cards\n(a)\nCredit cards (Visa, Amex, MasterCard, Diners, etc.) provide a specific credit facility: money is lent to people between the time they purchase goods and the time of full repayment of the amount; interest is to be paid on any balance that is not cleared at the end of the month. There are monthly statements for the money spent specifying the minimum amount to be paid. Credit cards are not bank debit cards, where the money spent on the card is immediately deducted from a linked bank account.\n(b)\nStore cards are credit cards issued by a single company/store and can only be used for payments to that company/store.\n(c)\nUncleared balance: the household has not paid in full at the ‘end of the month’ the amount spent or owed with credit/store cards for at least the last three months because of financial difficulties.\n(4)\xa0\xa0\xa0Source of credit and loans\n(a)\nCredit and loans encompasses any commercial credit or loans with planned and scheduled repayments, except mortgage loans for the main dwelling. Overdraft facilities, credit or store cards for which repayments are not planned are not included. Borrowing from friends and relatives (informal credit) is not included either.\n(5)\xa0\xa0\xa0Arrears\n(a)\nArrears: amount owed (bills, rent, credit/mortgage repayment, etc.) not paid on schedule during the last 12 months for financial reasons; same concept as used for HS010, HS020 and HS030.\n(b)\nTotal amount currently in arrears: the sum of the amounts the household currently owes that could not be paid on schedule.\n(c)\nHousing-related bills/payments: rent and mortgage repayment for the main dwelling and utility bills (water, electricity, gas, heating, etc.). Should correspond to the coverage of variables HS010 and HS020.\n(d)\nOther loans and credit repayment: cash loans (other than mortgage repayment for the main dwelling) or hire purchase instalments and the like (e.g. mail order catalogues, car finance, etc.). Minimum credit/store card repayments are also included. Should correspond to the coverage of variable HS030.\n(e)\nOther non-housing household bills: education, health, any other bills not covered by housing-related bills.\n(6)\xa0\xa0\xa0Drop in income\n(a)\nIncome: gross total income of the household.\n(7)\xa0\xa0\xa0Financial exclusion\n(a)\nReasons why the household does not have a current bank account and needs one: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI111-MI114. Questions are filtered: households that do have a bank current account or do not need one should not be asked the questions.\n(b)\nReasons why the household does not have commercial credit and needs it: several reasons can be mentioned and will be reported though indicators variables MI122-MI125. Commercial credit: overdraft facilities, credit or store cards, mortgages and other loans or credit linked to purchases. Borrowing from friends and relatives is not included. Questions are filtered: households that do have commercial credit or do not need it should not be asked the questions. Households having borrowed only from family and friends should be asked the questions.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Transmission of data to Eurostat\nThe target secondary variables on ‘over-indebtedness and financial exclusion’ will be sent to Eurostat in the household data file (H) after the target primary variables.\nAREAS AND LIST OF TARGET VARIABLES\nVariable name\nModule 2008\nOver-indebtedness and financial exclusion\nCode\nTarget variable\nBank accounts and overdraft\nMI010\nHousehold has a bank current account\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI010_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\nMI020\nHousehold is overdrawn on one of its bank accounts\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI020_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no bank account)\nMI025\nEstimated total amount unbalanced on household's banks accounts in classes\n1-9\nClass\nMI025_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no overdraft: MI020=2)\nCredit/store cards\nMI030\nHousehold has credit card(s) and/or store card(s)\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI030_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\nMI040\nHousehold has credit card(s) and/or store card(s) with uncleared balances\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI040_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no credit/store card (MI030=2))\nMI045\nEstimated total amount unbalanced at the last monthly statement on household credit/store cards in classes\n1-9\nClass\nMI045_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no unbalanced credit/store card (MI040=2 or MI030=2))\nSource of credits and loans\nMI050\nHousehold has credits or loans (other than mortgage for the main dwelling)\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI050_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\nMI051\nHousehold has mortgage for other than the main dwelling\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI051_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI052\nHousehold has hire purchase instalments (e.g. leasing, car, technical equipment)\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI052_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI053\nHousehold has home-related credit/loans (inventory, domestic appliances, repairs)\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI053_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI054\nHousehold has credit/loans to pay for holidays/leisure\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI054_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI055\nHousehold has credit/loans to pay for education or childcare\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI055_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI056\nHousehold has credit/loans to pay for health issues\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI056_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI057\nHousehold has credit/loans for investment or business start-up\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI057_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nMI058\nHousehold has other cash loans (debt conversion, to cover overdraft, credit card and other bills, etc.)\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI058_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (MI050=2)\nArrears\nMI060\nArrears on other non-housing household bills\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI060_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no other non-housing household bills)\nMI065\nEstimated total amount currently in arrears for other non-housing household bills in classes\n1-9\nClass\nMI065_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no arrears currently (MI060=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no other non-housing household bills (MI060_F=-2))\nMI075\nEstimated total amount currently in arrears for household housing bills/repayments in classes\n1-9\nClass\nMI075_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no arrears currently (HS010=2 and HS020=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no housing household bills/repayments (HS010_F=-2 and HS020_F=-2))\nMI085\nEstimated total amount currently in arrears for household other loans and credit repayment in classes\n1-9\nClass\nMI085_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no arrears currently (HS030=2 or current amount owed is zero) or no other loans and credit repayment (HS030_F=-2))\nDrop in income\nMI090\nMajor drop in household income during the last 12 months\n1\nYes\n2\nNo\nMI090_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\nMI095\nMain reason for drop in income\n1\nJob loss/redundancy\n2\nChange in hours worked and/or in wages\n3\nInability to work through sickness or disability\n4\nMaternity — parental leave — childcare\n5\nRetirement\n6\nMarriage/relationship breakdown\n7\nOther change in household composition\n8\nOther reason\nMI095_F\n1\nVariable is filled\n-1\nMissing\n-2\nN/A (no drop in income (MI090=2))\nFuture expectations\nMI100\nExpectation of financial situation in the next 12 months;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (1), and in particular Article 37(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 contains two lists of harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances. Table 3.1 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Parts 2 to 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Table 3.2 lists the harmonised classification and labelling of hazardous substances based on the criteria set out in Annex VI to Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (2). Those two lists need to be amended to include updated classifications for substances already subject to those harmonised classifications and to include new harmonised classifications.
(2) The Committee for Risk Assessment of the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) has issued opinions on proposals for harmonised classification and labelling of substances which had been submitted to ECHA pursuant to Article 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. Based on those opinions, as well as on the comments received from the parties concerned, it is appropriate to amend Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 in order to harmonise the classification and labelling of certain substances.
(3) The harmonised classifications set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as amended by this Regulation, should not apply immediately, as a certain period of time will be necessary to allow operators to adapt the labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures to the new classifications and to sell existing stocks. In addition, a certain period of time will be necessary to allow operators to comply with the registration obligations resulting from the new harmonised classifications for substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, categories 1A and 1B (Table 3.1) and categories 1 and 2 (Table 3.2), or as very toxic to aquatic organisms which may cause long term effects in the aquatic environment, in particular with those set out in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (3).
(4) In line with the transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 which allow the application of the new provisions at an earlier stage on a voluntary basis, suppliers should have the possibility of applying the harmonised classifications set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008, as amended by this Regulation, and of adapting the labelling and packaging accordingly on a voluntary basis before 1 December 2013.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 of 16 January 2008 fixing for 2008 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of point 8.7 of Annex IIA thereto,
Having regard to the request made by the United Kingdom,
Whereas:
(1) Points 8 and 14 of Annex IIA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 specify the maximum allowable fishing effort by defining maximum number of days at sea for which Community vessels of length overall equal to or greater than 10 metres carrying on board certain types of gear may be present within certain areas ranging from the Kattegat to the west of Scotland.
(2) Point 8.5 of that Annex enables a Member State to manage, during the 2008 management period, its fishing effort allocations according to a kilowatt-day system. Such a management system allows allocating to fishing vessels a maximum number of days at sea different from those set out in that Annex, provided that the overall amounts of kilowatt-days corresponding to the combination of gear grouping and operational area to which the vessels belong is respected.
(3) Point 8.6 of that Annex specifies that such a reallocation of days at sea shall be made with a view to a more efficient use of fishing opportunities or in order to stimulate fishing practices that lead to reduced discards and lower fishing mortality of both juvenile and adult fish.
(4) Point 8.7 of that Annex provides the level of data detail that is requested from a Member State wishing to obtain the Commission’s authorisation for implementing such an alternative fishing effort management system.
(5) The United Kingdom has submitted a request to the Commission with letters dated 14 April, 2 May and 22 July, and with electronically formatted reports sent May, August and September 2008 as regards such an alternative management system in the United Kingdom, applying to fishing vessels using trawls or Danish seines with a mesh size of either between 70 and 89 mm or of 100 mm and more, operating in EC waters of the Norwegian Sea, the North Sea or to the west of Scotland (ICES areas IIa, IVa to IVc or VIa). That request and reports contained the information and data required under point 8.7 of Annex IIA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008, in particular about the scope, outline, calculation, operation, monitoring and evaluation of that system.
(6) The United Kingdom’s system applies initially to 867 vessels. Their aggregated effort maxima during the 2008 management period are 21 095 690 kilowatt-days for the gear groupings in the range of 70 to 89 mm mesh size operating in any of the areas mentioned, and 27 867 735 kilowatt-days for the gear groupings in a range of 100 mm or more mesh size operating in any of the areas mentioned. In view of the lower amount of days at sea available to the gear groupings of mesh sizes ranging from 100 mm when operating to the west of Scotland, a sub-ceiling of 24 622 862 kilowatt-days is applicable to their fishing trips to the west of Scotland. Therefore, the conditions provided for in point 8.5 of Annex IIA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 are fulfilled by that system.
(7) The Commission has evaluated that system and concluded that it serves the objectives set out in point 8.6 of Annex IIA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008. The system reallocates the days with a view to more efficient use of fishing opportunities and in order to stimulate fishing practices that lead to reduced discards and lower fishing mortality of both juvenile and adult fish as required under that point. Moreover, under that system, the participating vessels are obliged to support specific conservation measures. These differ slightly in concept and importance according to the regions, and comprise the following components: respecting real-time area closures that have been established upon the detection of cod aggregations; using larger square mesh panels in order to increase whitefish selectivity; taking part in trials for more selective gears; and using only one gear instead of several during a trip. The impact of these measures will have to be evaluated at a later stage.
(8) One of the incentives for fishermen to participate in the system is the allocation of steady effort compared to the management period 2007, known as ‘conservation credits’ in Scotland, despite the reduction in maximum number of days at sea that apply to trawlers in the North Sea and to the west of Scotland for the management period 2008.
(9) Therefore the United Kingdom’s effort pool system of management in EC waters of ICES areas IIa, IVa to IVc and VIa, fishing effort of trawls, Danish seines and similar gears, except beam trawls, of mesh size either equal to or larger than 70 mm and less than 90 mm or equal to or larger than 100 mm by way of allocating and monitoring kilowatt-days should be authorised for the management period 2008,","{'header': '31.12.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 352/36', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 9 December 2008\nauthorising the United Kingdom to benefit from a provision laid down in point 8.5 of Annex IIA to Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 as regards a fishing effort pool system for trawlers and similar fishing vessels operating in the North Sea and to the west of Scotland\n(notified under document number C(2008) 7801)\n(Only the English text is authentic)\n(2008/983/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Points 8 and 14 of Annex IIA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 specify the maximum allowable fishing effort by defining maximum number of days at sea for which Community vessels of length overall equal to or greater than 10 metres carrying on board certain types of gear may be present within certain areas ranging from the Kattegat to the west of Scotland.\n\n((2)) Point 8.5 of that Annex enables a Member State to manage, during the 2008 management period, its fishing effort allocations according to a kilowatt-day system.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand and Turkey (‘the product concerned’).
(2) The Commission, by Decision 2001/602/EC (3), accepted price undertakings offered by Open Joint Stock Company Cherepovetsky Staleprokatny Zavod, Russia (‘ChSPZ’) and Usha Siam Steel Ind., Public Company Ltd, Thailand (‘Usha Siam’).
(3) On 10 August 2004, the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as ChSPZ and another Russian producer are concerned (4).
(4) As explained in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (5), ChSPZ's name was changed to Closed Joint Stock Company Severstal-Metiz, applicable as of 1 January 2006.
(5) On 3 August 2006, the Commission initiated an expiry review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 (6).
(6) On 22 March 2007 (7), the Commission initiated a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 limited in scope to the examination of dumping as far as Usha Siam is concerned.
(7) All three investigations have been concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 (8) which imposed with certain amendments to the level of the duties the measures for Russia and repealed the measures for Thailand and Turkey.
B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING OF CLOSED JOINT STOCK COMPANY SEVERTAL-METIZ, RUSSIA
(8) As set out in recital 199-203 of Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 and after having consulted all parties concerned, the undertaking of Closed Joint Stock Company Severstal-Metiz in its current form is not appropriate to counteract the injurious effect of dumping, since it presents considerable monitoring and enforcement difficulties.
(9) The interim review revealed that since the acceptance of the undertaking in 2001 the product range of SSM had changed significantly.
(10) The undertaking classified the SWR produced by them in a considerable number of product types with significant price variations within each type. The review investigation confirmed that the company had serious problems in classifying the different product types properly and in accordance with the terms of the undertaking. This was partly due to accounting system limitations which did not allow them to properly distinguish between different SWR product types. Similar problems were already identified during the monitoring of the undertaking and led to a warning letter.
(11) It has therefore been concluded that the undertaking in its current form is no longer workable.
(12) On this basis and in accordance with the relevant clauses of the undertaking, which authorise the Commission to unilaterally withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking, the Commission has decided to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking.
(13) The Commission informed the Russian authorities and the Russian exporting producer concerned that it proposed to withdraw the acceptance of the current undertaking. The interested parties were given the opportunity to comment.
C.   REPEAL OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING OF USHA SIAM STEEL IND. PUBLIC COMPANY LTD., THAILAND
(14) In the light of the findings regarding Thailand and as set out in recital 209 of Regulation (EC) No 1279/2007 anti-dumping measures against imports of the product concerned originating in this country are repealed.
(15) As a consequence, the undertaking offered by Usha Siam should be repealed.

Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 stipulates that, for the period 1 January to 31 March, carrots, falling within subheading ex 07.01 G II of the Common Customs Tariff, and, for the period 15 February to 15 May, onions, falling within subheading ex 07.01 H of the Common Customs Tariff and originating in the countries in question are subject on importation into the Community to the reduced rates of duty of 10,2 and 4,8 % respectively; whereas such reduction of duties applies only to imports up to ceilings of 500 tonnes for each of these products above which the customs duties actually applicable to third countries are reintroduced;
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible reintroduction of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to reintroduce customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2351/2001(4), lays down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, to apply from 1 July 2001, with a view to the management of the tariff import quotas provided for in Article 18(1) of the latter Regulation.
(2) Article 18(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2587/2001, amends the tariff import quotas from 1 January 2002. In particular it reduces tariff quota C by 100000 tonnes and reserves access to it for products originating in the ACP countries. As a result of those amendments, it should be borne in mind that the structures of the trade in products originating in the ACP countries feature greater integration of the various commercial operations, which are carried out to a large extent by traditional operators as defined in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001. In order to ensure the continuity of import flows and at the same time to allocate non-traditional operators a share of tariff quota C that enables them to continue their activities in this trade and in order to foster sound competition, the allocation of tariff quota C among traditional and non-traditional operators should be adjusted and Article 2 of the abovementioned Regulation should be amended accordingly. The new allocation should correspond more closely to the operations actually carried out by each of the two categories of operators over the last three years.
(3) The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 lists the authorities competent in the Member States to issue licences for importing bananas from third countries. Following notifications from several Member States, that Annex should be amended.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in May 1998 Germany received an application from Menno Chemie Vertriebsgesellschaft mbH for the inclusion of the active substance benzoic acid in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 98/676/EC(3) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to the Directive.
(2) The Netherlands received a similar application in March 1997 from Luxan BV concerning carvone. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 1999/610/EC(4).
(3) Italy received a similar application in October 1997 from Kumiai Chemical Industry Co., Ltd concerning mepanipyrim. This dossier was also declared complete by Decision 98/676/EC.
(4) Furthermore, Italy received a similar application in June 1997 from RhĂ´ne Poulenc Agro SpA (now Bayer Crop Sciences) concerning oxadiargyl. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 98/398/EC(5).
(5) The United Kingdom received a similar application in January 1998 from Novartis Crop Protection UK Ltd (now Syngenta) concerning trifloxystrobin. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 1999/43/EC(6).
(6) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive.
(7) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the respective applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 12 December 2000 for benzoic acid, on 16 October 2000 for carvone, on 12 July 2000 for mepanipyrim, on 20 July 1999 for oxadiargyl, and on 19 September 2000 for trifloxystrobin.
(8) It will not be possible to complete the evaluation of the dossiers within the timeframe set by the relevant decisions on completeness, because the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States.
(9) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed within 24 months.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 736/96 of 22 April 1996 on notifying the Commission of investment projects of interest to the Community in the petroleum, natural gas and electricity sectors
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 187 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, for the sake of clarity, on the occasion of new amendments, it is necessary to reformulate Council Regulation (EEC) No 1056/72 of 18 May 1972 on notifying the Commission of investment projects of interest to the Community in the petroleum, natural gas and electricity sectors (4);
Whereas the introduction of a common energy policy is one of the objectives which the Community has set itself; whereas it is the task of the Commission to propose the measures to be taken for this purpose;
Whereas the information gathered pursuant to the said Regulation is necessary for the Commission's ongoing activities and whereas these data are the Commission's only official source of information on developments in production, processing and transmission capacity in the electricity, petroleum and natural gas sectors;
Whereas, after studying the communication made to it by the Commission on 18 December 1968 on initial guidelines for a Community energy policy, the Council, during its 88th meeting held on 13 November 1969:
- approved the basic principles of that communication in the light of the report from the Permanent Representatives Committee,
- requested the Commission to put before it as soon as possible the most urgent concrete proposals in this field,
- agreed to study these proposals as soon as possible in order to establish a Community energy policy;
Whereas obtaining an overall picture of the development of investments in the Community is one feature of such a policy, in particular in order to enable the Community to make the necessary comparisons;
Whereas the accomplishment of that task requires the most accurate information possible on investments; whereas, with regard to coal and atomic energy, undertakings are under an obligation, pursuant to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, to notify their investment projects; whereas it is desirable to supplement such information with particulars relating to petroleum, natural gas and electricity; whereas, to this end, the Commission should be informed of investment projects which are of interest to the Community in the sectors concerned;
Whereas, so that the Commission may carry out its task, it should also be informed in good time of any fundamental alteration in such projects, in particular as regards the period required for carrying them out and the planned capacity; whereas, as a result, communication of such particulars is similarly indispensable;
Whereas Member States should for this purpose communicate to the Commission, with any comments they may have, particulars of investment projects concerning production, storage and distribution of petroleum, natural gas or electric power planned in their territory; whereas to this end the persons and undertakings concerned must be under an obligation to communicate to the Member State the information in question;
Whereas some Member States have no need to maintain this obligation on the persons and undertakings concerned in order to ascertain the investment projects which must subsequently be notified to the Commission;
Whereas, because of the technical, financial, industrial and social aspects of investment projects in the electricity sector, there is a growing tendency to formulate such projects at least five years before the expected commencement of work;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to ensure that the Commission is notified of investment projects in the electricity sector on which work is expected to commence within five years of 1 January of the current year;
Whereas, in the case of petroleum refining, investment in desulphurization plants for residues, gas oil, feedstock or other petroleum products is of increasing importance in view of the strict quality standards to be adopted within the Community in order to control pollution;
Whereas Article 41 and 42 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community provide that the Commission must receive notification of any kind of nuclear investment project not later than three months before the first contracts are concluded with the suppliers or three months before the works begins; whereas this means that in fact notification of projects is given when they are at a very advanced stage and then only at the initiative of and on the date chosen by the person or undertaking making the investment;
Whereas, in order to assist manufacturing industry in undertaking the investment and adjustments necessary for the supply of heavy plant under the investment programmes relating to electric power supplies, the Commission must be informed of the projects involved in these programmes sufficiently far in advance of their implementation to be able to provide industry with information - the exact form varying according to the degree of final commitment reached with regard to the construction plans - which will enable an accurate assessment to be made of the technical, financial and social risks involved;
Whereas, in the electricity and natural gas sectors, investment projects relating respectively to underground and submarine transmission cables and gas pipelines, which constitute essential links in national or international interconnecting networks as well as in the trans-European networks, are of interest to the Community; whereas the Commission needs information on such projects to enable it to carry out its task in the electricity and natural gas sectors; whereas provision should be made to ensure that such projects are communicated to the Commission;
Whereas experience has shown that the dates of 15 February and 15 January leave the persons and undertakings concerned and the Member States insufficient time to collect the information necessary;
Whereas it is desirable to enable the Commission to prescribe, where appropriate, certain practical details, such as the form and content of the notifications to be made;
Whereas experience has shown that some of the data collected impose administrative constraints which go further than necessary, in relation to the advantages which can be expected; whereas it is necessary to reduce and change the data collected;
Whereas observance of the obligations provided for in this Regulation and the confidential nature of the information collected should be ensured,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 736/96 of 22 April 1996 on notifying the Commission of investment projects of interest to the Community in the petroleum, natural gas and electricity sectors', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 14 July  1995 suspending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain types of electronic  microcircuits known as EPROMs (erasable programmable read only memories) originating in Japan  (95/272/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of 22 December 1994 on protection against  dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community  (1), and in particular Article  14 (4) thereof,
After consultation with the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1)  The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 577/91  (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No  2860/93  (3) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of certain types  of electronic microcircuits known as EPROMs (erasable programmable read only memories) originating  in Japan, and falling under CN codes:
-  8542  11  33, 8542  11  34, 8542  11  35 or 8542  11  36 for finished UV erasable EPROMs,
-  ex  8542  11  38 for finished Flash E2PROMs,
-  ex  8542  11  76 for OTPs,
-  ex  8542  11  01 for wafers for all types of EPROMs and -  ex  8542  11  05 for dice and chips for all types of EPROMs.
(2)  The basic anti-dumping Regulation, i.e. Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 at Article 14 (4)  provides for the suspension of anti-dumping measures imposed on the grounds that market conditions  have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such a  suspension. Article 14 (4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be  reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.
(3)  As in the case of another type of electronic microcircuit, i.e. DRAMs  (4), since the end of  1993 and the beginning of 1994, due to a strong and growing demand for EPROMs , in particular by  telecommunication equipment manufacturers, prices of EPROMs, on a world-wide basis, have remained  stable.
With respect to the Community market in particular, the Commission has been able to follow  developments as almost all known Japanese EPROM producers supply the Commission on a regular basis  with their detailed sales reports pursuant to undertakings which the Commission has accepted in the  framework of the abovementioned anti-dumping proceeding  (5). An analysis of these reports has  confirmed that the market behaviour of the exporters concerned is in line with the general  evaluation of price developments made by market research companies, some of which monitor the  semiconductor market particularly closely.
(4)  With regard to the situation of the Community EPROM industry, the Commission has furthermore  received information confirming that this industry has also benefited from the current market  situation. Indeed, following the stabilization of the situation of the Community industry  concurrently with the introduction of the above anti-dumping measures and following the substantial  investments made for the production of the newest generations of EPROMs the Community industry's  revenues stemming from an increase in EPROM sales volumes and in EPROM prices have had the effect  that the Community industry is no longer suffering financial losses on current sales, but rather  generating increased returns.
(5)  The anti-dumping duty was imposed in order to underpin the undertakings and in order to ensure  that imports of any EPROMs outside the scope of the undertakings would not be made at an injurious  price level. The present market situation is one of strong demand, where market forces are  sustaining a level of prices for EPROMs which is at or above the prices at which the above  companies have undertaken to sell in the Community. It appears therefore that the absence of  injurious dumping of EPROMs on the Community market at present is not dependent on the maintenance  of the anti-dumping measures. Whilst the minimum prices applicable pursuant to the undertakings  have been overtaken by market prices, the continued existence of the ad valorem anti-dumping duty  constitutes an unnecessary barrier to entry to the Community market for EPROMs not covered by an  undertaking.
(6)  However, based on previous experience gained in the EPROM-market, it appears reasonable to  conclude that this development in prices may well be temporary. Indeed, the EPROM-market is a  cyclical market characterised by sharp up and downturns in prices. The likelihood that current  market conditions are a temporary phenomenon leads to the conclusion that this situation should be  dealt with by a temporary suspension of the anti-dumping duty.
(7)  In conclusion, the Commission considers that all requirements to suspend the anti-dumping duty  concerned pursuant to Article 14 (4) are met and that therefore this duty should be suspended for a  period of nine months. This conclusion has been reached on the basis of:
-  reliable sales information collected in the course of the anti-dumping proceeding concerned,  reflecting market prices in the Community,
-  the overall situation of the world EPROM market which, given the extensive market research data  available, is inherently transparent, and -  experience of the cyclical nature of this industry.
(8)  The Commission will continue to closely monitor the development of the EPROM market and the  behaviour of individual market participants, in particular with respect to the newest generation of  EPROMs. Should a situation arise in which a resumption of injury to the Community industry occurs,  the Commission will reinstate the above anti-dumping measures without delay.
(9)  To this end, the obligation to submit reports on sales and prices pursuant to the undertakings  will enable the Commission to monitor the EPROM market. However, the Commission considers that,  during the period of the suspension of the anti-dumping duty, the obligation to adhere to the  minimum price provisions of these undertakings should be discontinued. The quarterly calculation  and communication of such prices to these companies by the Commission will therefore be  discontinued during this period.
(10)  In accordance with the provisions of Article 14 (4) of the basic Regulation the Commission  has informed the complainant of its intention to suspend the above anti-dumping measures and has  provided it with an opportunity to comment. These comments have been taken into account reaching  the present decision.
(11)  The Advisory Committee was consulted on the suspension of the anti-dumping measures and  raised no objections,",{'title': '95/272/EC: Commission Decision of 14 July 1995 suspending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain types of electronic microcircuits known as EPROMs (erasable programmable read only memories) originating in Japan'}

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) The safety of Community shipping and of citizens using it and the protection of the environment should be ensured at all times.
(2) In respect of international shipping a comprehensive framework enhancing maritime safety and the protection of the environment with regard to pollution from ships has been set up through the adoption of a number of conventions for which the International Maritime Organisation (hereinafter the IMO) is the depository.
(3) Under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982 (UNCLOS) and of the conventions for which IMO is the depository (hereinafter the IMO Conventions), the States which are party to those instruments are responsible for promulgating laws and regulations and for taking all other steps which may be necessary to give those instruments full and complete effect so as to ensure that, from the point of view of safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment, a ship is fit for the service for which it is intended and is manned with competent maritime personnel.
(4) Due account has to be taken of the Maritime Labour Convention, adopted by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2006, which also addresses flag State-related obligations.
(5) On 9 October 2008, the Member States adopted a statement in which they unanimously recognised the importance of the application of the international conventions related to flag States obligations in order to improve maritime safety and to contribute to preventing pollution by ships.
(6) Implementation of the procedures recommended by the IMO in MSC/Circ.1140/MEPC/Circ.424 of 20 December 2004 on the transfer of ships between States should strengthen the provisions of the IMO Conventions and Community maritime safety legislation relating to a change of flag and should increase transparency in the relationship between flag States, in the interests of maritime safety.
(7) The availability of information on ships flying the flag of a Member State, as well as on ships which have left a register of a Member State, should improve the transparency of the performance of a high-quality fleet and contribute to better monitoring of flag State obligations and to ensuring a level playing field between administrations.
(8) In order to help Member States in further improving their performance as flag States, they should have their administration audited on a regular basis.
(9) A quality certification of administrative procedures in accordance with the standards of the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) or equivalent standards should further ensure a level playing field between administrations.
(10) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4).
(11) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the introduction and implementation of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Italian Government submitted to the Commission on 27 November 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the Autonomous Region of Valle d'Aosta fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The plan includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other financial instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.

Whereas:
(1) The purpose of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 is to ensure that proper and effective measures are taken to detect and control salmonella and other zoonotic agents at all relevant stages of production, processing and distribution, particularly at the level of primary production, in order to reduce their prevalence and the risk they pose to public health.
(2) A Community target was established for the reduction of the prevalence of all salmonella serotypes with public health significance in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus at the level of primary production by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1003/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 as regards a Community target for the reduction of the prevalence of certain salmonella serotypes in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus and amending Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 (2).
(3) In order to achieve the Community target Member States are to establish national programmes for the control of salmonella in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus and submit them to the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003.
(4) Certain Member States have submitted their national programmes for the control of salmonella in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus.

(6) Following the occurrence of cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the health measures taken by the authorities of certain third countries in regard to exports of bovine animals and their meat have seriously affected the financial interests of exporters.

(7) It is therefore necessary to limit the adverse impact on exporters by adopting special provisions, notably the extension of certain time limits set in the refund rules, applying to export operations that in these circumstances it has not been possible to complete.
(8) These provisions should benefit only operators who can show on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(14), that they have in the circumstances been unable to export and that their licences were requested in order to export to the countries that have adopted the health measures in question.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the notification and application for negative clearance submitted on 11 April 1975 relating to the articles of association and the rules and regulations of the GAFTA Soya Bean Meal Futures Association Limited,
Having regard to the summary of the notification published (2) pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
I. FACTS
(1) The GAFTA (3) Soya Bean Meal Futures Association Limited (SOMFA) is one of many commodity markets established in London. The commodity markets are self-regulatory organizations run by committees of management selected by members from amongst themselves, aided by secretariats and using powers given to them by their members in market rule books. Although the markets are self-regulating, there is an element of supervision by the Bank of England and, increasingly, supervision of the members by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers Limited (AFBD).
(2) The object of SOMFA is to set up and to administer a terminal market in London for soya bean meal. A terminal market, or a futures market, provides organized facilities for concluding contracts for the purchase and sale of a commodity to be delivered at named future dates. Futures markets have been developed primarily to enable persons involved in commodity trading to protect themselves from the risks of adverse price movements.
(3) SOMFA provides a market floor for trading and price-making, determines various technical questions such as allowable delivery months and standard contract terms and procures the provision of clearing and settlement facilities. Trading is done on the floor of the market where dealers face each other in a ring, making bids and offers through the system known as 'open outcry'.
(4) The International Futures Markets in London are among the principal markets used in international commodity merchandising, and they contribute to the stability and smooth operation of world trade and to world pricing mechanisms. The relative size of SOMFA compared with its most important competitors is shown below:
Annual volumes of trade (tonnes traded) in soya bean meal
1982 to 1985
1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Year   // London  // Chicago (100 tonnes)   // Hong Kong (30 tonnes)  // Mid-America (20 tonnes)   //    //   //   //   //   // 1982   // 3 842 500   //   //   //   // 1983   // 4 466 100   //  //   //   // 1984   // 2 493 760   // 3 822 179   // 340 545  // 10 981   // 1985   // 2 078 500   // 3 339 268   // 372 352   //   //    //   //   //   //
N.B: Data for London include the 20 tonnes soya bean meal contract which commenced trading on 8 May 1984 (the current contract); the 100 tonnes, sterling soya bean meal contract traded up to 31 December 1984; and the 100 tonnes US Dollar soya bean meal contract traded from 1 July 1983 to 22 August 1984.
(5) The contract currently traded on the soya bean meal market is for 20 tonnes, or multiples of 20 tonnes, of soya bean meal/pellets of a quality defined in detail in Rule 13.05 of SOMFA's rules. The contract is for delivery of each 20 tonnes in one of the stores approved by SOMFA in either the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands or the United Kingdom at the seller's option. Quotations are for one year ahead and the months for trading are December, February, April, June, August and October.
(6) All contracts traded on SOMFA must be registered with the International Commodities Clearing House Limited (ICCH), an independent service company, which provides clearing and settlement facilities for SOMFA. ICCH has substantial capital and reserves, and is wholly owned by six clearing banks. The principal functions of ICCH are to maintain and organize a 'daily clearing' of all trades and provide a guarantee for due fulfilment of contracts, in accordance with the rules of SOMFA, to clearing members in whose names such contracts are registered.
(7) There are three classes of membership of SOMFA. The first class is of voting members known as floor members. Floor members are allowed to trade on the floor of the market. The rules set no limit to the number of floor members. The second two classes of non-voting or associate members consist of trade associate members and general associate members. Their number is similarly not limited. Non-voting members have to pass all contracts through a floor member.
(8) The criteria specified in the Articles for floor members require an applicant for membership to meet certain financial requirements. A detailed statement of the criteria in force at the time of application may be obtained from the Secretary. To become a floor member the applicant must satisfy the Committee that it is carrying on business from a properly-established office in London, and that it is actively interested in the trading of soya bean meal. Firms and companies whose principal place of business is not within the member countries of the EEC are not eligible for floor membership.
(9) All floor members must be members of the ICCH and must register their contracts with the ICCH which, in return for its fee, guarantees the performance of the contracts.
(10) Trade associate members are companies or firms which have a continuing interest in the production, trading or consumption of physical soya bean meal. General associate members consist of companies or firms which have a continuing trading interest in the soya bean meal futures market.
(11) Floor membership may be transferred provided that the transferee is elected in accordance with the Articles. Associate membership may also be transferred in accordance with SOMFA's rules.
(12) The Committee is now required to give reasons when it takes decisions affecting the members' rights of membership. An appeal procedure applies if the Committee refuses an application for membership, refuses to grant permission for a transfer of membership, or refuses to approve a change in the directorship, partnership, nature of business, legal status or beneficial ownership of a member. The procedure also applies if the Committee suspends a member for more than seven days, or refuses to reinstate a member, or expels a member or otherwise determines that a membership shall cease. In these cases, if the candidate or member is dissatisfied with the Committee's decision, that candidate or member may ask the Committee to reconsider its decision, making such representations and supplying such information as it considers relevant.
(13) The rules require that a member must generally be a member of the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers Limited (AFBD). However, this requirement is not mandatory for all members. A member is excused from this obligation if he is (a) not a floor member and has no place of business in the UK, or (b) engages in business exclusively on his own account or on behalf of a related company, or (c) falls within a category of member which is excused membership of the AFBD by the AFBD itself. The AFBD is one of seven self-regulatory organizations (SROs) which it is expected will be recognized by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), which was set up in anticipation of the Financial Services Act which stipulates that the only persons allowed to carry on investment business in the UK are 'authorized persons' or certain 'exempted persons'. Members of the SOMFA will be so authorized by virtue of being members of the AFBD. In order to become a member of the AFBD applicants have to fulfil certain qualitative criteria which reflect the AFBD's primary object, i.e. to promote and maintain a system of supervision of the conduct of business by commodity, financial and other futures brokers and dealers, particularly with a view to the protection of the interests of their clients. These criteria relate to the suitability of members' financial and business standing, and eligibility in other respects such as reliability, training, experience and financial resources.
(14) The rules provide that 'a' commission must be charged by every member on every transaction effected for another party (whether or not that other party is a member), but the rates of commission are freely negotiable. Where a member adopts a different position in two adjacent trading months ('a straddle') these may be executed for one commission provided that both positions are closed simultaneously.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
(15) The notified rules and regulations of SOMFA are to be considered as agreements within the meaning of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty.
(16) The articles, rules and regulations of the SOMFA were drawn up taking into account the representations by the Commission in relation to various other terminal markets in London. The Commission has already granted negative clearance in respect of the rules of these associations by Decisions 85/563/EEC (1) (sugar), 85/564/EEC (2) (cocoa), 85/565/EEC (3) (coffee) and 85/566/EEC (4) (rubber).
(17) The rules and regulations as originally notified specified the minimum net rates of commission which could be charged by a member. The rules specified rates of commission which varied according to who was paying and who was receiving the commission, and whether or not the contract was registered in the client's own name. The rates were cheaper if the contract was registered in the client's own name with the ICCH. They were also lower where the payer was a full member than where the payer was an associate member. The highest rate of commission applied where the payer was a non-member.
(18) The rules specified that the rates of commission were the minimum net rates which could be charged by members, and that no portion of this commission could be returned by a member to his client or agent in any shape or form, whether directly or indirectly. The Committee was given powers to examine suspected infringements and had the power to suspend or expel offending members.
(19) The Commission considered this system of specified minimum commission rates to be a form of price-fixing and that it violated Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty. SOMFA was requested to abandon the system of fixed minimum rates. The system has now been completely abolished and references to the system in the rules and regulations have been deleted. The rules now provide that 'a' commission must be charged by every member on every transaction effected for another party (whether or not that other party is a member) but the rates of commission are freely negotiable. The Commission believes that this obligation is not appreciably restrictive of competition because it only entails the obligation to charge 'a' commission, without any reference to the commission which is to be charged. It follows that complete freedom exists to negotiate the actual commission rates.
(20) Furthermore, as a result of the representations by the Commission, amendments have been made to the rules concerning membership so that membership is now open, and the criteria by which applications for membership are judged are objective (see Facts, paragraph 8 above). The Committee is now required to give reasons when it takes decisions affecting the members' rights of membership. To protect the rights of actual or potential members an appeal procedure has been introduced.
(21) The publications in the Official Journal of the European Communities, pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17, did not elicit any representations.
(22) The articles of association and the rules and regulations of SOMFA as outlined above do not contain any clauses which constitute appreciable restrictions on competition within the common market. Therefore the Commission, on the basis of the facts in its possession, has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1). Consequently, the Commission is able to issue a negative clearance pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation No 17,","{'title': '87/44/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 December 1986 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/29.036 - The GAFTA Soya Bean Meal Futures Association) (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nOn the basis of the facts in its possession the Commission has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the articles of association and rules and regulations of the GAFTA Soya Bean Meal Futures Association as notified on 11 April 1975.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to The GAFTA Soya Bean Meal Futures Association Limited, whose registered office is at Baltic Exchange Chambers, 24/28 St Mary Axe, London EC 3 A 8EP, United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 December 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPeter SUTHERLAND\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No 13, 21. 2. 1962, p. 204/62.\n\n(2) OJ No C 251, 8. 10. 1986, p. 10.\n\n(3) 'GAFTA' means Grain and Feed Trade Association.\n\n(1) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 25.\n\n(2) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 28.\n\n(3) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 31.\n\n(4) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 34.""}]}"

Having regard to the proposals from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Work on the internal market should gradually improve the quality of life, health protection and consumer safety. The measures provided for in this Directive ensure a high level of health and consumer protection.
(2) Textile and leather articles containing certain azodyes have the capacity to release certain arylamines, which may pose cancer risks.
(3) Limitations already adopted or planned by certain Member States on the use of azodyed textile and leather articles concern the completion and functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and, consequently, to amend Annex I to Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations(4).
(4) The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE), after being consulted by the Commission, has confirmed that cancer risks posed by textile and leather goods coloured by certain azodyes, give cause for concern.
(5) In order to protect human health, the use of dangerous azodyes and the placing on the market of some articles coloured with such dyes should be prohibited.
(6) For textile articles made of recycled fibres, a maximum concentration of 70 ppm for the amines listed in point 43 in the appendix to Directive 76/769/EEC should be applied. This should be the case for a transitional period until 1 January 2005 if the amines are released by the residues deriving from the previous dyeing of the same fibres. This will allow for the recycling of textiles, which has overall benefits for the environment.
(7) Harmonised testing methods are necessary for the application of this Directive. The Commission, in accordance with Article 2a of Directive 76/769/EEC, should establish such methods. The testing methods should preferably be developed at European level, if appropriate by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN).
(8) In the light of new scientific knowledge, testing methods should be reviewed, including testing methods for analysing 4-amino azobenzene.
(9) In the light of new scientific knowledge, the provisions on certain azocolourants should be reviewed, in particular with regard to the need to include other materials not covered by this Directive, as well as other aromatic amines. Special attention should be paid to possible risks to children.
(10) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC(5) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC(6) and Directive 98/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7),","{'title': 'Directive 2002/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 amending for the nineteenth time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (azocolourants)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex I to Directive 76/769/EEC is hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nTesting methods for the application of point 43 of Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2a of that Directive.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas artichokes harvested during a given crop year are marketed from October to September of the following year; whereas the quantities harvested in the months July to October are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these months; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 1 November up to and including 30 June of the following year;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal price variations into account, the marketing year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;

Whereas, in accordance with Article 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first stage of accession;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 of 15 December 1994 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Articles 3, 4 and 7 thereof,
Whereas, because of concerns for the ozone layer, the Community has already phased out the production and consumption of certain controlled substances;
Whereas essential uses have to be decided for chlorofluorocarbons (Articles 3(1) and 4(1)); other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons (Articles 3(2) and 4(2)); halons (Articles 3(3) and 4(3)); carbon tetrachloride (Articles 3(4) and 4(4)); 1,1,1-trichloroethane (Articles 3(5) and 4(5)); and HBFCs (Articles 3(7) and 4(7));
Whereas the criteria used for assessing essential uses are in line with Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol and are as follows:
1. that a use of a controlled substance should qualify as 'essential` only if:
(a) it is necessary for the health, safety, or is critical for the functioning of society (encompassing cultural and intellectual aspects); and
(b) there are no technically and economically feasible alternatives or substitutes that are acceptable from the standpoint of environment and health;
2. that production and consumption, if any, of a controlled substance for essential uses should be permitted only if:
(a) all economically feasible steps have been taken to minimise the essential use and any associated emission of the controlled substance; and
(b) the controlled substance is not available in sufficient quantity and quality from existing stocks of banked or recycled controlled substances, also bearing in mind the needs of developing countries for controlled substances;
Whereas Decision IX/18 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the levels of production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances for metered dose inhalers (MDIs) for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD);
Whereas Decision IX/17 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the seventh meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the sixth meeting of the Parties and in Decision VII/11;
Whereas the Commission has published a notice (2) to those companies in the European Community which use controlled substances that may be allowed for essential uses in the Community in 1999 pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94, and has thereby received applications for quantities of controlled substances for essential uses in 1999;
Whereas, in the framework of the Montreal Protocol nomination and assessment procedures for essential uses, Parties are requested to identify the users who may take advantage of essential uses in 1999;
Whereas the Commission issues licenses to the users identified pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 7 and in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94;
Whereas, within this framework, a producer may be authorised by the competent authority of the Member State in which its relevant production is situated to produce the controlled substances for the purposes of meeting the licensed demands presented by the identified users; whereas the competent authority of the Member State concerned shall in turn notify the Commission well in advance of any such authorisation;

Trans-European telecommunications networks will contribute to the introduction of innovative trans-European services in the general interest. The services will contribute to the development of the information society in terms of growth, employment, social cohesion and participation for all in the knowledge-based economy.\n\n2. TEN-Telecom supports the technical and economic feasibility, validation and deployment of services. Services must be innovative, trans-European and based on proven technology:\n\n- a service may be launched in separate Member States with appropriate adaptation in each State,\n\n- a service that has already been deployed in a single Member State without support under this programme may be extended to other Member States,\n\n- a service of demonstrably trans-European interest may be implemented in a single Member State.\n\n3. As services should be considered to be trans-European, the participation of organisations from more than one Member State and implementation in more than one Member State, though not required, will be encouraged.\n\n4. In this context, projects of common interest shall be identified on the basis of their operational capability to support the objectives laid down in this Decision.\n\n5. The projects of common interest described below shall be on three levels, forming a coherent structure.\n\n(i) Applications\n\nApplications serve user needs, taking into account cultural and linguistic differences and the requirements for accessibility, in particular for disabled people. Where it is applicable, they shall accommodate the specific needs of less developed or less populated regions. They shall use the potential of broadband, mobile and other communications networks as appropriate.\n\n(ii) Generic Services\n\nGeneric Services shall support applications\' common requirements by providing common tools for the development and implementation of new applications based on interoperable standards. They shall provide services for the transfer and integrity of data across networks, including broadband and mobile communication networks.\n\n(iii) Interconnection and interoperability of networks\n\nSupport will be provided for the interconnection, interoperability and security of networks underpinning the operation of specific public interest applications and services.\n\nThe following sections identify at each level of the trans-European networks the projects of common interest that must be specified in accordance with Article 9 and under the procedure laid down in Article 8.\n\nI. Applications\n\n- e-Government and e-Administration: more efficient, interactive, and integrated governmental services benefiting citizens and SME\'s constitute a major opportunity for the information society. On-line services including those in the field of electronic procurement, secured access to on-line public services for citizens and SME\'s, personal security, environment and tourism, business support for SME\'s (including information services and electronic commerce), and services aimed at broadening participation in the democratic decision-making process will be supported at all levels: European, national, regional and local. Services may be provided by, or with the support of, public authorities as a service in the public interest benefiting citizens and SME\'s.\n\n- Health: health telematics networks and services offer significant opportunities for the improvement of access and quality of care, as well as handling the impacts of medical advances and demographic changes. Innovative services will be supported linking health care institutions and other points of care, and providing health services directly to the public, in particular supporting actions on disease prevention and health promotion.\n\n- Disabled and elderly: developments in network communications offer significant opportunities for the participation of older people and people with disabilities in the information society. Network applications and services addressing their specific needs are able to contribute to the overcoming of socio-economic, geographical and cultural barriers. Services will be supported catering for the requirements of older people and people with disabilities with the purpose of promoting their full integration and participation in the information society.\n\n- Learning and culture: high levels of education, training and cultural awareness are crucial to economic development and social cohesion. Their importance will continue to be underlined in future with the increasing influence of technology in the information society. Services will be supported providing new innovative ways of presenting educational and cultural information, including services for lifelong learning.\n\nII. Generic services\n\n- Advanced mobile services: trials are under way on the interoperability aspects of innovative applications for 2,5 to 3G mobile networks. They will establish the basis for advanced end-to-end solutions in the mobile environment providing location-based, personalised, and context-sensitive services. Support will be provided for the launch of advanced mobile applications and services in the general interest including those for navigation and guidance, traffic and travel information, network security and billing, m-commerce, m-business and mobile work, learning and culture, emergency services and health.\n\n- Trust and confidence services: the active involvement of businesses and citizens in the information society is dependent on their trust and confidence in the available services. Security is therefore a priority issue presenting a major challenge for the future. Support will be provided for services in the public interest aimed at all aspects of security including cooperation for effective networking within the European Union on national CERT systems.\n\nIII. Interconnection and interoperability of networks\n\n- Interconnection and interoperability: the interconnection and interoperability of networks is a pre-requisite for effective trans-European services. Support will be provided for the interconnection, interoperability and security of networks necessary for the operation of specific public interest services. Projects concerning the development and enhancement of telecommunications networks will receive particular scrutiny to ensure that there is no interference with free market conditions.\n\nIV. Supplementary support and coordination actions\n\nIn addition to its support for projects of common interest, the Community shall initiate actions aimed at providing the appropriate environment for the realisation of the projects. The financing of these actions should not take away in any significant manner from the amounts allocated to the rest of the programme. The actions will contribute to programme awareness, consensus development and concerted efforts concerning European, national, regional and local activities for stimulation and promotion of new applications and services, in conformity with the implementation of programmes in other areas, as well as the development of broadband networks. They will involve consultation with European standardisation and strategic planning bodies and coordination with actions funded by the different Community financial instruments, including:\n\n- strategic studies toward target specifications, and transition towards these targets. These specifications will help sector actors to make sound economic investment decisions,\n\n- definition of means of accessing broadband networks,\n\n- establishment of common specifications based on European and world standards,\n\n- furthering cooperation among sector actors, including public and private partnerships (PPP),\n\n- coordination of the activities undertaken under this Decision with related Community and national programmes.""'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 11 (4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 (2), the Council imposed, inter alia, a definitive anti-dumping duty of 7,2 % on imports of synthetic staple fibres of polyesters, not carded, combed or otherwise processed for spinning, commonly referred to as synthetic fibres of polyester (hereinafter referred to as the 'product concerned` of 'PSF`), currently classifiable within CN code 5503 20 00 and originating in India, with the exception of imports from five Indian exporters specifically mentioned, which were subject either to a lesser rate of duty or to no duty at all.
B. PRESENT PROCEDURE
(2) In January 1996, the Commission received, from the Indian producer Viral Filaments Limited (hereinafter referred to as 'Viral` or the 'company`), an application for a review of the measures currently in force, i.e. a request to initiate a 'new exporter` review proceeding of Regulation (EEC) No 54/93, pursuant to Article 11 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`). Viral claimed that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in India subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Furthermore, it claimed that it did not export the product concerned during the period of investigation on which the current measures in force were based with regard to the determination of dumping, i.e. the period from 1 January to 31 August 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the 'original investigation period`). Finally, Viral also claimed that it had actually exported the product concerned to the Community and that it had also entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to export significant quantities of PSF to the Community.
(3) The Commission, after having verified the evidence submitted by the Indian exporter concerned, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation, after consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, initiated, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1285/96 (3), a review of Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 with regard to Viral and commenced its investigation.
In the Regulation initiating the review, the Commission also repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 with regard to imports of the product concerned, produced and exported to the Community by Viral, and directed customs authorities, pursuant to Article 14 (5) of the Basic Regulation, to take appropriate steps to register such imports.
(4) The product covered by the present review is the same product as the one under consideration in Regulation (EEC) No 54/93.
(5) The Commission officially advised Viral and the representatives of the exporting country. Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However, no such request has been received by the Commission.
The Commission sent a questionnaire to Viral and received a proper and timely reply.
The Commission sought and verify all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation.
(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996.
(7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the present investigation where circumstances had not changed.
C. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
(8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in this investigation, this review is limited to dumping.
D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. New exporter qualification
(9) The investigation confirmed that Viral had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period. Production of PSF by Viral and export thereof to the Community started, in fact, only during the second half of 1995.
Furthermore, according to documentary evidence submitted, Viral satisfactorily demonstrated that it did not have any links, either direct or indirect, with any of Indian exporters subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned.
Accordingly, it is confirmed that Viral should be considered as a new exporter in accordance with Article 11 (4) of the Basic Regulation, and thus its individual dumping margin should be determined.
2. Dumping
A. Normal value
(10) In accordance with Article 2 (2) of the Basic Regulation, an examination was conducted to ascertain whether the volume of Viral's sales of PSF on the Indian domestic market in total reached at least 5 % of the volume of the Indian exports of the product concerned to the Community. It was established, based on the documentary evidence submitted in the company's questionnaire reply, that domestic sales of the like product achieved a level considerably in excess of the aforementioned 5 % threshold.
For each of the types of PSF sold on the domestic market and found to be identical or directly comparable to types sold for export to the Community, the Commission then established whether domestic sales per type were made in sufficient quantities.
Domestic sales of each type were considered to have been made in sufficient quantities within the meaning of Article 2 (2) of the Basic Regulation as the volume of each type of PSF sold in India during the investigation period represented 5 % or more of the quantity of the comparable type of PSF sold for export to the Community.
The Commission subsequently examined whether the domestic sales of each type of PSF exported to the Community could be considered to have been made in the ordinary course of trade.
Whether or not domestic sales were made in the ordinary course of trade was determined pursuant to Article 2 (4) of the Basic Regulation. Since, per product type, the weighted average selling price was equal to, or higher than, the weighted average unit cost and as the volume of sales below unit cost represented less than 20 % of the sales being used to determine normal value, all domestic sales were regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade.
In accordance with Article 2 (1) of the Basic Regulation, normal value was therefore based on the weighted average prices of all domestic sales of the corresponding product types exported to the Community.
B. Export price
(11) Export prices were established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product concerned when sold for export to the Community, in accordance with Article 2 (8) of the Basic Regulation.
C. Comparison
(12) In accordance with Article 2 (11) of the Basic Regulation, the weighted average normal value by product type was compared, on an ex-factory basis, to the weighted average export price at the same level of trade.
For the purpose of a fair comparison, due allowance in the form of adjustments was made for differences which were claimed and demonstrated to affect price comparability. These adjustments were made, in accordance with Article 2 (10) of the Basic Regulation, in respect of commissions, transport, insurance, handling and ancillary costs, credit costs, discounts and rebates.
D. Dumping margin
(13) The above comparison revealed that no dumping existed for exports to the Community of the product concerned made by Viral during the investigation period.
E. AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED
(14) Based on the findings of no dumping made during the investigation, it is considered that no anti-dumping measure should be imposed on imports into the Community of PSF, produced and exported by Viral. Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.
F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURE
(15) Viral was informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to propose the amendment to Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 and was given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received.
(16) This review carried out does not affect the date on which Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 will expire pursuant to Article 11 (2) of the Basic Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 907/97 of 20 May 1997 amending Regulation (EEC) No 54/93 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of synthetic fibres of polyesters originating in India and the Republic of Korea', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe following shall be added at the end of Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 54/93:\n\n', as well as Viral Filaments Limited, India (Taric additional code 8642)`.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nCustoms authorities are hereby directed to discontinue registration pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1285/96.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 May 1997.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURES
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 (3), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more (the product concerned) falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 originating in India. The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0 % and 55,6 %.
(2) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 (4), imposed at the same time a definitive countervailing duty on imports of the same product originating in India. The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0 % and 35,4 % for individual exporters, with a rate of 48,8 % for non-cooperating exporters.
B.   CURRENT PROCEDURE
1.   Request for a new exporter review
(3) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review of Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, from one Indian producer, VSL Wires Limited (the applicant). The applicant claimed that it was not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India. Furthermore, it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (i.e. from l April 1997 to 31 March 1998), but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. On the basis of the above, it requested that an individual duty rate be established for it, in case dumping would be found.
2.   Initiation of a review
(4) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1225/2003 (5), a ‘new exporter’ review of Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 with regard to the applicant and commenced its investigation. At the same time, the anti-dumping duty in force was repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned produced and exported to the Community by the applicant, and those imports were made subject to registration pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(5) At the same time and on the same grounds, following a request from the applicant, the Commission initiated an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 (6) pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97.
3.   Product concerned
(6) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999, namely stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more, containing by weight 2,5 % or more of nickel, excluding wire containing by weight 28 % or more but no more than 31 % of nickel and 20 % or more but no more than 22 % of chromium.
4.   Investigation period
(7) The investigation covered the period from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 (the review investigation period).
5.   Parties concerned
(8) The Commission officially advised the applicant and the Government of India (GOI) of the initiation of the procedure. Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However, no such views or any request for a hearing was received by the Commission.
(9) The Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a full reply within the required deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant.
C.   SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
(10) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made by the applicant, the review was limited to dumping.
D.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(11) The applicant was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it was not related, directly or indirectly, to any of the Indian exporting producers subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned.
(12) The investigation confirmed that the applicant had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period, i.e. from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998.
(13) The Commission examined whether the applicant had exported the product concerned to the Community subsequent to the original investigation period. In this respect, it was established that the applicant has not realised any sales whatsoever to the Community and neither has it entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community of the product concerned during the review investigation period.
(14) It was established that the applicant had only realised one sale to the Community which actually took place in August 2001, i.e. after the original investigation period but well before the review investigation period.
(15) The applicant requested the Commission to extend the review investigation period to cover the period in which the sale mentioned in recital 14 was realised. In this respect, the applicant argued that it had requested the ‘new exporter’ review in August 2001 and proposed an investigation period from 1 July 2001 to 31 March 2003.
(16) In reply to the questionnaire, the applicant identified a contract that had been signed during the review investigation period, but on spot confirmed that the sale had never been materialized. It is therefore established that the applicant has not entered into an irrevocable obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community and that the applicant's statement of ‘intent to continue the export to EC’ following the 2001 sale has not been materialized. For the above reasons, it is considered that in the absence of any export transaction to the Community or any irrevocable contractual obligation during the review investigation period, no individual dumping margin can be established for the applicant in accordance with the provisions of Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. Thus, the dumping margin found in the original investigation for parties not individually investigated, i.e. 76,2 % (see recital 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999), should apply.
E.   THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY
(17) Given that the highest injury elimination level of 55,6 % established during the original investigation is lower than the 76,2 % dumping margin set for the applicant (see recital 16), the anti-dumping duty rate for the applicant should not be higher than this injury elimination level in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation.
(18) Despite the lack of exports to the Community during the review investigation period, an individual countervailing duty rate based on the export subsidy amount (ad valorem 14,1 %), was calculated for the applicant in the parallel accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (see recital 5).
(19) In accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation and Article 24(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation.
(20) On the basis of the above, the definitive anti-dumping duty rate imposed for imports into the Community of stainless steel wire with a diameter of 1 mm or more produced and exported by VSL Wires Limited, expressed as a percentage of the CIF Community frontier price (customs duty unpaid) and taking into account the results of the parallel accelerated review of the countervailing measures in force, should be 41,5 %, i.e. 55,6 % minus 14,1 %. Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.
F.   RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY
(21) The anti-dumping duty applicable to VSL Wires Limited shall also be levied retroactively on imports which have been subject to registration pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1225/2003.
G.   DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURES
(22) The Commission informed the applicant and the GOI of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose that Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 be amended. They were also given a reasonable period of time to comment.
(23) In its response to the disclosure, the applicant claimed that the Commission failed to consider other available alternatives for establishing export price and in particular the use of the applicant's export prices to other third countries for the purpose of dumping margin calculations. In this respect, it should be noted that in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation, the export price in a dumping calculation shall be the price actually paid or payable for the product when sold for export from the exporting country to the Community. There is no provision whatsoever that the export price can also be established on the basis of exports from the exporting country to destinations other than the Community. The claim should therefore be rejected and the conclusions set out in recitals 11 to 16 confirmed.
(24) This review does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '16.7.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 244/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1294/2004\nof 12 July 2004\namending Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of stainless steel wire with a diameter of 1\xa0mm or more originating in India', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe table in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1600/1999 is hereby amended by adding the following:\n‘VSL Wires Limited, G-1/3 MIDC, Tarapur Industrial Area, Boisar District, Thane, Maharashtra, India\n41,5\nA444 ’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The anti-dumping duty hereby imposed shall also be levied retroactively on imports of the product concerned which have been registered pursuant to Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1225/2003.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Unless otherwise specified, the provisions in force concerning customs duties shall apply.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 97/35/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas Articles 10 to 18 of Directive 90/220/EEC lay down a Community procedure enabling the competent authorities of a Member State to give consent to the placing on the market of products containing, or consisting of, genetically modified organisms;
Whereas a notification concerning the placing on the market of such a product has been submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom;
Whereas the competent authorities of the United Kingdom have subsequently forwarded the dossier thereon to the Commission with a favourable opinion;
Whereas the competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the said dossier;
Whereas subsequently the notifier formally requested that the scope of the notification be limited to 'handling of the product during import and before and during storage and processing`;
Whereas the notifier subsequently modified the proposed labelling in the original dossier as follows:
- those companies which are known to import for processing the product into the Community will be provided with product documentation informing them of the possibility that the product covered by the notification and produced outside the Community by or under licence from Hoechst Schering AgrEvo GmbH, may be present in bulk swede rape consignments,
- the product documentation to be provided will include, among others, information that the product has been produced by genetic modification as well as information on the potential uses of the product,
- the product documentation will also indicate that specific labelling requirements may be applicable in the Community for products derived from genetically modified swede rape;
Whereas, therefore, in accordance with Article 13(3) of Directive 90/220/EEC, the Commission is required to take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of that Directive;
Whereas the Commission sought the opinion of the relevant Scientific Committees established by Commission Decision 97/579/EC (3) on this dossier; whereas the opinion was delivered on 10 February 1998 by the Scientific Committee on Plants which concluded that there is no reason to believe that the import of the product with the aim of processing would have any effects on human health or the environment;
Whereas the Commission, having examined each of the objections raised in the light of Directive 90/220/EEC, the information submitted in the dossier and the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Plants, has reached the conclusion that there is no reason to believe that there will be any adverse effects on human health or the environment from the handling of the product in the environment during import and before and during storage and processing;
Whereas, Article 11(6) and Article 16(1) of Directive 90/220/EEC provide additional safeguards if new information on risks of the product becomes available;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the committee established under Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC,","{'title': '98/291/EC: Commission Decision of 22 April 1998 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified spring swede rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera), pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas maintaining the cultivation of grain legumes such as lentils, chick peas and vetches is of economic importance to the Community;
Whereas the objective of maintaining such crops may be achieved by granting aid per hectare; whereas the aid must be fixed at a rate enabling the abovementioned objective to be achieved; whereas the current rate of aid of ECU 181 per hectare is satisfactory;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops (5) lays down constraints on areas on which the compensatory aid is payable, in particular in respect of oilseeds; whereas the cultivation of such grain legumes provides a viable alternative and prevents imbalance on the Community market; whereas, however, too great an extension of areas under such crops should be avoided; whereas that can be achieved by fixing a maximum guaranteed area of 400 000 hectares;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 762/89 applies penalties to the aid paid in the marketing year following any overrun of the maximum guaranteed area; whereas this Regulation applies the penalty, in the event of an overrun, in the current marketing year; whereas transitional measures should be adopted by the Commission to avoid the application of two penalties in the first year of application, namely from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1577/96 of 30 July 1996 introducing a specific measure in respect of certain grain legumes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAid shall be granted for the production of the following grain legumes:\n\n(a) lentils covered by CN code 0713 40 90 (other);\n\n(b) chick peas covered by CN code 0713 20 90 (other);\n\n(c) vetches of the species Vicia sativa L. and Vicia ervilla Willd. covered by CN code ex 0713 90 90 (other).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 234 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Articles 3 (5), 5 (5), 8 (4) and 14 (5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1716/91 of 13 June 1991 concerning the alignment of the prices of sugar and sugar beet applicable in Spain on the common prices (2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1748/92 of 30 June 1992 fixing, for the 1992/93 marketing year, certain sugar prices and the standard quality of beet (4), fixed the intervention price for white sugar at ECU 53,01 per 100 kilograms applicable for the  non-deficit areas;
Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that derived intervention prices for white sugar are to be fixed for each of the deficit areas; whereas, for such fixing, it is appropriate that account be taken of the regional variations  which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, might be expected to occur in the price of sugar under natural conditions of price formation on the market;
Whereas a deficit supply situation is to be foreseen in the areas of production in Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom;
Whereas Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that an intervention price for raw sugar shall be fixed; whereas such price should be established on the basis of the intervention price for white sugar;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1748/92 fixed the basic price for beet at ECU 40 per tonne; whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the minimum price to be fixed for A beet shall be 98 % of the basic price of the beet and the  minimum price to be fixed for B beet shall in principle be 68 % of the said basic price, without prejudice to Article 28 (5) of that Regulation;
Whereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the threshold price for white sugar shall be equal to the target price, plus costs, calculated at a flat rate, of transport from the Community area having the largest surplus to the  most distant deficit consumption area in the Community, plus a flat-rate amount which takes into account the storage levy; whereas, given the state of supplies within the Community, account should be taken of transport charges between the departments of  northern France and Palermo;
Whereas the threshold price for raw sugar is to be derived from the threshold price for white sugar by reference to a processing margin and a standard yield;
Whereas the threshold price for molasses should be fixed in such a way that the receipts from sales of molasses may reach the level of receipts of undertakings taken into account in the fixing of basic prices for beet;
Whereas Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1716/92 provide that, for the first stage of the alignment of the prices for sugar and beet in Spain, an intervention price for white sugar and a basic price and minimum prices for beet are to be fixed  taking account in particular of a reducing factor with respect to a reference price; whereas, for the 1992/93 marketing year, the reducing factor with respect to the reference price is ECU 3,44 per 100 kilograms of white sugar and ECU 2,836 per tonne of  beet; whereas pursuant to Article 5 of that Regulation account should be taken of the corresponding common prices to be fixed for that marketing year for the purposes of fixing the prices for sugar and beet applicable in Spain;
Whereas Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 of 20 June 1977 laying down general rules for offsetting storage costs for sugar and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 750/68 (5) provides that the amount of repayment in the context of the  compensation for storage costs shall be fixed per month and per unit of weight, taking account of financing costs, insurance costs and specific storage costs; whereas, as a result of the maintenance of prices, interest of 10 % should continue to be  levied for financing costs, that is a monthly sum of ECU 0,52 per 100 kilograms of white sugar;
Whereas, at the end of the period of transition applicable to Portugal in the sugar sector, in other words from the 1992/93 marketing year, the price of white sugar applicable in Portugal must, in accordance with Article 238 (2) of the Act of Accession,  reach the common price after seven staged increases; whereas, as stated in the proceedings of the conference which preceded the accession of Portugal, the common reference price in question is the derived intervention price applicable in the  Ireland/United Kingdom area, in this case for the 1992/93 marketing year; whereas, moreover, the supply situation is still in a structural deficit in all Portuguese production areas; whereas, the results of the regionalization applicable to date in the  Ireland/United Kingdom production area are also valid in the Portuguese area; whereas, therefore, a derived intervention price should also be fixed for white sugar for all the areas in Portugal for the 1992/93 marketing year;
Whereas the case where beet prices in Portugal are higher than the common prices is regulated by Article 238 (3) (a) and (b) of the Act of Accession, which stipulates that where the price of a product in Portugal is higher than the common price, on the  one hand, the alignment results from the development of common prices during the seven years following accession, and on the other, the Council must carry out an analysis of the development of moves towards price alignment on the basis of an opinion  from the Commission;
Whereas that analysis has shown that the anticipated alignment as a result of the supposed increase in common prices for beet has not taken place because they have in general been maintained and even reduced; whereas, however, the Portuguese prices of  beet have been adapted in order to stop the gap between Portuguese and common prices from widening;
Whereas the gap between the Portuguese price of beet and the common reference price of beet, that is, the basic price plus, in accordance with the proceedings of the conference which preceded accession, the effect of regionalization for the  Ireland/United Kingdom area, is less than the 3 % fixed in Article 237 of the Act of Accession and therefore can be considered as minimal; whereas, therefore, the alignment of the price of sugar is achieved from the 1992/93 marketing year; whereas,  therefore, the minimum prices of beet applicable to Portugal can now justifiably be set in accordance with Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, which means that from the 1992/93 marketing year, they are established on the basis of the derived  intervention price for white sugar fixed for all the areas of Portugal,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1749/92 of 30 June 1992 fixing, for the 1992/93 marketing year, the derived intervention prices for white sugar, the intervention price for raw sugar, the minimum prices for A and B beet, the threshold prices, the amount of compensation for storage costs and the prices to be applied in Spain and Portugal', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the deficit areas of the Community, the derived intervention price for white sugar shall be fixed, per 100 kilograms, at:\n\n(a) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in the United Kingdom;\n\n(b) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in Ireland;\n\n(c) ECU 54,22 for all the areas in Portugal;\n\n(d) ECU 54,95 for all the areas in Italy.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe intervention price of raw sugar shall be ECU 43,94 per 100 kilograms.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

(2002/971/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c), Article 67(1) and Article 300(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the ""HNS Convention"") is aimed at ensuring adequate, prompt, and effective compensation of persons who suffer damage caused by spills of hazardous and noxious substances, when carried by sea. The HNS Convention fills a significant gap in the international regulation of marine pollution liability.
(2) Articles 38, 39 and 40 of the HNS Convention affect Community secondary legislation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters(3).
(3) The Community therefore has sole competence in relation to Articles 38, 39 and 40 of the HNS Convention inasmuch as that Convention affects the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. The Member States retain their competence for matters covered by that Convention which do not affect Community law.
(4) Pursuant to the HNS Convention, only sovereign States may be party to it; there are no plans, in the short term, to reopen negotiations for the purpose of taking into account Community competence for the matter. It is not therefore possible for the Community to ratify or accede to the HNS Convention at present, nor is there any prospect that it will be able to do so in the near future.
(5) The HNS Convention is particularly important, given the interests of the Community and its Member States, because it makes for improved victim protection under international rules on marine pollution liability, in keeping with the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
(6) The substantive rules of the system established by the HNS Convention fall under the national competence of Member States and only the provisions of jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of the judgments are matters covered by exclusive Community competence. Given the subject matters and the aim of the HNS Convention, acceptance of the provisions of that Convention which come under Community competence cannot be dissociated from the provisions which come under the competence of the Member States.
(7) The Council should therefore authorise the Member States to ratify or accede to the HNS Convention in the interest of the Community, under the conditions set out in this Decision.
(8) Member States should finalise, within a reasonable time, their procedures for ratification of, or accession to, the HNS Convention in the interest of the Community. Member States should exchange information on the state of their ratification or accession procedures in order to prepare the deposit of their instruments of ratification of, or accession to, the Convention.
(9) The United Kingdom and Ireland are taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas the support system for producers of certain arable crops introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 (2) provides that, in order to qualify for compensatory payments under the general scheme, producers must set aside a predetermined percentage of their arable land; whereas this percentage is to be reviewed to take account of production and market developments;
Whereas, since the introduction of this system, the cereals market has achieved a better balance as a result of a reduction in production and an increase in Community consumption; whereas this situation, together with the very low level of stocks and very firm prices on the world market, has resulted in a significant reduction in stocks and a sharp rise in the prices for cereals on the Community market;
Whereas the present market situation for cereals is threatening to undermine, in the short term, the Community's presence on the world market and to jeopardize some of the results achieved since the reform of the arable sector, in particular the continuing rise in the consumption of cereals in animal feed; whereas the rate for set-aside beginning not later than 15 January 1997 should therefore be set for the 1997/98 marketing year at a level lower than that resulting from the provisions in force and the application of special set-aside should be suspended where the base area under the 1996/97 marketing year is exceeded;
Whereas, in the event of a transfer of the set-aside requirement, the basic 17,5 % set-aside rate is increased by 3 %; whereas this increase should be adjusted in order to maintain a similar ratio between the basic rate and the percentage increase due on transfer, as a result of the drop in the basic rate; whereas, in the event of a transfer of the set-aside requirement to areas which are sensitive from an environmental point of view, it is appropriate not to apply the abovementioned increase,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1598/96 of 30 July 1996 derogating from Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops as regards the set-aside requirement for the 1997/98 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the 1997/98 marketing year, notwithstanding Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92:\n\n- the set-aside requirement referred to in paragraph 1 and the said Article shall be set at 5 %,\n\n- the increase referred to in the second indent of paragraph 7 of the said Article shall be set at one percentage point.

","Commission Regulation (EC) No 893/2004
of 29 April 2004
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.
(5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 635/2000, lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.
(7) By Regulations (EC) No 1039/2003(4), (EC) No 1086/2003(5), (EC) No 1087/2003(6), (EC) No 1088/2003(7), (EC) No 1089/2003(8) and (EC) No 1090/2003(9) the Council adopted autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to those countries.. Those Regulations provide that with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic, shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(8) Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(10), provides that with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in Article 1(2) thereof, which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(9) Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(11), provides that with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(10) With a view to enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004, and in order to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the acceding states on the Community level and to prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of products in receipt of export refunds, the setting of all remaining export refunds has been discontinued in the milk and milk products sector, in relation to the products concerned when exported unprocessed to the acceding states.
(11) Therefore, with effect from 7 April 2004 no refund should be set for certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Cyprus and Poland and for the goods which are not referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 when exported to Hungary.

Whereas:
(1) because of the risk for human and animal health posed by the circulation in the Community of poor copies of zootechnical additives, Directive 70/524/EEC, as amended by Council Directive 96/51/EC(3), provides for the linking of the authorisation of certain classes of additives to the person responsible for putting them into circulation;
(2) in particular Article 9h of Directive 70/524/EEC provides for the replacement of the provisional authorisations of additives included in Annex I after 31 December 1987 and belonging to the group of coccidiostats and other medicinal substances and transferred to Chapter II of Annex B by authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting them into circulation for a period of 10 years;

Although the authorisations are given for a specified period they may be withdrawn at any time in accordance with Article 9m and Article 11 of Directive 70/524/EEC.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (1), and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2010/221/EU of 15 April 2010 approving national measures for limiting the impact of certain diseases in aquaculture animals and wild aquatic animals in accordance with Article 43 of Council Directive 2006/88/EC (2) allows certain Member States to apply restrictions on consignments of those animals in order to prevent the introduction of certain diseases into their territory, provided that they have either demonstrated that their territory, or certain demarcated areas of their territory, are free of such diseases or that they have established an eradication or surveillance programme to obtain such freedom.
(2) The continental parts of the territories of Finland and Sweden are listed in Annex II to Decision 2010/221/EU as territories with an approved eradication programme as regards bacterial kidney disease (BKD).
(3) The coastal parts of the territory of Sweden are listed in Annex II to Decision 2010/221/EU as having an approved eradication programme as regards infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPN).
(4) Accordingly, Decision 2010/221/EU approves certain national measures by Finland and Sweden on consignments of aquaculture animals of susceptible species into those areas. However, to allow for a re-evaluation of the appropriateness of those national measures, the authorisation to apply those measures is limited in time until 31 December 2011.
(5) Finland has submitted reports to the Commission on the functioning of its national eradication programme for BKD, in which it is stated that the eradication of BKD has not yet been successful. While progress has been made in several areas, some areas still remain infected with BKD. Finland has therefore requested that the geographical demarcation of the programme be limited to two continuous zones covering 19 water catchment areas. In those two zones, only four farms are under BKD-related restrictions and they are all undergoing the process of destroying infected fish, and the cleaning and disinfection of the facilities.
(6) Sweden has submitted a report to the Commission on the functioning of its national eradication programmes for BKD and IPN. The number of reported cases has been reduced significantly and both diseases are close to being eradicated from the programme areas. The continental parts of Sweden are already free of IPN and the national eradication programme in the coastal waters therefore also functions as a buffer to protect the already declared free areas.
(7) On the basis of the information provided by Finland and Sweden, it is appropriate to continue those national measures. However, taking into account that eradication has not yet been achieved despite years of applying national eradication programmes, the appropriateness and necessity of the national measures needs to be re-evaluated in due time. Therefore, the authorisation to apply those national measures should be limited to two more years until 31 December 2013.
(8) Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU currently lists nine compartments in the territory of Ireland with an approved surveillance programme as regards ostreid herpesvirus 1 μνar (OsHV-1 μνar).
(9) Ireland has notified to the Commission the detection of OsHV-1 μνar in two of those compartments, namely in Gweendore Bay within compartment 1 and Ballinakill Bay within compartment 4. Consequently, the geographical demarcation of those two compartments in Annex III to Decision 2010/221/EU should be amended.
(10) Decision 2010/221/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.

(1) In order to mitigate or eliminate the threat of serious imbalance in the cheese market created by the import ban introduced by the Russian government, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014 (2) provided for a temporary exceptional private storage aid scheme for cheeses for a maximum volume of 155 000 tonnes. To ensure the respect of that maximum quantity, a notification and monitoring mechanism was set up.
(2) While the effects of the Russian import ban impact potentially the whole EU market for cheeses, the most affected Member States are Finland and the Baltic States for which Russia is the exclusive trading partner for cheese and Germany, the Netherlands and Poland, for which Russia is a significant destination for cheeses. Furthermore, while cheeses with a geographical indication are affected by the import ban, they only represent a minimum share of the whole range of cheese exported to Russia.
(3) The notifications received so far in application of the monitoring mechanism of Article 12 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014 show that the scheme is disproportionately used by producers of cheese from areas traditionally not exporting significant quantities to Russia. The scheme therefore does not seem adequate to react effectively and efficiently against the market disturbances that result from the Russian ban.
(4) In light of the above and to ensure a sound use of the Union budget, it is appropriate to put an end to the private storage scheme for cheeses as provided for by Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014.
(5) In order to reduce the risk of an inefficient use of the Union budget, this measure needs to apply immediately.
(6) In order to ensure that the expectations of operators having applied for the aid for private storage of cheeses under Article 4 of Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014 are protected, applications lodged before the entry into force of this Regulation should be taken into account for the payment of the aid provided for by Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014,","{'header': '23.9.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 279/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 992/2014\nof 22 September 2014\nrepealing Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In order to mitigate or eliminate the threat of serious imbalance in the cheese market created by the import ban introduced by the Russian government, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 950/2014(2)provided for a temporary exceptional private storage aid scheme for cheeses for a maximum volume of 155\xa0000 tonnes.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE 2012/25/EU
of 9 October 2012
laying down information procedures for the exchange, between Member States, of human organs intended for transplantation
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2010/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 7 July 2010, on standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation (1), and in particular to Article 29 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure a high level of public health the exchange of human organs between Member States requires a detailed set of uniform procedural rules for the transmission of information on organs and donor characterisation, for the traceability of organs and for the reporting of serious adverse events and reactions.
(2) A variety of stakeholders in the Member States may be involved, as senders or as addressees, in the transmission of information for the exchange of human organs, such as competent authorities, delegated bodies including European organ exchange organisations, procurement organisations and transplantation centres. Where such bodies send or receive information for the exchange of human organs, they should act in accordance with the common procedures laid down in this Directive. These procedures should not preclude additional verbal contacts, in particular in case of urgencies.
(3) In the implementation of this Directive, Member States are to ensure that the processing of donors’ and recipients’ personal data complies with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (2). In order to enhance awareness of the persons processing information transmitted pursuant to this Directive, it is appropriate to include a reminder in the written communications pursuant to this Directive.
(4) In order to allow for rapid responses in case of alerts, and in order to facilitate the implementation of the obligation, provided for in Article 10(3)(b) of Directive 2010/53/EU, to keep data needed to ensure full traceability for a minimum of 30 years after donation, and without prejudice to the obligations of other bodies in that respect, it is appropriate that competent authorities or delegated bodies handle and record that information. Procurement organisations and transplantation centres should therefore ensure that their respective competent authorities or delegated bodies receive a copy of the information on organ and donor characterisation exchanged pursuant to this Directive, where applicable.
(5) Given the current variety of practices between Member States, it is not appropriate at this stage to provide for a standard form for the transmission of information on organ and donor characterisation in this Directive. However, in order to facilitate mutual understanding of the information transmitted, such a standard form should be developed in the future, in cooperation with the Member States.
(6) A serious adverse event or reaction may be detected in a Member State of origin or destination and may be of concern for the quality and safety of the donated organs and as a consequence for the health of recipients, and in case of living donation also for the health of the donor. When organs are exchanged between Member States, such concerns may occur in different Member States. Moreover, organs from one donor might be transplanted into recipients in different Member States so that, if a serious adverse event or reaction is first detected in one Member State of destination, the competent authorities or delegated bodies in the Member State of origin and in the other Member States of destination have to be informed. It is essential to ensure that all competent authorities or delegated bodies of all the Member States concerned are informed without undue delay. In order to reach this objective, Member States should ensure that all relevant information is disseminated among all Member States concerned through a set of written reports. Initial reports should be updated if additional relevant information becomes available.
(7) The transmission of information is very often a matter of urgency. It is essential that the senders of information are able to identify and inform rapidly the relevant addressees. The competent authorities or delegated bodies of a Member State should, where appropriate in accordance with the repartition of competence in the Member State concerned, transfer the information received pursuant to this Directive to the appropriate recipient. A list of national contact points, including their contact details, should be made available at Union level and be constantly kept up to date.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on organ transplantation, established under Article 30 of Directive 2010/53/EU,","{'header': '10.10.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 275/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE 2012/25/EU\nof 9 October 2012\nlaying down information procedures for the exchange, between Member States, of human organs intended for transplantation\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In order to ensure a high level of public health the exchange of human organs between Member States requires a detailed set of uniform procedural rules for the transmission of information on organs and donor characterisation, for the traceability of organs and for the reporting of serious adverse events and reactions.\n\n((2)) A variety of stakeholders in the Member States may be involved, as senders or as addressees, in the transmission of information for the exchange of human organs, such as competent authorities, delegated bodies including European organ exchange organisations, procurement organisations and transplantation centres.

(1) Decision No 276/1999/EC(5) was adopted for a period of four years.
(2) In accordance with Article 6(4) of Decision No 276/1999/EC, the Commission has submitted to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions an evaluation report on the results obtained at the end of two years in implementing the action lines set out in Annex I to that Decision.
(3) The findings of the evaluation formed part of the basic documentation for a workshop on safer use of new online technologies at which leading experts in the field examined the likely future evolution of the issues addressed by the action plan laid down in Decision No 276/1999/EC (hereafter referred to as the action plan) and made recommendations to the Commission.
(4) New online technologies, new users and new usage patterns create new dangers and exacerbate existing dangers at the same time as opening a wealth of new opportunities.
(5) There is a clear need for coordination within the safer Internet field, both on the national and the European level. There should be a large degree of decentralisation using networks of national focal points. The involvement of all the relevant actors, especially a greater number of content providers in the different sectors, should be encouraged. The Commission should act as a facilitator for and contributor to European and global cooperation. Cooperation between the Community and candidate and accession countries should be enhanced.
(6) More time is needed for actions to be implemented to enhance networking, to achieve the objectives of the action plan and to take account of new online technologies.
(7) The financial framework constituting the prime reference for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure should be amended accordingly.
(8) The Commission should be required to present a second report on the results obtained in implementing the action lines after four years and a final report at the end of the action plan.
(9) The list of candidate and accession countries able to participate should be amended by including Malta and Turkey.
(10) The Action Plan should be extended for a further period of two years which should be regarded as a second phase; in order to make specific provision for the second phase, the action lines should be amended, taking account of the experience and the findings of the evaluation report.

(1) On 28 May 2009, the Commission adopted Decision 2009/420/EC amending Decision 2006/133/EC requiring Member States temporarily to take additional measures against the dissemination of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode) as regards areas in Portugal, other than those in which it is known not to occur (2). That Decision introduced in Commission Decision 2006/133/EC (3), as from 16 June 2009, the obligation that susceptible wood packaging material not originating from the demarcated areas undergoes one of the approved treatments specified in Annex I to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 and is marked according to Annex II to the said Standard before being moved from the demarcated areas to other areas in Member States or in third countries as well as from part of the demarcated area in which the pine wood nematode is known to occur to the part of the demarcated area designated as a buffer zone.
(2) Wood packaging material is required for the transport of many goods of all kinds. However, until now the production and use of susceptible wood packaging material treated and marked in accordance with the Annexes I and II to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 is not generalised in the Community. It appears in particular that not enough wood packaging material complying with the FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 can be made available at short time to cover the needs of the economic operators trading goods from Portugal to other Member States or third countries.
(3) To avoid risks of disproportionate disruption of trade, it appears necessary to provide for a derogation as regards the date of application of the requirements set out in Decision 2006/133/EC, as amended by Decision 2009/420/EC, which refer to the obligation to treat and mark in accordance with Annexes I and II to FAO International Standard for Phytosanitary measures No 15 susceptible wood packaging material not originating from demarcated areas before moving it from the demarcated areas in Portugal to other areas.

(3) It is necessary to consider that certain medicinal preparations known as homeopathic medicinal products, for human beings or animals, are prepared from products, substances or compositions called homeopathic stocks in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described in various officially recognised pharmacopoeias, with respect to human beings, in accordance with Article 1 of Council Directive 92/73/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directives 65/65/EEC and 75/319/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic medicinal products(3), and with respect to animals, in accordance with Article 1 of Council Directive 92/74/EEC of 22 September 1992 widening the scope of Directive 81/851/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to veterinary medicinal products and laying down additional provisions on homeopathic veterinary medicinal products(4).
(4) Preparations used for particular nutritional uses and preparations for special dietary uses are products specifically made up or prepared to fulfil the dietetic needs corresponding to a special physical or physiological condition in accordance with Article 1(2) of Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses(5), whereas food supplements are preparations generally based on vitamins, essential amino acids or fatty acids and minerals.
(5) A distinction between, on the one hand, preparations used for particular nutritional uses or dietetic uses which could contribute to maintaining health or well-being and, on the other hand, herbal medicinal preparations or preparations based on various active substances including certain homeopathic preparations which could help to prevent or treat diseases or specific ailments can be established. With regard to products put up for retail sale, the criteria for the distinction can be established on the basis of verifiable technical specifications generally given on the label, on packaging or on the accompanying user directions, for example, the presence of active substances, dosage and mode of application.
(6) It seems appropriate to create a list of mandatory criteria laid down in an additional note to Chapter 30 of the Combined Nomenclature, which covers pharmaceutical products.

Whereas, to protect animal and human health in the Community, the Commission adopted Decision 94/474/EC of 27 July 1994 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and repealing Decisions 89/469/EEC and 90/200/EEC (4), as last amended by Decision 95/287/EC (5), Decision 92/290/EEC of 14 May 1992 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine embryos in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom (6), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, Decision 94/381/EC of 27 June 1994 concerning certain protection measures with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian derived protein (7), as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (8), and Decision 94/382/EC of 27 June 1994 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste of ruminant origin, with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (9), as amended by Decision 95/29/EC (10);
Whereas the Council, at its meeting on 1 to 3 April 1996, concluded that a Commission decision in accordance with the Standing Veterinary Committee procedure should be adopted to require that all animal waste of mammalian origin in the Community shall be processed by a method that has been demonstrated as being de facto effective for the inactivation of the agents of scrapie and BSE;
Whereas the United Kingdom has taken additional measures as a result of the publication of new information on certain cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in that Member State;
Whereas the United Kingdom has banned the use of mammalian meat- and bonemeal for feeding of farm animals;
Whereas the United Kingdom has enlarged the list of bovine tissues which must be destroyed (Specified Bovine Material Order);
Whereas the Commission has adopted Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (11); whereas that Decision has prohibited the dispatch to the other Member States and to third countries, in particular, of bovine semen, and certain other products from the UK obtained from bovine animals slaughtered in the United Kingdom which are liable to enter the animal feed or human food chains and materials destined for use in medicinal products, cosmetics or pharmaceutical products;
Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee was consulted on 18 April 1996 and on 26 April 1996; whereas in the opinion of this Committee, bovine semen is considered to be safe for animal health with respect to BSE;
Whereas the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology was consulted on the safety of certain bovine products on 11 April 1996; whereas the Liaison Committee of European Associations of the Perfume, Cosmetics Products and Toiletries Industries (Colipa) recommended several years ago to its members not to use source materials from United Kingdom bovine animals; whereas this Committee has declared that its members follow this recommendation;
Whereas the Scientific Committee for Food was consulted on the safety of certain bovine products on 15 April 1996;
Whereas the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products was consulted on 16 April 1996; whereas the pharmaceutical sector had already introduced measures relating to the sourcing of materials and their treatment; whereas every medicinal product undergoes a pre-marketing approval before it is placed on the market, by virtue of which the treatment process of any raw material is evaluated; whereas at the request of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, all Community marketing authorization holders, or applicants with a positive opinion from the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products or the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products, have confirmed that the products concerned do not contain bovine tissue of United Kingdom origin;
Whereas subsequently, additional information has been made available in order to facilitate a more complete risk assessment; whereas, on this basis, the Scientific Veterinary Committee on 26 April 1996 concluded that a combination of appropriate sourcing of bovine materials used and the application of minimum processing standards which have been shown to effectively inactivate the BSE agent, together give good reassurances about the safety of these products for food or cosmetic use; whereas, consequently, the Scientific Veterinary Committee has recommended safety parameters for the production of these products which are therefore considered to be safe; whereas, furthermore, specific rules for the veterinary control of establishments should be put in place;
Whereas, therefore, the Commission considers that the products covered by the Annex to this Decision (such as gelatin and tallow) are safe;
Whereas these products and bovine semen may therefore be exempted from the prohibition provided for by Decision 96/239/EC;
Whereas in 1988 the United Kingdom introduced a requirement for animals affected with BSE to be completely destroyed; whereas the Council, at its meeting on 1 to 3 April 1996, concluded that bovine animals over the age of 30 months shall not enter the human food or animal food chains or be used for cosmetic or pharmaceutical products; whereas such animals must not be used as source materials for certain bovine products as referred to above;
Whereas furthermore, certain bovine tissues must not be used as source materials for these products;
Whereas it is necessary to lay down appropriate guarantees for the dispatch from the United Kingdom of products obtained from bovine animals which were not slaughtered in the United Kingdom;
Whereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in the United Kingdom to verify the application of the measures provided for in this Decision;
Whereas the United Kingdom has presented a proposal for measures to control and eradicate BSE in the United Kingdom, in particular selective compulsory slaughter of animals and/or herds identified as being most likely to have been exposed to infected meat- and bonemeal and an improved system of individual identification of bovine animals to ensure effective control of movements and traceability of animals (animal passport system);
Whereas the Standing Veterinary Committee has not given an opinion; whereas the Commission has therefore proposed these measures to the Council on 23 May 1996 in accordance with Article 17 of Directive 89/662/EEC, the Council being required to adopt measures within 15 days;
Whereas, however, the Council has not acted within the required time limit; whereas the Council has not decided against the proposed measures by simple majority within the same time limit; whereas these measures should now be adopted by the Commission,","{'title': '96/362/EC: Commission Decision of 11 June 1996 amending Decision 96/239/EC on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDecision 96/239/EC is amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety,
Whereas:
(1) The substance Verbena oil (Lippia citriodora Kunth.) is currently banned for use in cosmetic products, being listed in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC, under reference number 450. The ban of this substance was introduced on the basis of an opinion of May 2000 of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP), subsequently replaced by the ‘Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP)’ by Commission Decision 2004/210/EC (2), and later by the ‘Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS)’ by Commission Decision 2008/721/EC (3). The SCCNFP recommended the prohibition of Verbena (Lippia citriodora Kunth.) essential oils and derivatives, e.g. concrete and absolute, when used as a fragrance ingredient, based on the sensitising potential.
(2) However, the SCCNFP later concluded in an opinion issued in 2001 that Verbena absolute obtained from Lippia citriodora Kunth. should not be used such that the level in the finished cosmetic products exceeds 0,2 %. It is therefore appropriate to include Verbena absolute (Lippia citriodora Kunth.) together with its respective restriction in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC. It is also appropriate to amend reference number 450 of Annex II in order to specify that the substances Verbena essential oils (Lippia citriodora Kunth.) and derivatives other than absolute are prohibited when used as a fragrance ingredient.
(3) Directive 2008/42/EC of 3 April 2008 amending Council Directive 76/768/EEC, concerning cosmetic products, for the purpose of adapting Annexes II and III thereto to technical progress (4) included several allyl esters containing allyl alcohol as impurity in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC. The substance allyl phenethyl ether may contain allyl alcohol as impurity as well. For this substance, the SCCNFP issued an opinion in 2000 recommending an upper limit of 0,1 % of allyl alcohol as impurity.
(4) In the light of the SCCNFP opinion, as well as for consistency reasons, it is appropriate to include in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC the substance allyl phenethyl ether together with its respective restriction.
(5) The group of substances Terpene terpenoids sinpine is currently regulated under reference number 130 in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC. However, the word ‘sinpine’ is a trade name and should therefore be deleted from the designation of that group of substances.
(6) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) In view of a smooth transition from existing formulae of cosmetic products to formulae which comply with the requirements laid down in this Directive, it is necessary to provide for appropriate transitional periods.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Cosmetic Products,","{'header': '23.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/41', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2009/164/EU\nof 22 December 2009\namending, for the purpose of adaptation to technical progress, Annexes II and III to Council Directive 76/768/EEC concerning cosmetic products\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The substance Verbena oil (Lippia citriodoraKunth.) is currently banned for use in cosmetic products, being listed in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC, under reference number 450.

(3) Member States are required to communicate the results of their monitoring and report on the measures taken and the progress with regard to the application of codes of good agricultural practice to reduce nitrate levels. Using this information the Commission shall proceed every three years, and before 1 January 2002 for the first time, to a review of the maximum levels for nitrates in lettuce and spinach, with the overall objective of reducing the said levels.
(4) Annual monitoring data from Member States show reductions in levels of nitrates in lettuce.

The levels of nitrate in spinach show no clear trend for reduction.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For bixafen the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2009/700/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 8 October 2008 an application from Bayer CropScience for the inclusion of the active substance bixafen in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2009/700/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 19 July 2011.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bixafen (4) on 15 October 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft assessment report was finalised on 15 March 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for bixafen.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing bixafen may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve bixafen.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing bixafen. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 of 25 April 2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) in conformity with its obligations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 imposed a 15 % ad valorem additional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America as from 1 May 2005. In conformity with the WTO authorisation to suspend the application of concessions in respect of certain products originating in the United States, the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the CDSOA to the European Union at that time.
(2) The CDSOA disbursements for the most recent year for which data are available relate to the distribution of anti-dumping and countervailing duties collected during the Fiscal Year 2009 (1 October 2008-30 September 2009). On the basis of the data published by the United States’ Customs and Border Protection, the level of nullification or impairment caused to the European Union is calculated at USD 95,83 million.
(3) Since the level of nullification or impairment and consequently of suspension has increased, the first 19 products of the list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 should be added to the list set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 673/2005.
(4) The effect of a 15 % ad valorem additional import duty on imports from the United States of the products in the amended Annex I represents, over 1 year, a value of trade that does not exceed USD 95,83 million.
(5) Article 6(1) and 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 contain specific exemptions from the additional import duty. Since the applicability of those exemptions is dependent on certain conditions being met before the entry into force or on the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005, the exemptions cannot in practice apply for imports of the 19 products added by this Regulation to the list in Annex I. Specific provisions should therefore be adopted to make these exemptions effective for imports of those products.
(6) To avoid circumvention of the additional duty, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on trade retaliation,","{'header': '15.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 94/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 305/2010\nof 14 April 2010\nreplacing Annexes I and II to Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) As a result of the United States’ failure to bring the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (CDSOA) in conformity with its obligations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 imposed a 15\xa0%ad valoremadditional customs duty on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America as from 1 May 2005.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes S-methoprene.
(2) S-methoprene has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 18 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Ireland was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 29 October 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 December 2013, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from that report that biocidal products used for product-type 18 and containing S-methoprene may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve S-methoprene for use in biocidal products for product-type 18.
(7) Since the evaluation did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.

of 19 June 2001
on the granting of exceptional national aid by the Government of the French Republic for the distillation of certain wine sector products
(2001/477/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 88(2), third subparagraph, thereof,
Having regard to the request made by the Government of the French Republic on 20 April 2001,
Whereas:
(1) Article 29 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1) allows Community support for the distillation of wines in order to support the wine market and, as a consequence, facilitate the continuation of supplies of wine distillate.
(2) Article 30 of the above Regulation allows a crisis distillation measure if there is an exceptional case of wine market disturbance caused by serious surpluses and/or problems of quality.
(3) The 2000/2001 wine-growing year has shown that the introduction of distillation under Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as from 1 September 2000 handicapped some French vineyards, in which harvesting had not begun by that date; it can also be seen from an examination of contract applications by the closing date of 30 November 2000 that access was not available to all vineyards.
(4) Following a detailed examination of the effects on the market of the operation of distillation and its practice by jobbing distillers and of the crisis distillation introduced on a case-by-case basis at the request of Member States with the adoption of prices that differ according to the requests, on the basis of the details provided by the French Government, it has emerged that in France - despite crisis distillation of 800000 hectolitres at a price of EUR 1914 per % vol per hectolitre and national aid authorised by the Council under Decision 2000/810/EC(2), bringing the price of wine up to EUR 3,7 per % vol per hectolitre within the limit of 1 million hectolitres - there is still market stagnation with exceptionally large stocks, rising from 10,8 million hectolitres in August 1999 to 14,1 million hectolitres in August 2000.
(5) To deal with the situation, the French Government is planning, within the 1,5 million hectolitre quota unanimously approved on 7 June 2001 by the Management Committee for Wine set up by Article 74 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on a proposal from the Commission, to grant exceptional national aid to producers who supply wine for the distillation referred to in Article 30 of that Regulation, so as to bring the price of the wine supplied up from EUR 1,914 per % vol per hectolitre to EUR 3,05 per % vol per hectolitre, subject to a maximum cost of this national measure of EUR 19 million.
(6) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance which has arisen, to be compatible with the common market on the terms specified in this Decision,","{'title': '2001/477/EC: Council Decision of 19 June 2001 on the granting of exceptional national aid by the Government of the French Republic for the distillation of certain wine sector products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nExceptional aid by the French Government for the distillation of 1500000 hectolitres of wine on French territory, totalling not more than EUR 19 million, for the amount necessary to bring the price of wine up to EUR 3,05 per % vol per hectolitre in the context of the implementation of crisis distillation under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, shall be considered compatible with the common market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 19 June 2001.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nM.

Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

of 21 December 2000
laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of private storage aid for certain fishery products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, which repealed Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92(2) with effect from 1 January 2001, provides for private storage aid to be granted to producer organisations in respect of the products listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 104/2000. These rules differ from the previous scheme provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1690/94 of 12 July 1994 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 as regards the granting of private storage aid for certain fishery products(3) because of the introduction of a Community selling price. Regulation (EC) No 1690/94 should therefore be replaced in order to take account of these changes.
(2) The producer organisations should contribute to the costs related to the implementation of the private storage aid mechanism and therefore, the amount of aid should be fixed on the basis of the real technical cost and financial costs of storage operations. The technical costs should be defined on the basis of the immediate costs incurred under the mechanism. In order to avoid burdensome information requirements from the industry and complicated annual calculations, the financial costs should be a flat-rate sum adjusted on the basis of the interest rate determined in accordance with Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1259/96(5).
(3) In order to ensure product quality and to facilitate the disposal of products on the market, the requirements to be satisfied by operations qualifying for private storage aid should be laid down, together with requirements relating to storage and return to the market of the products concerned.
(4) In order to guarantee normal conditions of competition between producer organisations making use of the margin of tolerance provided for in Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, it is necessary to lay down rules which relate to its application and are consistent with other intervention mechanisms. The relevant provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000 of 15 November 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting financial compensation for withdrawal of certain fishery products(6) should therefore apply.
(5) The beneficiaries of aid should be obliged to keep stock records to increase the efficiency of checks and must communicate this information to the Member State. It is sufficient for the purposes of good management of the mechanism to require stock records during the minimum storage periods.
(6) The procedure for submitting applications for the payment of private storage aid should be laid down as well as the procedure for the granting of advance payments and the amount of the relevant security.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2813/2000 of 21 December 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards the grant of private storage aid for certain fishery products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 5 July 2013
on temporary measures relating to the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus
(ECB/2013/22)
(2013/388/EU)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first indent of Article 127(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular the first indent of Article 3.1, Article 12.1, Article 18 and the second indent of Article 34.1,
Having regard to Guideline ECB/2011/14 of 20 September 2011 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem (1), and in particular Section 1.6 and Sections 6.3.1, 6.3.2 and 6.4.2 of Annex I thereof,
Having regard to Guideline ECB/2013/4 of 20 March 2013 on additional temporary measures relating to Eurosystem refinancing operations and eligibility of collateral and amending Guideline ECB/2007/9 (2), and in particular Article 1(3) and Articles 5 and 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 18.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter the ‘NCBs’) may conduct credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants, with lending being based on adequate collateral. The standard criteria determining the eligibility of collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem monetary policy operations are laid down in Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.
(2) Pursuant to Section 1.6 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Governing Council may, at any time, change the instruments, conditions, criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Pursuant to Section 6.3.1 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils its requirements for high standards on the basis of any information it may consider relevant.
(3) Decision ECB/2013/13 of 2 May 2013 on temporary measures relating to the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus (3) temporarily suspended, as an exceptional measure, the Eurosystem’s minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds applicable to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus. Following the launch by the Republic of Cyprus of a debt management exercise involving its marketable debt instruments, the Governing Council decided that the adequacy as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus was negatively affected, and decided to repeal Decision ECB/2013/13 on 28 June 2013 (4).
(4) Following completion of the debt management exercise and confirmation that the Republic of Cyprus is complying with the conditionality of the economic and financial adjustment programme applicable to it, the Governing Council has further assessed that marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus currently have a quality standard sufficient to warrant their eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations.
(5) The Governing Council has therefore decided that the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus for Eurosystem monetary policy operations should again be restored, subject to applying specific haircuts to such instruments different from those provided for in Section 6.4.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.
(6) Under Article 7 of Guideline ECB/2013/4, the Eurosystem’s credit quality threshold does not apply to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the central governments of euro area Member States under a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme, unless the Governing Council decides that the respective Member State does not comply with the conditionality of the financial support and/or the macroeconomic programme. However, under Article 1(3) of the same Guideline, for the purposes of its Article 5(1) and Article 7, only Ireland, the Hellenic Republic and Portugal are considered euro area Member States compliant with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme. Therefore an additional Governing Council decision is required to waive the Eurosystem’s credit quality threshold for marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus.
(7) This exceptional measure will apply temporarily until the Governing Council considers that the normal application of the Eurosystem’s eligibility criteria and risk control framework for monetary policy operations can be reintroduced,","{'header': '18.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 195/27', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 5 July 2013\non temporary measures relating to the eligibility of marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus\n(ECB/2013/22)\n(2013/388/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 18.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter the ‘NCBs’) may conduct credit operations with credit institutions and other market participants, with lending being based on adequate collateral.

of 15 February 2008
terminating the partial interim review of anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of okoumé plywood originating in the People's Republic of China
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Measures in force
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1942/2004 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of okoumé plywood originating in the People's Republic of China. The duties in force range from 6,5 % to 23,5 % for four companies with individual duties and the residual duty is 66,7 %.
2.   Request for review
(2) On 3 April 2006 the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation to examine the scope of existing measures with a view to including new product types in the product definition.
(3) The request was lodged by the European Federation of the Plywood Industry (FEIC) (the applicant) on behalf of Community producers of okoumé plywood.
(4) The applicant alleged that new product types have appeared on the market such as plywood consisting solely of sheets of wood, each ply not exceeding 6 mm thickness, with at least one outer ply of bintangor, red canarium, kedondong or certain other species, not coated by a permanent film of other material. These products should be included in the scope of the measures on the grounds that they share the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and end uses as the product covered by the existing measures. Both the product concerned and the new product types should therefore be considered as a single product.
3.   Initiation
(5) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed to justify the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3) the initiation of a partial interim review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, limited in scope to the definition of the product concerned.
B.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By a letter dated 5 December 2007 to the Commission, the applicant withdrew its request for the partial interim review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of okoumé plywood originating the in the People's Republic of China.
(7) According to Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, a proceeding may be terminated where the request for a review is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(8) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However, no comments were received from any party. Consequently, there is no indication that the termination of the proceeding would not be in the Community interest.
(9) The Commission therefore concludes that the review concerning imports of okoumé plywood originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without amending the anti-dumping measures in force,","{'header': '16.2.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 42/9', 'title': ""COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 138/2008\nof 15 February 2008\nterminating the partial interim review of anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of okoumé plywood originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:'}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
(3) The application of the above criteria gives the world market price for unginned cotton determined hereinafter,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1293/2003 of 18 July 2003 determining the world market price for unginned cotton', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe world price for unginned cotton as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 is hereby determined as equalling EUR 28,195/100 kg.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 19 July 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 July 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas lemons are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas lemons harvested during a given crop year are marketed from June to May of the next year; whereas reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period 1 June to 31 May of the following year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- a maximum of 15 % spread over two marketing years,
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State with regard to Article 23 plus transport costs in part for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;

(1) On 20 December 2007 the Council adopted Decision 2007/868/EC implementing Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism (2), and establishing an updated list of persons and entities to which that Regulation applies.
(2) The Council has provided all the persons, groups and entities for which it was practically possible with statements of reasons explaining why they were listed in Decision 2007/868/EC. Concerning one group and three persons the amended statements of reasons has been provided to them, if possible, in April 2008.
(3) By way of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 22 December 2007 (3) the Council informed the persons, groups and entities listed in Decision 2007/868/EC that it had decided to keep them on the list. The Council also informed the persons, groups and entities concerned that it was possible to request a statement of the Council’s reasons for putting them on the list (where one had not already been communicated to them).
(4) The Council has carried out a complete review of the list of persons, groups and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies, as required by Article 2(3) of that Regulation. When doing so it took account of observations submitted to the Council by those concerned.
(5) In the case of one group, the Council has taken account of the fact that the decision by a competent authority on the basis of which the group was included on the list has not been in force since 24 June 2008. However, new information concerning the group has been brought to the Council’s attention. The Council considers that this new information warrants the group’s inclusion on the list.
(6) The Council has determined that one person should be removed from the list of persons, groups and entities to which Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 applies.
(7) The Council has concluded that with the exception of the person mentioned in recital (6), the persons, groups and entities listed in the Annex to Common Position 2007/871/CFSP (4) have been involved in terrorist acts within the meaning of Article 1(2) and (3) of Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism (5), that a decision has been taken with respect to them by a competent authority within the meaning of Article 1(4) of that Common Position, and that they should continue to be subject to the specific restrictive measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) Article 54 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1) provides that, in order to qualify for a payment under the single payment scheme, any set-aside entitlement must be accompanied by a hectare of land set aside from production.
(2) At the beginning of the 2007/2008 marketing year the cereals market is experiencing exceptionally high prices, both at Community and world level. The low level of Community 2006/2007 closing stocks was a consequence of a smaller than expected 2006 harvest. There is considerable uncertainty as regards the rebuilding of those stocks, given the preliminary forecasts for the 2007 harvest. On the international market, closing stocks in 2007/2008 are expected to fall to a historically low level, especially in the major exporting countries. Against this backdrop, even if the 2008 harvest were normal, stocks would not increase significantly, while a poor harvest would expose the internal market to potentially serious risks. Furthermore, cereals prices and stocks have a significant impact on the availability and prices of other arable crops, such as oilseeds and protein crops, and on the livestock sector, which contributes to the risk of the crisis extending to these other sectors.
(3) It is therefore appropriate, for 2008, to allow the use of set-aside land for agricultural purposes.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment (1), and in particular Title II thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3);
Whereas pursuant to Council Directive No 73/148/EEC (4) of 21 May 1973 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for nationals of Member States with regard to establishment and the provision of services, each Member State grants the right of permanent residence to nationals of other Member States who establish themselves within its territory in order to pursue activities as self-employed persons, when the restrictions on these activities have been abolished pursuant to the Treaty;
Whereas it is normal for a person to prolong a period of permanent residence in the territory of a Member State by remaining there after having pursued an activity there ; whereas the absence of a right so to remain in such circumstances is an obstacle to the attainment of freedom of establishment ; whereas, as regards employed persons, the conditions under which such a right may be exercised have already been laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1251/70 (5);
Whereas Article 48 (3) (d) of the Treaty recognizes the right of workers to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State ; whereas Article 54 (2) does not expressly provide a similar right for self-employed persons ; whereas, nevertheless, the nature of establishment, together with attachments formed to the countries in which they have pursued their activities, means that such persons have a definite interest in enjoying the same right to remain as that granted to workers ; whereas in justification of this measure reference should be made to the Treaty provision enabling it to be taken;
Whereas freedom of establishment within the Community requires that nationals of Member States may pursue self-employed activities in several Member States in succession without thereby being placed at a disadvantage;
Whereas a national of a Member State residing in the territory of another Member State should be guaranteed the right to remain in that territory when he ceases to pursue an activity as a self-employed person in that State because he has reached retirement age or by reason of permanent incapacity to work ; whereas such a right should also be guaranteed to the national of a Member State who, after a period of activity in a self-employed capacity and residence in the territory of a second Member State, pursues an activity in the territory of a third Member State, while still retaining his residence in the territory of the second State;
Whereas, to determine the conditions under which the right to remain arises, account should be taken of the reasons which have led to the termination of activity in the territory of the Member State concerned and, in particular, of the difference between retirement, the normal and foreseeable end of working life, and permanent incapacity to work which leads to a premature and unforeseeable termination  (1)OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.

of activity ; whereas special conditions must be laid down where the spouse is or was a national of the Member State concerned, or where termination of activity is the result of an accident at work or occupational illness;
Whereas a national of a Member State who has reached the end of his working life, after working in a self-employed capacity in the territory of another Member State, should have sufficient time in which to decide where he wishes to establish his final residence;
Whereas the exercise of the right to remain by a national of a Member State working in a self-employed capacity entails extension of such right to the members of his family ; whereas in the case of the death of a national of a Member State working in a self-employed capacity during his working life the right of residence of the members of his family must also be recognized and be the subject of special conditions;
Whereas persons to whom the right to remain applies must enjoy equality of treatment with nationals of the State concerned who have reached the end of their working lives,","{'title': 'Council Directive 75/34/EEC of 17 December 1974 concerning the right of nationals of a Member State to remain in the territory of another Member State after having pursued therein an activity in a self-employed capacity', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMember States shall, under the conditions laid down in this Directive, abolish restrictions on the right to remain in their territory in favour of nationals of another Member State who have pursued activities as self-employed persons in their territory, and members of their families, as defined in Article 1 of Directive No 73/148/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 (2) sets detailed rules covering export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Under Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 refunds can be granted on products exported by the Community, to the extent necessary to enable economically significant quantities to be exported and within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) In line with Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 care should be taken to ensure that trade flows already engendered by the granting of refunds are not disturbed. For that reason and given the seasonal nature of fruit and vegetable exports quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3).

(5) Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires Community market prices to be determined using the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation.
(6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may necessitate differentiation of the refund on a given product by destination.
(7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of shelled almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts in shell.
(8) Since nuts have a relatively long storage life export refunds can be set at longer intervals.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 3(3)(a) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 95/45/EC of 26 July 1995 laying down specific purity criteria concerning colours for use in foodstuffs (2), sets out the purity criteria for the colours mentioned in Directive 94/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs (3).
(2) Sunset yellow FCF (E 110) is authorised under Directive 94/36/EC as a colour for use in certain foodstuffs. There is scientific evidence that under certain circumstances, Sudan I (1-(phenylazo)-2-naphthalenol) may be formed as an impurity during the production of sunset yellow. Sudan I is an unauthorised colour and an undesired substance in food. Its presence in sunset yellow should therefore be restricted to an amount below the limit of detection, i.e. 0,5 mg/kg. The purity criteria for sunset yellow FCF (E 110) should therefore be amended accordingly.
(3) Account should be taken of the specifications and analytical techniques for additives set out in the Codex Alimentarius as drafted by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). JECFA began the implementation of a systematic programme to replace the test for heavy metals (as lead) in all existing food additive specifications with appropriate limits for individual metals of concern. These limits for sunset yellow FCF (E 110) should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4) Titanium dioxide (E 171) is authorised under Directive 94/36/EC as a colour for use in certain foodstuffs. Titanium dioxide can be manufactured to obtain crystals in the anatase or in the rutile form. The platelet form of rutile titanium dioxide differs from the anatase form in structure and optical properties (pearlescence). There is a technological need for the use of the platelet form of rutile titanium dioxide as a colour in foodstuffs and in film coatings for food supplement tablets. On 7 December 2004 the European Food Safety Authority stated that the use of rutile titanium dioxide in the platelet or amorphous forms would not pose any safety concerns. The purity criteria for titanium dioxide (E 171) should therefore be amended in order to include both the anatase and the rutile form of the substance.
(5) Directive 95/45/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes thiabendazole.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, thiabendazole has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(3) Spain was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 9 May 2006 in accordance with 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 22 February 2008, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing thiabendazole may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include thiabendazole in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing thiabendazole can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) However, unacceptable risks were identified for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood exposed to weathering. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.
(7) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing thiabendazole and used as wood preservatives to ensure that risks are reduced to an acceptable level in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC and Annex VI thereto. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks in these compartments have been identified during the evaluation and products intended for industrial and/or professional use should be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for industrial and/or professional users cannot be reduced by other means.
(8) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance thiabendazole and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(10) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing thiabendazole to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.
(11) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2011/2003(2) and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Cefquinome and Imidocarb should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC(3) of the European Parliament and of the Council to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) The second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic (2) approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC (3), a certain amount of Community milk products exported to the Dominican Republic can benefit from reduced customs duties.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

derogating in respect of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba from Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3749/83 on the definition of the concept of originating products for the purposes of the application of tariff preferences granted by the European Economic Community in respect of certain products from developing countries
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3599/85 of 17 December 1985 applying generalized tariff preferences for 1986 in respect of certain industrial products originating in developing countries (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3600/85 of 17 December 1985 applying generalized tariff preferences for 1986 to textile products originating in developing countries (2), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3601/85 of 17 December 1985 applying generalized tariff preferences for 1986 in respect of certain agricultural products originating in developing countries (3), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas Decision 85/553/ECSC of the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community, meeting within the Council, of 17 December 1985 applying for 1986 the generalized tariff preferences for certain steel products originating in developing countries (4), stipulates that the definition of the origin of products shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 802/68 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1318/71 (6); whereas the rules to be applied in this connection must be the same as those provided for in respect of the other products;
Whereas, for the purpose of implementing the provisions concerning the tariff preferences granted by the European Economic Community, in respect of certain products originating in developing countries, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3749/83 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1968/86 (8), established rules of origin governing the conditions under which such products may acquire the status of originating products, and also the procedures concerning proof of origin and verification of originating status;
Whereas trade cooperation has become established between the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba and certain developing countries and territories enjoying generalized tariff preferences, as listed in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 3599/85, hereinafter referred to as 'countries enjoying generalized tariff preferences'; whereas under this cooperation products originating in the said countries are imported into the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba and subjected to working insufficient to confer originating status before being forwarded to the European Economic Community; whereas this cooperation would be affected by the application of the provisions on the transport of originating products laid down in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 3749/83; whereas the said provisions should therefore be amended so that the originating products in question will be eligible for the tariff preferences on presentation of a Form A certificate of origin issued in the Netherlands Antilles or in Aruba;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV.6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 96/317/EC of 13 May 1996 concerning the conclusion of the results of consultations with Thailand under GATT Article XXIII (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (3), and in particular Articles 10(2) and 13(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (4) applies to import licences for tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed rules for applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It limits the period of validity of import licences to the final day of the tariff quota period and applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down by the sectoral regulations.
(3) Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 2058/96 of 28 October 1996 opening and providing for the management of a tariff quota for broken rice of CN code 1006 40 00 for production of food preparations of CN code 1901 10 (5), 327/98 of 10 February 1998 opening and providing for the administration of certain tariff quotas for imports of rice and broken rice (6) and 955/2005 of 23 June 2005 opening a Community import quota for rice originating in Egypt (7) contain provisions which diverge from or repeat the common rules laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. Those Regulations should therefore be amended with a view to removing the differing or redundant rules, specifying the serial numbers of each quota and subquota and redefining the specific rules which apply, in particular to the drawing up of licence applications, their issue, their period of validity and the notification of information to the Commission.
(4) In the interests of harmonising and simplifying the above Regulations, provisions which are already contained in the horizontal or sectoral implementing regulations, that is, apart from Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (8), and 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (9), should be deleted, as should provisions which no longer apply.
(5) In the interests of simplification, provision should be made for quantities of less than 20 tonnes allocated following the application of an award coefficient to be administered in the same way in Regulations (EC) Nos 2058/96, 327/98 and 955/2005.
(6) In the interests of improved administration of the tariff quotas opened by Regulations (EC) Nos 2058/96 and 955/2005, it is necessary to continue to allow operators to submit more than one licence application per quota period, and therefore to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. Moreover, in order to improve controls on these two quotas and to harmonise and simplify their administration, provision should be made for import licence applications to be submitted on a weekly basis.
(7) The import duty on broken rice is laid down in Article 11d of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003; therefore reference should no longer be made to the combined nomenclature and Regulation (EC) No 2058/96 should be amended accordingly.
(8) For those quotas opened by Regulation (EC) No 327/98 which are administered on the basis of an export certificate, it is necessary to continue to allow operators with more than one export certificate to submit more than one import licence application per quota subperiod, and therefore to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, in order to ensure controls adapted to such imports. The amount of the security relating to the import licences for husked rice provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 327/98 should moreover be aligned with the amount of the security provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1342/2003.
(9) With regard to Regulation (EC) No 955/2005, the references to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 should be made clearer and it should be specified that the period of validity of the licence is calculated from the actual day of issue of the licence.
(10) These measures should be applied from 1 January 2007, which is the date from which the measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 apply.
(11) However, the period for lodging the first applications referred to in Regulations (EC) Nos 2058/96 and 955/2005 falls on a public holiday in 2007; it should therefore be laid down that the first applications may be lodged by operators only from the first working day of 2007, and that this first period for lodging applications closes no later than Monday 8 January 2007. It should also be specified that import licence applications for this first period should be sent to the Commission no later than Monday 8 January 2007.
(12) Regulations (EC) Nos 2058/96, 327/98 and 955/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas the classification of vine varieties approved for cultivation in the Community was last determined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3800/81 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1871/85 (4);

Whereas the classification of wine grape and table grape vine varieties should now include, among the varieties recommended or authorized for certain French administrative units, certain varieties which have been listed for at least five years in the category for an administrative unit immediately bordering thereon and which therefore satisfy the condition laid down in the first indent of Article 11 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;
Whereas the classification should now also include two wine grape vine varieties which have been examined and found to be satisfactory for cultivation; whereas, in accordance with Article 11 (1) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79, these varieties may be authorized on a provisional basis for the United Kingdom;
Whereas the suitability for cultivation of one authorized French wine grape vine variety is not satisfactory; whereas this variety should therefore be deleted from the classification in accordance with Article 11 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 347/79;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits should be established for all pharmacologically active substances that are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the relevant food obtained from the treated animal (‘target tissue’) as well as the nature of the residue that is relevant for the monitoring of residues (‘marker residue’).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 provides that the establishment of maximum residue limits shall in no way prejudice the application of other relevant Community legislation.
(7) Based on an opinion of the CVMP, Annex III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 997/1999 (2) to include provisional maximum residue limits for morantel, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, notably concerning the marker residue and the analytical method for the determination of residues of morantel in the target tissues. These maximum residue limits were subsequently extended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1322/2001 (3) to allow the applicant further time for completion of the requested studies.
(8) The requested data on the marker residue and the analytical method was evaluated by the CVMP and found to be not completely in accordance with the requirements laid down in Volume 8 of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Union. The method was nevertheless considered fully validated for muscle and milk and either kidney or liver for the species cattle and sheep. The CVMP subsequently proposed to insert morantel in Annex II of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, with the motivation that residues of morantel depleted rapidly and therefore the establishment of maximum residue limits was not necessary for the protection of public health.
(9) As residues of morantel in foodstuff from treated animals may supersede the acceptable daily intake 24 hours after administration, it is considered necessary, for reasons of consumer safety and to allow adequate withdrawal periods to be established for veterinary medicinal products containing morantel, to establish maximum residues limits, taking account of the maximum residue limits previously established.
(10) Morantel is a pharmacologically active anthelmintic substance which has been in use in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animal species for a considerable time for treatment against roundworms and tapeworms. In view of the possible development of resistance, it is considered that access to multiple choices for treatment should remain possible.
(11) According to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 (4), risk management shall take into account the results of risk assessment and other factors legitimate to the matter under consideration, such as detection methods and feasibility of controls for the purpose of avoiding risks from such substances. The relevant Community Reference Laboratory has confirmed that the methods proposed by the applicant can be made applicable for confirmatory analyses of morantel in the target tissues.
(12) The Commission considers that it is appropriate to include morantel in Annex I for cattle and sheep to provide safeguards for the consumer and to allow relevant controls of morantel in foodstuffs of treated animals.
(13) A period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustments which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (5).
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products.","{'header': '26.10.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 323/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1851/2004\nof 25 October 2004\namending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits for veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits should be established for all pharmacologically active substances that are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.\n\n((2)) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.\n\n((3)) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the relevant food obtained from the treated animal (‘target tissue’) as well as the nature of the residue that is relevant for the monitoring of residues (‘marker residue’).\n\n((4)) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney.

(1) Directive 64/432/EEC lays down rules for trade within the Union in bovine animals. Article 9 thereof provides that a Member State which has a compulsory national control programme for one of the contagious diseases listed in Annex E(II) thereto, may submit its programme to the Commission for approval. That list includes infectious bovine rhinotracheitis. Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is the description of the most prominent clinical signs of the infection with the bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV1).
(2) Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.
(3) In addition, Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC provides that where a Member State considers that its territory or part thereof is free from one of the diseases listed in Annex E(II) to that Directive, it is to present appropriate supporting documentation to the Commission. That Article also provides for the definition of the additional guarantees which may be required in intra-Union trade.
(4) Commission Decision 2004/558/EC (2) approves the programmes for the control and eradication of BHV1 presented by the Member States listed in Annex I thereto for the regions listed in that Annex and for which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 64/432/EEC.
(5) In addition, Annex II to Decision 2004/558/EC lists the regions of the Member States that are considered free of BHV1 and to which additional guarantees apply in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 64/432/EEC.
(6) Belgium has submitted to the Commission a programme with the aim of eradicating BHV1 infection in the whole of its territory. That programme complies with the criteria set out in Article 9(1) of Directive 64/432/EEC. That programme also provides for rules for the national movement of bovine animals which are equivalent to those previously implemented in certain Member States or regions thereof, which were successful in eradicating the disease in those Member States or regions.
(7) Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) All regions of Germany, with the exception of the Federal State of Bavaria, are currently listed in Annex I to Decision 2004/558/EC. The Federal State of Bavaria is free of BHV1 and is therefore listed in Annex II to that Decision.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota of 42 600 head of heifers and cows, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain mountain breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the European Economic Community undertook, within the framework of GATT, to open an annual Community tariff quota of 20 000 head at a duty of 6 % for heifers and cows, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain mountain breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas eligibility for such quota is subject to conditions to be determined by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination; whereas, in an Exchange of Letters with Austria dated 21 July 1972, the Community undertook unilaterally to increase the size of the tariff quota from 20 000 to 30 000 head and to lower the quota duty from 6 to 4 %; whereas, subsequently, this quota was increased unilaterally to 38 000 head;
Whereas according to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters of 14 July 1986, which was adopted by Decision 86/555/EEC (1), the volume of this tariff quota was raised to 42 600 head as from 1 July 1986; whereas the abovementioned tariff quota for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 should therefore be opened at a duty of 4 % in relation to a quantity of 42 600 head; whereas, however, under the terms of Article 282 of the 1985 Act of Accession, the Portuguese Republic is authorized to postpone, until the beginning of the second stage, the progressive application to imports of preferences granted, unilaterally or by agreement, by the Community to certain third countries;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and continuous access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and the uninterrupted application of the quota duties, to all imports of the animals in question until the quota is exhausted; whereas, having regard to the principles defined above, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas possibilities for the use of such mountain breeds are, however, limited by special factors, both geographical and zootechnical; whereas certain Member States do not have regions suitable for breeding this kind of cattle; whereas, however, in view of such special factors, the Community nature of the tariff quota in question should be preserved by making provision for requirements which may arise in these Member States; whereas, to this end, these Member States proceed to draw adequate shares from the Community reserve which has been set up; whereas, in order to reflect as closely as possible the actual trend of the market in question, the initial allocation must be made in proportion to the requirements of each of the Member States concerned, calculated in accordance with statistical data concerning imports from third countries during a representative reference period and with economic prospects for the quota period in question;
Whereas, since the animals in question belong to certain specific breeds which are not specified as such in the statistical nomenclatures of the Member States, no data on imports provided by the Member States could be considered to be sufficiently accurate and representative to be used as a basis for the allocation in question; whereas the extent to which Community tariff quotas for those animals in the Community have been exhausted and the estimates made by certain Member States enable the requirements of each of them as regards imports from third countries for the quota period envisaged to be assessed as follows:
Germany 20 000 head
France 1 800 head
Italy 16 000 head
Greece 3 000 head;
whereas in the absence of precise information, the needs of the Benelux countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain may be assessed at 100, 50, 50 and 100 head respectively;
Whereas, in order to take into account the possible trend of imports of the aforementioned animals into the said Member States, the quota amount of 42 600 head should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States, the second forming a reserve intended subsequently to cover the requirements of those Member States when their initial shares are exhausted and requirements which arise within other Member States; whereas, in order to ensure a certain degree of security for importers in the aforementioned Member States, the first part of the Community quota should be determined at a level which, under the present circumstances, may be approximately 76 % of the quota amount;
Whereas the initial shares of those Member States may be used up more or less rapidly; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, it is important that the Member States having used up almost the whole of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each of these Member States as and when each of its additional shares is almost entirely used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be available until the end of the quota period; whereas such method of administration calls for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission, which latter must, in particular, be able to observe the extent to which the quota are used and inform Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a specified date within the quota period, a considerable balance of the initial share of one or other of the Member States is left over, it is essential that that State should return a considerable part of such balance to the reserve in order that part of the Community tariff quota should not remain unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas it is possible that, during the period of applicability of the said quota, the nomenclature used by the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1706/88 of 13 June 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota of 42 600 head of heifers and cows, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain mountain breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) sets maximum levels for mycotoxins in food.
(2) The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (The Panel on Contaminants) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has, on a request from the Commission, adopted on 2 March 2012 an opinion on the risks for public and animal health related to the presence of citrinin in food and feed (3). The Panel on Contaminants decided to characterise the risk of citrinin on the available data on nephrotoxicity and determined a level of no concern for nephrotoxicity. Applying an uncertainty factor of 100 to the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 20 μg/kg bodyweight (b.w.) per day results in a level of no concern for nephrotoxicity in humans of 0,2 μg/kg b.w. per day. The Panel on Contaminants concluded that based on the available data, a concern for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity could not be excluded as regards citrinin at the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity.
(3) The Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (The NDA Panel) of EFSA has, on request of the Competent Authority of the Netherlands following an application by Sylvan Bio Europe BV, adopted on 24 January 2013 an opinion on the substantiation of a health claim related to monacolin K in SYLVAN BIO red yeast rice and maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentration pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 (4). The NDA Panel concluded that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of monacolin K in red yeast rice preparations and maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The NDA Panel considers that the following wording reflects the scientific evidence: ‘Monacolin K from red yeast rice contributes to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations’ and in order to obtain the claimed effect, 10 mg of monacolin K from fermented red yeast rice preparations should be consumed daily. The target population is adults in the general population. The health claim can be applied to all red yeast rice preparations on the market.
(4) Monacolin K is produced by Monascus purpureus of which some strains produce also citrinin. Data available on the presence of citrinin in certain red yeast rice preparations revealed high levels of citrinin in those preparations. The consumption of such red yeast rice preparations at the quantity necessary to obtain the claimed effect would result in an exposure significantly above the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity of citrinin. Therefore it is appropriate to establish a maximum level for citrinin in red yeast rice preparations. To obtain the necessary intake of monacolin K, 4-6 capsules of 600 mg of red yeast rice need to be consumed. A maximum level of 2 mg/kg for citrinin in red yeast rice preparation has been established in order to ensure that the possible exposure to citrinin from these red yeast rice preparations remains significantly below the level of nephrotoxicity of 0,2 μg/kg bw foe an adult. Given the gaps in knowledge as regards the presence of citrinin in other foodstuffs and the remaining uncertainties as regards the carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of citrinin, it is appropriate to review the maximum level within two years’ time once more information has been gathered as regards the toxicity of citrinin and the exposure from other foodstuffs.
(5) The addition of substances to or the use of substances in foodstuffs is governed by specific Union and national legislation, as is the classification of products as foodstuffs or medicinal products.

The Panel on Contaminants decided to characterise the risk of citrinin on the available data on nephrotoxicity and determined a level of no concern for nephrotoxicity. Applying an uncertainty factor of 100 to the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of 20\xa0μg/kg bodyweight (b.w.) per day results in a level of no concern for nephrotoxicity in humans of 0,2\xa0μg/kg b.w. per day. The Panel on Contaminants concluded that based on the available data, a concern for genotoxicity and carcinogenicity could not be excluded as regards citrinin at the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity.\n\n((3)) The Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (The NDA Panel) of EFSA has, on request of the Competent Authority of the Netherlands following an application by Sylvan Bio Europe BV, adopted on 24 January 2013 an opinion on the substantiation of a health claim related to monacolin K in SYLVAN BIO red yeast rice and maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentration pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006(4). The NDA Panel concluded that a cause and effect relationship has been established between the consumption of monacolin K in red yeast rice preparations and maintenance of normal blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The NDA Panel considers that the following wording reflects the scientific evidence: ‘Monacolin K from red yeast rice contributes to the maintenance of normal blood cholesterol concentrations’ and in order to obtain the claimed effect, 10\xa0mg of monacolin K from fermented red yeast rice preparations should be consumed daily. The target population is adults in the general population. The health claim can be applied to all red yeast rice preparations on the market.\n\n((4)) Monacolin K is produced byMonascus purpureusof which some strains produce also citrinin. Data available on the presence of citrinin in certain red yeast rice preparations revealed high levels of citrinin in those preparations. The consumption of such red yeast rice preparations at the quantity necessary to obtain the claimed effect would result in an exposure significantly above the level of no concern for nephrotoxicity of citrinin. Therefore it is appropriate to establish a maximum level for citrinin in red yeast rice preparations. To obtain the necessary intake of monacolin K, 4-6 capsules of 600\xa0mg of red yeast rice need to be consumed. A maximum level of 2\xa0mg/kg for citrinin in red yeast rice preparation has been established in order to ensure that the possible exposure to citrinin from these red yeast rice preparations remains significantly below the level of nephrotoxicity of 0,2\xa0μg/kg bw foe an adult. Given the gaps in knowledge as regards the presence of citrinin in other foodstuffs and the remaining uncertainties as regards the carcinogenicity and genotoxicity of citrinin, it is appropriate to review the maximum level within two years’ time once more information has been gathered as regards the toxicity of citrinin and the exposure from other foodstuffs.\n\n((5)) The addition of substances to or the use of substances in foodstuffs is governed by specific Union and national legislation, as is the classification of products as foodstuffs or medicinal products. The setting of a maximum level in such a substance or product does not constitute an authorisation to the marketing of the substance for which a maximum level is established, a decision on whether the substance can be used in foodstuffs, or a classification of a certain product as a foodstuff.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nIn section 2 of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006, the following entries 2.8 and 2.8.1 are added:\nFoodstuffs (\n1\n)\nMaximum levels (μg/kg)\n‘2.8\nCitrinin\n2.8.1\nFood supplements based on rice fermented with red yeast\nMonascus purpureus\n2\xa0000\n(\n*1\n)'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Entry into force and application', 'text': 'Article 2\nEntry into force and application\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union.\nIt shall apply from 1 April 2014.'}]}"

COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 79/2013
of 28 January 2013
making imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia subject to registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 10(4) and 14(5) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) On 29 August 2012, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2) (‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia (‘the countries concerned’) following a complaint lodged on 17 July 2012 by the European Biodiesel Board (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing more than 25 % of the total Union production of biodiesel.
A.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(2) The product concerned by this registration is the same as that defined in the notice of initiation, i.e. fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, currently falling within CN codes ex 1516 20 98, ex 1518 00 91, ex 1518 00 95, ex 1518 00 99, ex 2710 19 43, ex 2710 19 46, ex 2710 19 47, 2710 20 11, 2710 20 15, 2710 20 17, ex 3824 90 97, 3826 00 10 and ex 3826 00 90, and originating in Argentina and Indonesia.
B.   REQUEST
(3) Following the publication of the notice of initiation, the complainant requested in September 2012 that imports of the product concerned are made subject to registration pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration.
C.   GROUNDS FOR THE REGISTRATION
(4) According to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, direct the customs authorities to take the appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports may be made subject to registration following a request from the Union industry which contains sufficient evidence to justify such action.
(5) The complainant claimed that registration is justified as the product concerned was dumped and injury to the Union industry was caused by the surge in dumped imports in a relatively short period of time.
(6) As regards dumping, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of the product concerned from the countries concerned are being dumped. In the anti-dumping complaint and request for registration, the evidence regarding export prices from both countries, based on Eurostat data, covers the period from April 2011 to March 2012. The evidence regarding normal value, contained in the anti-dumping complaint and request for registration, consists for both countries of domestic prices. The complainant also provided a constructed normal value based on total cost of production plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative expenses and for profits. Indeed it has been argued that the export taxes on the soybean oil or palm oil, in Argentina and Indonesia respectively, distort the domestic market by lowering the raw materials prices. As a whole, and given the extent of the dumping margin alleged, this evidence provides sufficient support at this stage that the exporters in question practice dumping.
(7) As regards injury, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the exporters’ dumping practices are causing material injury. This evidence consists of detailed data, contained in the anti-dumping complaint and request for registration and supported by information from the industry and public sources, concerning the key injury factors set out in Article 3(5) of the basic Regulation.
(8) The Commission also has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence, contained in the anti-dumping complaint and request for registration and supported by information from other sources, that the importers were aware, or should have been aware, that the exporters practice dumping injurious to or likely to be injurious to the Union. Several articles in the specialist press over an extended period of time suggested that the Union industry may have been suffering injury as a result of low priced imports from Argentina and Indonesia. Finally, given the extent of the dumping that may be occurring, it is reasonable to conclude that the importers would be aware, or should be aware, of the situation.
(9) Furthermore, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that such injury is being caused or would be caused by massive dumped imports in a relatively short time which in light of the timing and the volume of the dumped imports and other circumstances (such as the rapid build-up of inventories) would be likely to seriously undermine the remedial effect of any definitive anti-dumping duties, unless such duties would be applied retroactively. The level of imports of biodiesel from Argentina and Indonesia reaches a peak during spring and summer as, due to its physical and chemical properties, the use of these products is limited when temperatures are low. In view of the initiation of the current proceeding, it is likely that the exporting producers will negotiate contracts with EU importers for sales of increased volumes of biodiesel prior to the adoption of provisional measures, if any, and inventories will be rapidly built up by importers. The period prior to the initiation also showed a strong increase of imports.
D.   PROCEDURE
(10) In view of the above, the Commission has concluded that the complainant provided sufficient evidence to justify making imports of the product concerned subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(11) All interested parties are invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
E.   REGISTRATION
(12) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings leading to the imposition of anti-dumping duties, those duties, can, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, be levied retroactively in accordance with applicable legal provisions.
(13) Any future liability would emanate from the findings of the anti-dumping investigation. The allegations in the complaint requesting the initiation of an investigation mentions dumping margins ranging between 18 and 29 % for Indonesia, between 40 and 50 % for Argentina, and injury margins between 28,5 and 29,5 % for Argentina and between 35,5 and 37,5 % for Indonesia.
(14) In order that the registration is sufficiently effective in view of eventual retroactive levying of an anti-dumping duty, the declarant should indicate on the customs declaration the proportion in blends, by weight, of the total content of fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and of paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin (biodiesel content).

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Measures in force
(1) Following an investigation (the original investigation), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 14,9 % on imports of certain aluminium foil (AHF) originating in Russia. Following the acceptance of an undertaking from the Russian exporting producer ‘United Company Siberian Aluminium’, joint stock company, which has since changed its name (3) to Open Joint Stock Company Rusal Sayanal (Sayanal), imports from this exporter were exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Commission Decision 2001/381/EC (4).
2.   Request for an interim review
(2) A request for a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 was received from Sayanal, an exporting producer of AHF subject to a price undertaking and part of the Russian Aluminium group of companies (Rusal).
(3) In its request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, Sayanal claimed that the circumstances with regard to dumping, on the basis of which the measures in force were established, had changed and that these changes were of a lasting nature. Sayanal further alleged and provided prima facie evidence to show that a comparison of normal value based on its own costs or domestic prices and export prices to the Community would lead to a reduction of dumping significantly below the level of the current measures (14,9 %). Therefore it claimed that the continued imposition of measures at the existing levels, which were based on the level of dumping previously established, was no longer necessary to offset dumping.
3.   Initiation
(4) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (5), initiated a partial interim review limited in scope to the examination of dumping in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation and commenced its investigation.
(5) The Commission officially advised the applicant, as well as the representatives of the exporting country, of the initiation of the interim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(6) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a reply within the deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the determination of dumping and carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies:
— Sayanal, Sayanogorsk, Russia, and its related companies within the Rusal group:
— SAZ, Sayanogorsk, Russia (aluminium smelter),
— Rusal Sayanskaya Folga, Dmitrov, Russia (processor of small rolls),
— Trading House Russian Foil, Moscow, Russia,
— Trading House Safoil, Moscow, Russia,
— Rual Trade (BVI) Limited, Moscow, Russia,
— Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH, Düsseldorf, Germany.
4.   Review investigation period
(7) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 (the investigation period or IP).
B.   PRODUCT CONCERNED AND LIKE PRODUCT
1.   Product concerned
(8) The product concerned by the current review is the same as that defined in the original investigation, i.e. certain aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,009 mm and not more than 0,018 mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in reels of a width not exceeding 650 mm originating in Russia, currently classifiable under CN code 7607 11 10.
2.   Like product
(9) Unlike in the previous investigation, Sayanal and its related companies sold AHF also on the Russian domestic market. Whereas the product concerned sold to the EC is in the form of ‘jumbo reels’, sales on the Russian domestic market were in the form of ‘small rolls’. Small rolls are processed from jumbo reels, by cutting them to smaller lengths and packaging them for sale to end-users. However, it was found that AHF in jumbo reels and small rolls both shared the same physical and chemical characteristics and uses.
(10) Consequently, both AHF produced and sold on the Russian domestic market and that exported to the Community have the same basic physical and chemical characteristics and uses and are therefore considered to be alike within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1.   Normal value
(11) Sales on the domestic market are made by Sayanal via Trading House Russian Foil (THRF) to Rusal Sayanskaya Folga (RSF), which processes the jumbo reels into small rolls and then sells them to independent customers within Russia.
(12) There are no sales of jumbo reels to independent customers in Russia, and no representative sales of small rolls to independent customers in the Community. As such, no proper comparison on a model-to-model basis could be made. Therefore normal value was constructed according to Article 2(3) of the basic Regulation on the basis of the company’s cost of production plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs (SG&A) and for profits.
(13) Article 2(5) of the basic Regulation provides for the cost of manufacturing to be adjusted where ‘costs associated with the production and sale of the product under investigation are not reasonably reflected in the records of the party concerned’.
(14) The investigation established that the related smelting company was charged a very low price for its electricity, which is generated at the Sayano-Shushenskoe Hydro-Electricity Plant, compared to prices charged in third countries with comparable hydro-electricity plants. The prices are set by the Regional Energy Commission. These prices were considered abnormally low and not reflecting the normal costs. Therefore they were adjusted on the basis of the 2004 price of electricity for energy-intensive manufacturing in another representative market, i.e. Norway, which was found to be EUR 14/MWh.
(15) As regards the SG&A, they were determined on the basis of the company’s own data pursuant to the chapeau of Article 2(6) of the basic Regulation. However, an adjustment was necessary in order to reflect the fact that, as pointed out in recital 12, the company does not sell the same type of AHF rolls on the EC and Russian markets and that, in addition, these types are sold at a different level of trade.
(16) For the same reason, the profit on domestic sales had to be adjusted as well. In order to make such adjustment, and given the existence of intra-group transfer prices, it was considered appropriate to determine the profit on the basis of the profit margin (32,1 %) found for the audited consolidated accounts of the Rusal Group, expressed as a percentage of total costs.
2.   Export price
(17) Sales to the EU are made through a series of sales companies within the Rusal group: THRF, Trading House Safoil (Safoil), Rual Trade (BVI) Limited (Rual) and Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH (SAG).
(18) Where sales were made via a related importer in the Community, the export price was constructed on the basis of the resale prices to independent customers. Adjustments were made for all costs incurred between importation and resale by that importer, including SG&A expenses, and a reasonable profit margin, in accordance with Article 2(9) of the basic Regulation. The latter was based on the profit margin found for an unrelated importer in the previous investigation.
(19) For sales made through a related company outside the Community, the export price was established on the basis of the resale price paid by the first independent buyer in the Community.
3.   Comparison
(20) The comparison of the export price with the constructed normal value was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. In order to ensure a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability. On this basis, allowances for differences in transport costs, handling costs, insurance and duty payments were made, where applicable, and justified. Adjustments were also made where the export sales were made via a related company located in a country other than the country concerned or the Community, pursuant to Article 2(10)(i) of the basic Regulation.
4.   Dumping margin
(21) As provided for under Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation, the weighted average constructed normal value by type was compared with the weighted average net ex-works export price of the corresponding type of the product concerned.
(22) The comparison as described above did not show the existence of any dumping.
D.   LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES
(23) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature.
(24) In this respect, it was considered first of all that Sayanal has complied with its price undertaking through its subsidiary sales company in the Community, Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH (SAG), since the imposition of measures. At the same time, Sayanal has retained a substantial share of the Community market, indicating that it is able to compete at non-dumped price levels.
(25) The prices of the product concerned sold on third-country markets were also examined in order to assess the behaviour of the company in markets where no trade defence measures are in force. It was found that these prices were only slightly below the current export prices to the Community, and no indications of dumping on these markets were found. It is therefore considered that there is no reason to believe that this change of circumstances and the findings on the absence of dumping would not be of a lasting nature.
E.   ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
(26) As a result of the investigation it is considered appropriate to amend the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of AHF from Sayanal.
(27) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to recommend an amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 and were given an opportunity to comment. Their comments were considered and taken into account where appropriate,","{'header': '31.1.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 26/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 161/2006\nof 23 January 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain aluminium foil originating,inter alia, in Russia', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nIn Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 the table shall be replaced by the following:\n‘Country\nCompany\nRate of duty\n(%)\nTARIC additional code\nThe PRC\nAll companies\n15,0\n—\nRussia\nOpen Joint Stock Company Rusal Sayanal, Promploshadka, Sayanogorsk, Republic of Khakasia 655600, Russia\n0\nA255\nAll other companies\n14,9\nA999 ’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nArticles 1(3) and 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 are hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law; these are essential elements of the Agreement and thus form the basis for relations between us.\nIn its statement of 3 August 2005 on the coup in Mauritania, the EU reiterated its condemnation of all attempts to seize power by force, and called for respect for democracy and a return to constitutional order.\nUnder Article 96 of the revised Cotonou Agreement, and considering that the\ncoup d’État\nthat took place on 3 August 2005 constituted a violation of certain essential elements listed in that Article, the EU invited Mauritania to consultations in order, as provided for in the Agreement, to study the situation in depth and, where necessary, take steps to remedy it.\nThese consultations began in Brussels on 30 November 2005. Mauritania gave a presentation based on a memorandum dated 24 November 2005 on developments in the country’s situation since the coup of 3 August, and on the authorities’ programme for the transitional period.\nFor its part, the EU was pleased to note that Mauritania had already confirmed a number of undertakings it had previously given, and had proposed positive steps regarding their implementation.\nAs noted below, Mauritania gave 23 specific undertakings at the meeting, in the areas of respect for democratic principles, fundamental freedoms and rights, the rule of law and good governance. The country also promised to provide the EU with a report on the implementation of these undertakings by mid-January 2006, to be followed by regular quarterly reports on developments in the situation.\nThe report submitted in mid-January allowed the EU to conclude that steady progress had been made. In addition to the progress already noted at the opening of consultations, a number of changes have been observed, particularly regarding:\n—\ndefining the procedures for the administrative survey for electoral purposes, to compile electoral rolls that are reliable and transparent,\n—\nthe adoption by the Council of Ministers of the draft law on Constitutional amendments to be submitted to a referendum,\n—\nthe appointment of new\nWalis\n(regional governors) and\nHakems\n(prefects), and a circular sent to local and regional authorities when they take office about the neutrality of the central and territorial administration,\n—\nthe development of a programme to raise awareness of civic issues and instil civic values, and the launch of a civic awareness campaign attended by the government authorities, the National Independent Electoral Commission, political parties, civil society organisations and the press,\n—\nthe creation of a working party under the Justice Minister to verify the constitutionality of texts on democratic freedoms and rights, and to make any proposals necessary,\n—\nthe establishing by decree and the setting up of a National Consultative Commission for the reform of the press and the audiovisual sector,\n—\nthe organisation of a workshop on the creation of a National Independent Human Rights Commission,\n—\ncirculars sent by the Justice Ministry and the Ministry of the Interior to the prosecution service and the territorial administration authorities asking them to seek, detect and prosecute any cases that might involve the direct or indirect exploitation of persons,\n—\nthe adoption by the Council of Ministers of draft ordinances authorising accession to the UN Convention against Corruption, and authorising the ratification of the African Convention against Corruption,\n—\nthe creation of a temporary committee to monitor the application of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and the adoption of a draft decree on the creation, organisation and workings of the National EITI Committee.\nThe initiatives introduced by the transitional authorities will undoubtedly help strengthen the respect for democratic principles, fundamental freedoms and rights, the rule of law and good governance in your country. However, most of the undertakings made at the outset of the consultations will be implemented over an extended period, and it will be necessary to monitor their implementation over time.\nIn this connection, the EU is anxious that the implementation of substantive measures should continue, in particular through,\n—\nthe organisation and holding of free and transparent elections using electoral rolls that are reliable and complete, using electoral systems and constituency weightings that are fair and agreed with the political parties,\n—\nrespect for pluralism in the audiovisual sector, and, in particular, the creation of free radio stations outside cities, and the revision of the press law,\n—\npromoting human rights, especially through continued efforts to create a national independent human rights commission, the return of refugees and the restoration of their rights,\n—\napplication of the laws banning slavery and promising appropriate treatment for all problems arising from this evil,\n—\nreform of the justice system,\n—\ncontinued improvements in governance, including the publication of updated economic and budgetary statistical data,\n—\neffective implementation of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the mining and hydrocarbon sectors and the application of the same good governance principles in the other natural resource sectors, in particular, as regards fisheries.\nIn the spirit of partnership that underlies the Cotonou Agreement, the EU expressed its readiness to support implementation of Mauritania’s undertakings. In follow-up to the consultations, and in view of the undertakings given thus far and the measures still to be put in hand, it has been decided to adopt the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the revised Cotonou Agreement:\n—\ncooperation activities under way under the Ninth European Development Fund (EDF) and its predecessors will continue, on condition that the special conditions of the Financing Agreements are observed,\n—\npreparation and implementation of the institutional support projects bolstering the transition process, whose launch was decided when the consultations opened, will continue,\n—\npreparation and implementation of the measures envisaged under the Ninth EDF and its predecessors in other areas of Community cooperation will also continue,\n—\nprogramming activities for the 10th EDF will be launched in accordance with the timetable drawn up by the relevant Commission departments. Closure of the different stages in the programming process will be conditional on the holding of the referendum on the constitution and the planned elections under satisfactory conditions and within the time-scale fixed by the transitional authorities,\n—\nthe 10th EDF Country Strategy Paper for Mauritania cannot be signed before confirmation that the country has effectively returned to a constitutional order after free and transparent presidential and parliamentary elections have led to new democratically elected bodies taking office.\nThe EU Presidency and the European Commission will carry out regular joint reviews, the first of which will take place within the next six months.\nThe EU will continue to follow closely the situation in Mauritania. Under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, an enhanced political dialogue will be conducted with your government over an 18-month monitoring period to ensure the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, notably through the holding of free and transparent local, parliamentary, senatorial and presidential elections, and a strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\nIf implementation of the Mauritanian authorities’ undertakings speeds up, or on the contrary breaks down, the EU reserves the right to adjust the appropriate measures.\nI have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council'}]}"

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) thereof, in conjunction with the first subparagraph of Article 300(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 16 September 1988, the Member States of the European Communities signed an international agreement with the Republic of Iceland, the Kingdom of Norway and the Swiss Confederation on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (1) (the Lugano Convention), thereby extending to Iceland, Norway and Switzerland the application of the rules of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on the same subject matter (2) (the Brussels Convention).
(2) Negotiations on a revision of the Brussels Convention and the Lugano Convention were undertaken during the years 1998-1999 within the framework of an ad hoc Working Party enlarged with Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. These negotiations led to the adoption of a text of a draft convention prepared by the Working Party, which was confirmed by the Council at its meeting on 27 and 28 May 1999.
(3) Subsequent negotiations within the Council on the basis of this text led to the adoption of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (3), which modernised the rules of the Brussels Convention and made the system of recognition and enforcement swifter and more efficient.
(4) In the light of the parallelism between the Brussels and the Lugano Convention regimes on jurisdiction and on recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, the rules of the Lugano Convention should be aligned with the rules of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 in order to achieve the same level of circulation of judgments between the EU Member States and the EFTA States concerned.
(5) In accordance with the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the application of measures pursuant to Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community. In order for the rules of the Lugano Convention to apply to Denmark, Denmark should therefore participate as a Contracting Party to a new convention covering the same subject matter.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 10(1) to (4) thereof sets out specific provisions for the evaluation of products used in the Union as silage additives at the date that Regulation became applicable.
(2) In accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, a preparation of Lactobacillus buchneri NCIMB 30139 and a preparation of Lactobacillus casei ATTC PTA 6135 were entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as existing products belonging to the functional group of silage additives, for all animal species.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, applications were submitted for the authorisation of those preparations as feed additives for all animal species, requesting those additives to be classified in the category ‘technological additives’ and in the functional group ‘silage additives’. Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinions of 11 September 2012 (2) and 12 September 2012 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparations concerned do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority also concluded that the preparation of Lactobacillus buchneri NCIMB 30139 has the potential to improve the preservation of easy to ensile material by increasing acetic acid production and the preparation of Lactobacillus casei ATTC PTA 6135 has the potential to improve the production of silage from easy to ensile material by reducing the pH and increasing the preservation of dry matter. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the methods of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of the preparations concerned shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '2.2.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 33/21', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 96/2013\nof 1 February 2013\nconcerning the authorisation of a preparation ofLactobacillus buchneriNCIMB 30139 and of a preparation ofLactobacillus caseiATTC PTA 6135 as feed additives for all animal species\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), and in particular Article 247 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 4k to 4t of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 312/2009 (3), provide that economic operators not established in the customs territory of the Community are to be registered by the customs authority or the designated authority of the Member State involved. However, it is necessary to specify that economic operators not established in the customs territory of the Community who lodge a customs declaration in the Community to place goods under the temporary importation procedure will not have to be registered for an economic operators registration and identification number (EORI number) if they discharge that procedure by re-exportation.
(2) Economic operators established in a contracting party to the Convention on a common transit procedure, approved by Council Decision 87/415/EEC (4), other than the European Union lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the common transit procedure and economic operators established in Andorra and San Marino lodging a customs declaration to place goods under the Community transit procedure are already assigned traders’ identification numbers that can be used to identify them. They should therefore be excluded from the obligation to be registered for an EORI number. However, that exception should be limited solely to cases where the data provided in the customs declaration is not used as an entry or exit summary declaration, as an EORI number is important for performing risk analyses in such cases.
(3) In view of Article 186 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 312/2009, Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be adapted.
(4) In order to allow the customs office of the first port or airport of entry to forward, where relevant, information necessary to carry out an appropriate risk analysis to the customs office at any subsequent port or airport as provided for in Article 184e of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, it is necessary to add a new data requirement and the related data explanatory note to Annex 30a to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(5) Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should reflect the fact that in some specific cases duties are imposed under customs union agreements concluded by the European Union.
(6) Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (5) has been repealed. Currently, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1741/2006 (6) lays down the conditions for granting the special export refund on boned meat of adult male bovine animals placed under the customs warehousing procedure prior to export while Commission Regulation (EC) No 1731/2006 (7) lays down special detailed rules for the application of export refunds in the case of certain preserved beef and veal products which require customs supervision and customs control during manufacturing prior to export. Annexes 37 and 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should be updated accordingly.
(7) Article 152(1)(a)a of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 215/2006 (8) provides for a system whereby unit prices notified by Member States and disseminated by the Commission may be used to determine the customs value of certain perishable goods imported on consignment. That system replaces specific rules for the determination of the customs value of certain perishable goods laid down in Articles 173 to 177 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. Annex 38 to that Regulation should therefore be updated.
(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 3223/94 of 21 December 1994 on detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements for fruit and vegetables (9) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1580/2007 of 21 December 2007 laying down implementing rules of Council Regulations (EC) No 2200/96, (EC) No 2201/96 and (EC) No 1182/2007 in the fruit and vegetable sector (10). That replacement should be reflected in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(9) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (11) has been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 612/2009 of 7 July 2009 on laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (12). Box 37 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be adjusted accordingly.
(10) In view of the provisions on simplified procedures set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006 (13), it is necessary to update the codes for ‘Additional information’ in Box 44 of Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, accordingly.
(11) Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) contains an obligation to lodge entry summary declarations and Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006, provides for summary declarations for the purposes of temporary storage. Those two declarations should therefore be included in the ‘List of abbreviations for documents’ in Annex 38 to Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(12) Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 5 May 2000, the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding (2) on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating, inter alia, in Turkey.
(2) This proceeding ultimately resulted in a definitive anti-dumping duty being imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 (3) in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
B.   REQUEST FOR AN INTERIM REVIEW
(3) A request for a partial interim review of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 was received from Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S. (‘Has Çelik’, or ‘the applicant’), a Turkish exporting producer of certain iron or steel ropes and cables subject to the anti-dumping measures in force.
(4) In this request pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation it was claimed that the circumstances with regard to dumping on the basis of which the measures in force were established have changed and that these changes are of a lasting nature.
(5) According to the request, the applicant has undergone structural changes which have had a significant impact on the normal value. Furthermore, it was claimed that a comparison of normal value based on its costs or domestic prices and export prices to the Community would lead to a reduction of dumping significantly below the level of the current measures applying to imports from the applicant, i.e. 17,8 %. Therefore, the continued imposition of measures at the existing levels, which were based on the level of dumping previously established, would no longer be necessary to offset dumping.
(6) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient evidence existed for the initiation of a partial interim review, the Commission published a notice (‘Notice of Initiation’) (4) and commenced an investigation, limited in scope to the examination of dumping by the applicant.
C.   PROCEDURE
(7) The Commission officially advised the representatives of the exporting country and the applicant of the initiation of the partial interim review and gave all the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. A submission was received from EWRIS, the Liaison Committee of E.U. Wire Rope Industries which was the complainant in the original case.
(8) The Commission also sent a questionnaire to the applicant, which replied within the time limits set in the Notice of Initiation.
(9) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of dumping and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant.
(10) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004 (‘the investigation period’).
D.   PRODUCT
Product concerned
(11) The product concerned is the same as in the investigation which lead to the imposition of the existing measures (‘the previous investigation’), i.e. iron or steel ropes and cables, including locked coil ropes, excluding ropes and cables of stainless steel, with a maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeding 3 mm, with fittings attached or not (‘steel wire ropes’ or ‘SWR’), originating in Turkey, currently classifiable within CN codes 7312 10 82, 7312 10 84, 7312 10 86, 7312 10 88 and 7312 10 99.
Like product
(12) As in the previous investigation, this investigation has shown that the SWR produced in Turkey by the applicant and sold on the Turkish market or exported to the Community have the same basic physical characteristics and the same uses, and therefore are to be considered a like product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation.
E.   DUMPING
Normal value
(13) As far as the determination of normal value is concerned, it was first established whether the applicant's total domestic sales of the like product were representative in comparison with its total export sales to the Community. In accordance with Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation this was found to be the case since its domestic sales volume constituted at least 5 % of its total export sales volume to the Community.
(14) For each of the types sold by the applicant on its domestic market and found to be directly comparable to the types exported to the Community, it was examined whether domestic sales were sufficiently representative for the purposes of Article 2(2) of the basic Regulation. This was considered to be the case when, during the investigation period, the total domestic sales volume of a type represented 5 % or more of the total sales volume of the same type exported to the Community. For most of the types exported to the Community during the investigation period a comparable representative type sold on the domestic market was found.
(15) For the product types meeting the 5 % test, an examination was then made as to whether the domestic sales of each comparable type could be regarded as having been made in the ordinary course of trade, by establishing the proportion of sales to independent customers of the type in question not made at a loss. In all cases, sales of a type not made at a loss represented more than 80 % of the total domestic sales volume of that type and, therefore, normal value was based on a weighted average price of all domestic sales made during the investigation period.
(16) For the product types exported to the Community where no comparable types sold on the domestic market were found, normal value was constructed on the basis of the costs of manufacturing incurred by the applicant for the exported product types in question plus a reasonable amount for selling, general and administrative costs and profits in accordance with Article 2(3) and 2(6) of the basic Regulation. The general and administrative costs were based on the applicant's domestic sales of the like product. The profit margin was based on the applicant's domestic sales of the like product made in the ordinary course of trade.
Export price
(17) Since all export sales of the product concerned were made directly to independent customers in the Community, the export price was established on the basis of such prices paid or payable, in accordance with Article 2(8) of the basic Regulation.
Comparison
(18) The comparison of normal value with export price was made on an ex-factory basis and at the same level of trade. For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison, account was taken, in accordance with Article 2(10) of the basic Regulation, of differences in factors which were claimed and demonstrated to affect prices and price comparability, i.e. transport costs, insurance costs, handling, loading and ancillary costs, credit costs and commissions.
Dumping margin
(19) The comparison was made between the weighted average adjusted normal value per product type and the weighted average net ex-works export price for the comparable product type, in accordance with Article 2(11) of the basic Regulation.
(20) The comparison as described above did not show the existence of any dumping.
F.   LASTING NATURE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES
(21) In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, it was also examined whether the changed circumstances could reasonably be said to be of a lasting nature.
(22) In this respect, the investigation revealed that the applicant has undergone structural changes affecting considerably the production structure and organisation, resulting in a substantially higher production efficiency that led to a drop in production costs and thus reduced normal value as compared to the investigation period used in the previous investigation (1 April 1999 until 31 March 2000). During the same period, export prices have increased and no reason was found to indicate that this increase was temporary.
(23) It is consequently concluded that the changed circumstances, in particular the increase in export prices to the Community combined with a substantial decrease in production costs, are of a lasting nature.
G.   ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES
(24) In the absence of dumping, it is therefore considered appropriate to repeal the measures insofar as they concern the applicant.
(25) The interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend an amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 and were given an opportunity to comment.
(26) Subsequently, EWRIS submitted some general comments relating mainly to increasing prices of raw materials after the investigation period. EWRIS did not put in question the findings concerning dumping as outlined above, but nevertheless expressed concern about the possibility that the applicant may resume dumping in the future.
(27) Concerning the prices of raw materials, it is noted that the prices of raw materials may have increased after the investigation period, but this could not have been taken into account in the dumping calculation for the applicant. In this case, the main raw material is wire rod, a basic steel product, which is a commodity with prices normally fluctuating within short periods. Therefore, any price increase of such raw material cannot be considered to be of a lasting nature, which could put into question the above findings.
(28) Finally, it should be noted that, since the repeal of the measures concerns only the applicant, and not Turkey as a whole, the applicant remains subject to the proceeding and may be reinvestigated in any subsequent review carried out for Turkey pursuant to Article 11(6) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '15.4.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 97/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 564/2005\nof 8 April 2005\namending Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand and Turkey', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nProduct concerned\n\nLike product\n\nNormal value\n\nExport price\n\nComparison\n\nDumping margin\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1601/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\nIn the table of Article 1(3) the rate of duty (%) for the company Has Çelik ve Halat Sanayi Ticaret A.S.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 18 December 1991  on aid by Germany to the Deggendorf textile works  (Only the German text is authentic)  (92/330/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments in accordance with Article 93,
Whereas:
I
On 25 February 1991, pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the German Permanent Representation notified the Commission of a plan to grant aid to the firm Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH. The firm is mainly active in the production of synthetic  fibres, a sector in which the relevant Community rules require the prior notification of all aid proposals.
The aid was to be financed by the 'Bayerisches regionales Foerderprogramm', approved by the Commission by letter dated 21 December 1988.
Further information regarding the proposed investment are requested from the German authorities by letter dated 14 March 1991. The reply was received by the Commission on 8 May 1991.
By letter dated 27 June 1991 the Commission informed the German Government that it had decided to initiate Article 93 (2) proceedings in respect of the aid and asked the German Government to submit its comments.
Interested third parties were informed of the Commission's decision through publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (1).
The aid relates to investment to be carried out in the firm Pietsch, whose capital was bought by Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH for DM 1 when it was threatened with closure in 1989.
Pietsch, which specializes exclusively in the manufacture of textile curtains, has been subjected by its new owner to a take-over and modernization plan to be supported financially by the Land of Bavaria.
The investment to be aided, amounting to DM 11,95 million, will allow the maintenance of the 134 existing jobs and the creation of 15 new jobs in Pietsch.
The take-over and modernization plan, which was initiated in July 1989 when the firm's assets were taken over, is to extend over three years and to involve the carrying-out of DM 11,95 million in investment, including DM 2 million for real estate  investment and DM 4 million for the purchase of machinery specifically designed for the manufacture of curtains.
Deggendorf is to receive from the Bavarian Ministry for Economic Affairs two soft loans (4,5 % interest) financed under the regional programme of the Land and with a three-year grace period. The first loan, amounting to DM 2,8 million, is to be for 15  years and the second, amounting to DM 3 million, for eight years.
The net grant equivalent of the interest rate subsidy may be put at 3,46 % in the case of the first loan and 2,77 % in the case of the second. The public loans will finance 48,53 % of the investment, to be completed by July 1992.
On the basis of the information available to it, the Commission examined the competition policy impact of the financial and accounting relationship between Deggendorf and Pietsch.
The Commission was not able to determine whether a perfectly clear distinction could be established between the production of synthetic fibres and the new investment. However, it took the view that the aid was liable indirectly to favour Deggendorf,  which manufactures products that may not in principle receive aid under the Community rules applicable to synthetic fibres.
The Commission also took account of the fact that, on 21 May 1986, it took a negative Decision on aid incompatible with the common market that had been granted to Deggendorf between 1981 and 1983. The Decision 86/509/EEC (2) required the repayment of  the DM 6,12 million subsidy and the DM 11 million soft loan which had been granted. These have still not been repaid, and Deggendorf is therefore still the recipient of illegal aid which artificially enhances its competitiveness.
Lastly, the Commission took the view that, on the Community market for polyamide and polyester yarn, which is at the same time highly competitive, with several producers on each of the national markets, and characterized by stagnant demand, highly  capital-intensive investment and reduced profit margins, the aid threatens to distort competition and to affect trade between Member States. Consequently, the aid does not fulfil the conditions that would allow it to qualify for one of the exemptions  provided for in Article 92 (1) to (3) and is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty.
In reaching this view, the Commission carried out an analysis similar to that which it had carried out several months previously when examining aid granted to the same firm Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH for investment to rationalize the production of  stockings and polyamide yarn.
The Commission had concluded that that aid was compatible with the common market, but made its decision subject to the requirement that the German authorities should not actually disburse the aid until the incompatible aid granted illegally from 1981 to  1983 had been repaid.
In its decision to initiate proceedings in respect of the plan to grant restructuring aid to Pietsch (3), the Commission referred to this requirement, stating that 'if this procedure should result in a positive decision authorizing grant of the aid, the  aid should be actually paid only once the illegal aid covered by the Decision of 21 May 1986 has been reimbursed'.
II
The German Government, in submitting its comments under the Article 93 (2) procedure by letter dated 30 July 1991, confirmed and amplified the position taken in the notification, thus providing the Commission with additional information enabling it to  assess - taking account of its effects on competition - the link between Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH, the undisputed recipient of the aid, and Pietsch, the firm in which the aided investment will be carried out.
The German authorities regarded as negligible the effects of the aid on synthetic fibre production in the context of Textilwerke Deggendorf's overall budget.
The Danish and Dutch Governments and the British Textile Confederation sent the Commission brief comments, which were transmitted to the German Government, eliciting no further comments on its part. The German Government presented its reactions to the  Commission's decision by letter of 30 July 1991.
III
The subsidized DM 5,8 million loan granted to Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH under the 'Bayerisches regionales Foerderprogramm' approved by the Commission by letter dated 27 December 1988 constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC  Treaty in that it enables the firm to carry out investment without bearing the full costs.
The aid was properly notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty and with the prior notification requirement provided for in the Community rules applicable to all aid proposals, of whatever form, in favour of companies  in the synthetic fibres sector.
The Commission was thus enabled to formulate its views and assess the proposed aid.
The financial and accounting relationship between Textilwerke Deggendorf and Pietsch appears to the Commission to have no effect on fibre production in the context of the overall budget of the parent company. However, the link increases Textilwerke  Deggendorf's market since Pietsch uses synthetic yarn in the manufacture of its curtains.
In its decision of 26 March 1991 the Commission took the view that an additional market for the production of synthetic yarn helped to reduce the general surplus of supply existing in the sector.
Thus, the link between synthetic yarn and fibre production and the new investment to be financed partly from public funds does not prompt the Commission to assess the planned aid by reference to the unfavourable a priori position contained in the rules  applicable to the synthetic fibres sector.
With specific regard to the firm Pietsch, which manufactures only textile curtains, the Commission notes that the Land of Bavaria intends to support its take-over and modernization plan. The proposed aid is to be granted under a regional aid scheme  approved by the Commission, under the terms provided for by the scheme (aid in the form of an interest rate subsidy on loans, the intensity of the aid being limited to 8 % net grant equivalent). The Commission is in a position to take the view that, by  aiming to maintain the 134 existing jobs in Pietsch and to create 15 additional permanent jobs in Deggendorf's area, the proposed aid facilitates the development of the economic area under consideration and may consequently be considered to be  compatible with the common market pursuant to Article 92 (3) (c).
IV
However, the Commission notes that, until such time as Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH has repaid all the aid which it improperly received from 1981 to 1983, its competitiveness will continue to be enhanced by an advantage that is not without impact on  trading conditions.
Contrary to the comments made by the German authorities after the Commission decided to initiate proceedings, the Commission does not reproach Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH for having appealed to a German court to have an administrative decision relating  to it annulled.
However, the Commission notes on the one hand that the actual recovery of the illegal and incompatible aid has not yet taken place and on the other that it does not have any means of coercion at its disposal to accelerate or enforce the implementation  of its decision of 21 May 1986. In that decision, in which it found that aid granted to the company between 1981 and 1983 was illegal, the Commission requested the repayment of subsidies amounting to DM 6,12 million and soft loans amounting to DM 11  million.
Since that negative Decision was not appealed against before the Court of Justice, it has become final. On the other hand, the German Government appealed to the Court of Justice for annulment of the Commission's decision of 26 March 1991. The Commission  has already pointed out to the German Government in its decision of 26 March 1991 concerning Textilwerke Deggendorf that, in its examination of aid cases, it has to take account of all the circumstances that may influence the impact of the aid on  trading conditions within the Community.
In a recent judgment, the Court of Justice held that, when the Commission examines the compatibility of aid with the common market, it must take account of all the relevant factors, including where appropriate the context already assessed in a previous  decision and the requirements which such previous decision may have imposed on a Member State (4). Accordingly, the Commission may legitimately base a subsequent decision on failure to comply with a condition laid down in a previous decision relating to  the same firm, which is the situation applying in this case.
The antecedents of the case reinforce such an analysis and prompt the Commission to reaffirm on this point the argument put forward in its decision of 26 March 1991; the improper advantage which Textilwerke Deggendorf has enjoyed since 1981/83 has  conferred on the firm an unjustified financial gain which will continue until such time as the illegal and incompatible aid previously received is actually paid back.
Consequently, the Commission is justified in taking the view that the aid in question, which is incompatible with the common market, may not actually be granted to Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH until the firm has repaid the incompatible aid referred to in  its Decision of 21 May 1986.
The aid illegally granted, which Deggendorf has refused to repay since 1986, and the new aid for the investment currently under consideration would have the combined effect of giving the firm an excessive and improper advantage that would adversely  affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
Consequently, even if the aid of DM 744 485 currently planned through the granting of subsidized loans amounting to DM 5,8 million must be considered to be compatible with the common market, the Commission considers that its disbursement should be  suspended pending the repayment of the incompatible aid referred to in its 1986 decision.
This situation has arisen as a result of the negligent behaviour of the German Government and of Deggendorf, who have acted in infringement of the mandatory rules laid down in Article 93 (3). Suspension of the disbursement of the current aid is made all  the more necessary by the fact that the Commission does not have any other means of coercion at its disposal to accelerate or enforce implementation of its 1986 decision.
Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that, in its notice pursuant to Article 93 (2) of the Treaty, the Commission already drew attention to the double distorsion of competition resulting from the non-repayment of the previous incompatible aid by  Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH. Neither the German Government nor the firm have put forward any arguments or remarks that might change the Commission's assessment on this point.
In conclusion, the aid amounting to DM 744 485 which the German Government proposes to grant to Deggendorf is compatible with the common market, but may be granted only when Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH has repaid the aid illegally received between 1981  and 1983 and referred to in Decision 86/509/EEC.
The Commission is obliged to draw this conclusion because Textilwerke Deggendorf has since 1981/83 been improperly benefiting from aid totalling DM 17,12 million and since it still persists in refusing to comply with the requirements incumbent upon it  under Community law by not repaying the relevant aid. It should be stressed that the suspensory condition laid down in this Decision does not conflict with the suspensory clause laid down in the decision of 26 March 1991: firstly, because the desired  effect is the same both cases, namely to prevent Textilwerke Deggendorf, through its attitude, from continuing to benefit from advantages deriving from an unjustified financial gain, and secondly because the present suspensory clause will cease to have  effect as soon as the firm has complied with its repayment obligations as laid down in the decision of 21 May 1986. (The same applies to the suspensory clause laid down in the decision of 26 March 1991),","{'title': '92/330/EEC: Commission Decision of 18 December 1991 on aid by Germany to the Deggendorf textile works (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aid in the form of two subsidized loans of DM 2,8 million and DM 3 million granted to Textilwerke Deggendorf GmbH for 15 years and eight years respectively at 4,5 % interest with a three-year grace period and notified to the Commission by  letter dated 25 February 1991 from the German authorities is compatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe German authorities shall suspend payment to Deggendorf of the aid referred to in Article 1 of this Decision until such time as they have recovered the incompatible aid referred to in Article 1 of Decision 86/509/EEC.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe German Government shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures taken to comply therewith.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(2) lays down the term of validity of export licences.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 67/2004 of 15 January 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 as regards the term of validity of export licences in the milk and milk products sector(3) has limited the validity period of export licences up to 30 April 2004. As the measures required for the management of export refunds in the new situation of the market in milk products that will be created by the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the Community on 1 May 2004 are not yet fully in place, it is necessary to provide for continuity of applications for export licences after 31 March 2004 and to maintain the limit on their validity period. However, in order not to compromise the successful functioning of the new tender system provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products(4), this limitation should not apply to export licences issued in this context.
(3) The potential impact of the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia on 1 May 2004, subject to the entry into force of the Act of Accession of 2003 on the Community milk market and the need to monitor developments in the Community and world markets should be taken into account. It is therefore appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 and to provide that the term of validity of export licences for milk products for which an application has been lodged from 15 April 2004 on should be limited to 30 June 2004.
(4) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 606/2004 of 31 March 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 as regards the term of validity of export licences in the milk and milk products sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), and in particular Article 247 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Decision No 210/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 adopting an action programme for customs in the Community (Customs 2000) (2), the Community transit system has been computerised. The system has been fully operational in the Member States since 1 July 2003 and has been proven to be reliable and satisfactory both for customs administrations and for economic operators.
(2) Under those circumstances it is no longer economically justified to permit formalities to be carried out on the basis of a transit declaration made in writing, the use of which implies that the customs authorities are obliged to enter manually the declaration data into the computerised system. In general, all transit declarations should therefore be lodged using a data-processing technique.
(3) The use of transit declarations made in writing should only be permitted in exceptional cases, where customs’ computerised transit system or the principal’s application are not functioning, in order to allow economic operators to carry out transit operations.
(4) In order to allow travellers to carry out transit operations the customs authorities should authorise the use of transit declarations made in writing where the travellers cannot directly access the computerised transit system.
(5) Since some Member States need to develop and implement necessary tools and links in order to allow all economic operators to be linked to the computerised transit system, a transitional period permitting the use of transit declarations made in writing should be envisaged.
(6) Except in cases where the customs’ computerised transit system or the principal’s application are not functioning, the customs authorities accepting transit declarations made in writing should ensure that the transit data is exchanged between the customs authorities using information technology and computer networks.
(7) In the absence of an opinion delivered by the Customs Code Committee, it is up to the Council to adopt the necessary measures.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n\n((5)) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.\n\n((6)) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n\n((7)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 2006.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 1 December 2006 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n1\n)\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\nex\xa00402\xa010\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\xa0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a)\non exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n—\n—\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n0,00\n0,00\nex\xa00402\xa021\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\xa0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a)\nwhere goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n25,37\n25,37\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n31,00\n31,00\nex\xa00405\xa010\nButter, with a fat content by weight of 82\xa0% (PG 6):\n(a)\nwhere goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n80,00\n80,00\n(b)\non exportation of goods of CN code 2106\xa090\xa098  containing 40\xa0% or more by weight of milk fat\n105,75\n105,75\n(c)\non exportation of other goods\n98,50\n98,50\n(\n1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to Bulgaria, with effect from 1 October 2004, to Romania with effect from 1 December 2005, and to the goods listed in Tables I and II to Protocol No 2 the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation or to the Principality of Liechtenstein with effect from 1 February 2005.'}]}"

The measurement or check shall be carried out by means of a legal measuring instrument suitable for effecting the necessary operations.\n\nThe check may be carried out by sampling.\n\nWhere the actual volume of the contents is not measured, the check carried out by the packer shall be so organized that the nominal volume of the said contents is effectively ensured, in conformity with the provisions of this Directive.\n\nIn order to fulfil this requirement, the packer must carry out production checks in accordance with procedures recognized by the competent departments in the Member State and if he holds at the disposal of these authorities the documents containing the results of such checks, in order to certify that these checks, together with the corrections and adjustments which they have shown to be necessary, have been properly and accurately carried out.\n\nWhere goods are imported from non-EEC countries, the importer may, instead of measuring and checking, provide evidence that he is in possession of all the necessary guarantees enabling him to assume responsibility.\n\nOne of the several methods of meeting the measuring and checking requirement is to use when making up the prepackage a measuring container of the type defined in the Directive relating thereto and filled under the conditions prescribed in this Directive and in that on measuring container bottles.\n\n5.

REQUIREMENTS FOR MEASURING THE ACTUAL CONTENTS OF PREPACKAGES\n\nThe actual contents of prepackages may be measured directly by means of weighing instruments or volumetric instruments or, in the case of liquids, indirectly, by weighing the prepacked product and measuring its density.\n\nIrrespective of the method used, the error made in measuring the actual contents of a prepackage shall not exceed one-fifth of the tolerable negative error for the nominal quantity in the prepackage.\n\nThe procedure for measuring the actual contents of a prepackage may be the subject of domestic regulations in each Member State.\n\n2. REQUIREMENTS FOR CHECKING BATCHES OF PREPACKAGES\n\nThe checking of prepackages shall be carried out by sampling and shall be in two parts:      - a check covering the actual contents of each prepackage in the sample,\n\n- another check on the average of the actual contents of the prepackages in the sample.\n\nA batch of prepackages shall be considered acceptable if the results of both these checks satisfy the acceptance criteria.\n\nFor each of these checks, there are two sampling plans:      - one for non-destructive testing, i.e., testing which does not involve opening the package,\n\n- the other for destructive testing, i.e., testing which involves opening or destroying the package.\n\nFor economic and practical reasons, the latter test shall be limited to the absolutely essential minimum ; it is less effective than the non-destructive test.\n\nDestructive testing shall therefore be used only when non-destructive testing is impracticable. As a general rule it shall not be applied to batches of fewer than 100 units.      2.1. Prepackage batches        2.1.1. The batch shall comprise all the prepackages of the same nominal quantity, the same type and the same production run, packed in the same place, which are to be inspected. The batch size shall be limited to the amounts laid down below.\n\n2.1.2. When prepackages are checked at the end of the packing line, the number in each batch shall be equal to the maximum hourly output of the packing line, without any restriction as to batch size.\n\nIn other cases the batch size shall be limited to 10 000.\n\n2.1.3. For batches of fewer than 100 prepackages, the non-destructive test, where carried out, shall be 100 %.\n\n2.1.4. Before the tests in 2.2 and 2.3 are carried out, a sufficient number of prepackages shall be drawn at random from the batch so that the check requiring the larger sample can be carried out.\n\nFor the other check, the necessary sample shall be drawn at random from the first sample and marked.\n\nThis marking operation shall be completed before the start of measuring operations.\n\n2.2. Checking of the actual contents of a prepackage\n\nThe minimum acceptable contents shall be calculated by subtracting the tolerable negative error for the contents concerned from the nominal quantity of the prepackage.\n\nPrepackages in the batch whose actual contents are less than the minimum acceptable contents shall be considered defective.        2.2.1. Non-destructive testing\n\nNon-destructive testing shall be carried out in accordance with a double sampling plan as shown in the table below:\n\nThe first number of prepackages checked shall be equal to the number of units in the first sample, as indicated in the plan:          - if the number of defective units found in the first sample is less than or equal to the first acceptance criterion, the batch shall be considered acceptable for the purpose of this check,\n\n- if the number of defective units found in the first sample is equal to or greater than the first rejection criterion, the batch shall be rejected,\n\n- if the number of defective units found in the first sample lies between the first acceptance criterion and the first rejection criterion, a second sample shall be checked, the number of units in which is indicated in the plan.\n\nThe defective units found in the first and second samples shall be added together and:          - if the aggregate number of defective units is less than or equal to the second acceptance criterion, the batch shall be considered acceptable for the purpose of this check,\n\n- if the aggregate number of defective units is greater than or equal to the second rejection criterion, the batch shall be rejected. >PIC FILE= ""T0013506"">\n\n2.2.2. Destructive testing\n\nDestructive testing shall be carried out in accordance with the single sampling plan below and shall be used only for batches of 100 or more.\n\nThe number of prepackages checked shall be equal to 20.          - If the number of defective units found in the sample is less than or equal to the acceptance criterion, the batch of prepackages shall be considered as acceptable.\n\n- If the number of defective units found in the sample is equal to or greater than the rejection criterion, the batch of prepackages shall be rejected. >PIC FILE= ""T0013507"">'}]}"

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3700/83 of 22 December 1983 laying down the arrangements applicable to trade with Cyprus beyond 31 December 1983 (1), provides for the opening of a Community tariff quota of 60 000 tonnes of new potatoes, originating in Cyprus and falling within subheading 07.01 A II b) of the Common Customs Tariff, at a rate of customs duty equal to 45 % of the customs duty in the Common Customs Tariff, for the period 16 May to 30 June 1984, whereas it is necessary to open this Community tariff quota for the period in question;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports from Cyprus over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports by each of the Member States represent the following percentages of the imports into the Community from Cyprus of the products concerned:
1.2.3.4 //   //   //   //   // Member States  // 1981  // 1982  // 1983  //   //   //   //   // Benelux  // 4,0  // 4,0  // 6,2  // Denmark  // -  // -  // -  // Germany  // 3,5  // 4,4  // 1,9  // Greece  // -  // -  // -  // France  // -  // -  // -  // Ireland  // 0,1  // -  // 0,2  // Italy  // -  // -  // -  // United Kingdom  // 92,4  // 91,6  // 91,7  //   //   //   //
Whereas, in view of these factors of market forecasts for the products in question and in particular of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:
Benelux 5,0
Denmark 0,1
Germany 4,2
Greece 0,1
France 0,1
Ireland 0,2
Italy 0,1
United Kingdom 90,2
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of the Member States which have used up their initial quota shares; whereas,
in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should under the circumstances be fixed at 94 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional share from the corresponding reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve to prevent a part of any tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;

(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 (3) lays down special rules concerning goods, services and persons crossing the line between the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control and those areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control.
(2) Trade and economic interaction on the island need to be enhanced in the light of experience gained since Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 including the previous amendment entered into force.
(3) To that end, the duties on agricultural products originating in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control should be generally removed. To allow for that, the safeguard clause in Regulation (EC) No 866/2004 needs to be strengthened.
(4) The temporary introduction of goods from the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control into the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control should be regulated, in order to encourage the provision of services by companies established in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control across the line and in order to facilitate participation by those companies in trade fairs or similar events in areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control. Furthermore, goods destined to be repaired in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus exercises effective control should be allowed to cross the line.
(5) Reasonable evidence should be provided that the introduction of such goods is effected on a temporary basis. The customs authorities of the Republic of Cyprus or the authorities of the Eastern Sovereign Base Area may ask for a guarantee to cover any potential customs or fiscal debts if certain temporarily introduced goods are not returned to the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.
(6) In connection with persons crossing the line from the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control into the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which that Government exercises effective control, it should be clarified that their personal effects shall be considered to have been declared for temporary introduction. The same should apply to means of transport.
(7) The total value of goods contained in the personal luggage of persons crossing the line from the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control into the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which that Government exercises effective control needs to be substantially increased so as to encourage economic development in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from the one specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, that amount has to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as, in the present case, long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(2) Belgium submitted to the Commission a request for a derogation under third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC referred to the region of Wallonia.
(3) The requested derogation concerns the intention of Belgium to allow the application in Wallonia of up to 230 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure in specific holdings with more than 48 % of acreage as grassland. The nitrogen application from livestock manure on grassland would not exceed 230 kg per hectare per year, while on arable crops of these farms it would not exceed 115 kg/ha nitrogen per hectare per year.
(4) The designation of nitrates vulnerable zones in respect to Wallonia, in conformity with paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 3 of Directive 91/676/EEC, covers approximately 42 % of this region’s territory and 54 % of utilised agricultural land.
(5) Approximately 500 farms, corresponding to 5,6 % of total number of farms in nitrate vulnerable zones, and 3 % of the Utilised Agricultural Land are estimated to be encompassed by the derogation.
(6) The legislation implementing Directive 91/676/EEC in Wallonia ‘Arrêté du Gouvernement wallon du 15 février 2007 modifiant le Livre II du Code de l’Environnement constituant le Code de l’Eau en ce qui concerne la gestion durable de l’azote en agriculture’ has been adopted and applies equally to the requested derogation.
(7) Water quality data submitted show that in Wallonia in 2005 average nitrate concentration in surface water in nitrate vulnerable zones was 16,7 mg/L, with stable or decreasing trends in 84 % of monitoring sites in the period from 2001 to 2005. Median groundwater concentration in 2005 was 24,8 mg/L nitrates, with stable or decreasing trends in 74 % of monitoring sites in the period from 2001 to 2005.
(8) Average nitrogen input per hectare from livestock manure decreased by 12 % since 1990 and in 2004 was 101 kg/ha of Utilised Agricultural Land, of which 94 % from cattle manure, 3 % from pig manure and 2 % from poultry manure. Average application of chemical fertilisers decreased for both nitrogen and phosphate since 1990, respectively by 19 % and by 49 % and in 2004 was on average of 109 kg/ha and 28 kg/ha respectively for nitrogen and phosphate.
(9) The supporting documents presented in the notification show that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year of nitrogen from manure is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(10) The Commission after examination of the request considers that the proposed amount of 230 kg per hectare per year nitrogen from manure will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.
(11) This Decision should be applicable in connection with the second action programme in force for the region of Wallonia for the period 2007 to 2010.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,","{'header': '6.2.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 32/21', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 20 December 2007\ngranting a derogation requested by Belgium referred to the region of Wallonia pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources\n(notified under document number C(2007) 6643)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(2008/96/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from the one specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, that amount has to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as, in the present case, long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\n\n((2)) Belgium submitted to the Commission a request for a derogation under third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC referred to the region of Wallonia.\n\n((3)) The requested derogation concerns the intention of Belgium to allow the application in Wallonia of up to 230 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure in specific holdings with more than 48\xa0% of acreage as grassland.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, as far as the Treaty is concerned, the authority of the coastal State as regards access by third country vessels to internal waters and ports is exercised by the Member State; whereas, however, as regards access to such ports by fishing vessels  for direct landing and marketing of their catches, it is necessary to enact additional uniform measures at Community level so that such operations are effected in a manner not liable to affect operation of the common fisheries policy, including health  and marketing standards which are applicable to Community production, and so lead to a situation in which competition is distorted to the detriment of Community production and having regard to imports consigned by other means of transport;
Whereas, in particular, landing should be permitted only at ports where health and veterinary checking facilities are available, and masters of the fishing vessels concerned should be required to produce a specific landing statement;
Whereas the access for direct landing by fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, a third country must not impair the market balance sought for certain products by means of the price mechanisms introduced as part of the market organization;  whereas sales of these products must therefore respect price levels set by the Community;
Whereas, moreover, the common organization of the market of these products rests to a large extent on the capacity of producers' organizations to promote price regularization, by imposing on their members compliance with the rules they adopt, in order,  in accordance with the objectives of the Treaty, to ensure in particular that fishermen enjoy a fair standard of living; whereas the advantage linked to the direct landing by the vessels concerned should not lead, in the areas of activities of  producers' organizations, to any jeopardizing of the effectiveness of the measures adopted and implemented by these organizations in the application of the mechanisms of the common organization of the markets; whereas therefore, except where products  are intended for processing, it is necessary to make the marketing of catches by fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, a third country subject to such measures;
Whereas the application of this Regulation will require adequate provision of information at ports where direct landing and marketing by vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, a third country are permitted;
Whereas after a certain time it will be necessary to examine the results of the application of this Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1093/94 of 6 May 1994 setting the terms under which fishing vessels of a third country may land directly and market their catches at Community ports', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nOn the terms set out in this Regulation, fishing vessels flying the flag of, or registered in, a third country are authorized to land their fishery products directly at ports of Community Member States, for release for free circulation and  marketing.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n1. fishery products: all products brought directly from the catch location, possibly after transhipment at sea from another vessel, and covered by Chapter 3 of Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical  nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (4);\n\n2. fishing vessel:\n\n- a vessel, whatever its dimensions, used primarily or secondarily to take fishery products;\n\n- a vessel that, even if not itself used to make catches by its own means, takes the fishery products referred to in Article 1 by transhipment from other vessels;\n\n- a vessel aboard which fishery products referred to in Article 1 are subject to one or more of the following operations prior to packaging: filleting or slicing, skinning, mincing, freezing and/or processing.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\n1.

DIRECTIVE 2005/89/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 18 January 2006
concerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (3), has made a very important contribution towards the creation of the internal market for electricity. The guarantee of a high level of security of electricity supply is a key objective for the successful operation of the internal market and that Directive gives the Member States the possibility of imposing public service obligations on electricity undertakings, inter alia, in relation to security of supply. Those public service obligations should be defined as precisely and strictly as possible, and should not result in the creation of generation capacity that goes beyond what is necessary to prevent undue interruption of distribution of electricity to final customers.
(2) Demand for electricity is usually forecast over a medium-term period on the basis of scenarios elaborated by transmission system operators or by other organisations capable of constructing them at the request of a Member State.
(3) A competitive single EU electricity market necessitates transparent and non-discriminatory policies on security of electricity supply compatible with the requirements of such a market. The absence of such policies in individual Member States, or significant differences between the policies of the Member States would lead to distortions of competition. The definition of clear roles and responsibilities of the competent authorities, as well as of Member States themselves and all relevant market actors, is therefore crucial in safeguarding security of electricity supply and the proper functioning of the internal market while at the same time avoiding creating obstacles to market entrants, such as companies generating or supplying electricity in a Member State that have recently started their operations in that Member State, and avoiding creating distortions of the internal market for electricity or significant difficulties for market actors, including companies with small market shares, such as generators or suppliers with a very small share in the relevant Community market.
(4) Decision No 1229/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), sets out a series of guidelines for Community policy on trans-European energy networks. Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (5) sets out, inter alia, the general principles and detailed rules relating to congestion management.
(5) When promoting electricity from renewable energy sources, it is necessary to ensure the availability of associated back-up capacity, where technically necessary, in order to maintain the reliability and security of the network.
(6) In order to meet the Community’s environmental commitments and to reduce its dependence on imported energy, it is important to take account of the long-term effects of growth of electricity demand.
(7) Cooperation between national transmission system operators in issues relating to network security including definition of transfer capacity, information provision and network modelling is vital to the development of a well-functioning internal market and could be further improved. A lack of coordination regarding network security is detrimental to the development of equal conditions for competition.
(8) The main intention of the relevant technical rules and recommendations, such as those contained in the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE) Operation handbook, similar rules and recommendations developed by Nordel, the Baltic Grid Code and those for the United Kingdom and Irish systems, is to provide support for the technical operation of the interconnected network, thus contributing to meeting the need for continued operation of the network in the event of system failure at an individual point or points in the network and minimising the costs related to mitigating such supply disruption.
(9) Transmission and distribution system operators should be required to deliver a high level of service to final customers in terms of the frequency and duration of interruptions.
(10) Measures which may be used to ensure that appropriate levels of generation reserve capacity are maintained should be market-based and non-discriminatory and could include measures such as contractual guarantees and arrangements, capacity options or capacity obligations. These measures could also be supplemented by other non-discriminatory instruments such as capacity payments.
(11) In order to ensure that appropriate prior information is available, Member States should publish measures taken to maintain the balance between supply and demand among actual and potential investors in generation and among electricity consumers.
(12) Without prejudice to Articles 86, 87 and 88 of the Treaty, it is important for Member States to lay down an unambiguous, appropriate and stable framework which will facilitate security of electricity supply and is conducive to investments in generation capacity and demand management techniques. It is also important that appropriate measures are taken to ensure a regulatory framework that encourages investment in new transmission interconnection, especially between Member States.
(13) The European Council in Barcelona on 15 and 16 March 2002 agreed on a level of interconnection between Member States. Low levels of interconnection have the effect of fragmenting the market and are an obstacle to the development of competition. The existence of adequate physical transmission interconnection capacity, whether cross-border or not, is crucial but it is not a sufficient condition for competition to be fully effective. In the interest of final customers, the relation between the potential benefits of new interconnection projects and the costs for such projects should be reasonably balanced.
(14) While it is important to determine the maximum available transfer capacities without breaching the requirements of secure network operation, it is also important to ensure full transparency of the capacity calculation and allocation procedure in the transmission system. In this way, it could be possible to make better use of existing capacity, and no false shortage signals will be given to the market, which will support the achievement of a fully competitive internal market as envisaged in Directive 2003/54/EC.
(15) Transmission and distribution system operators need an appropriate and stable regulatory framework for investment, and for maintenance and renewal of the networks.
(16) Article 4 of Directive 2003/54/EC requires Member States to monitor and submit a report on security of electricity supply. This report should cover short, medium and long-term factors relevant for security of supply including transmission system operators’ intention to invest in the network. In compiling such a report, Member States will be expected to refer to information and assessments already being undertaken by transmission system operators both on an individual and collective basis, including at European level.
(17) Member States should ensure the effective implementation of this Directive.
(18) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely secure electricity supplies based on fair competition and the creation of a fully operational internal electricity market, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,","{'header': '4.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 33/22', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2005/89/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 18\xa0January 2006\nconcerning measures to safeguard security of electricity supply and\xa0infrastructure investment\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\xa0June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity(3), has made a very important contribution towards the creation of the internal market for electricity.
