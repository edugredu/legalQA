THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped  or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community  (1), and in  particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory  Committee,
Whereas:
A.  PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1)  By Regulation (EEC) No 830/92  (2), the Council imposed a definitive  anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyester yarns falling within CN codes 5509  21  10, 5509   21  90, 5509  22  10, 5509  22  90, 5509  51  00 and 5509  53  00, and originating in Indonesia and  several other countries, with the exception of goods produced and sold for export to the Community  by one Indonesian producer for which the anti-dumping duty does not apply.
B.  REVIEW
(2)  Six Indonesian companies, PT Bitratex Industrial Corp., PT Elegant Textile  Industry, PT Gokak Indonesia, PT Indorama Synthetics, PT Lotus Indah Textile Industries, PT Sunrise  Bumi Textiles claimed that their export ex-works price was higher than their domestic ex-works  price, that their domestic selling prices were profitable, and that in consequence they were no  longer dumping.
(3)  Two other Indonesian companies, PT Kanindo Success Textile Industries and PT Sulindafin Permai  Spinning Mills (PT Sulindamills) claimed that they did not export the products concerned during the  period covered by the previous investigation and only started doing so after that period and that  they were not related to any company subject to the previous investigation. Therefore, they  requested that a newcomer review be opened.
(4)  Those companies provided evidence of the facts they alleged, which was considered sufficient  to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 14 of Regulation  (EEC) No 2423/88. By a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3),  the Commission, after consultation within the Advisory Committee, initiated a review of Regulation  (EEC) No 830/92 with regard to the eight companies cited above and commenced its investigation. The  review was limited to an examination of changed circumstances in dumping.
It should be noted that the exports of these companies represent 35  % of total exports of mixed  yarn to the European Community by Indonesian exporters.
(5)  The Commission sent questionnaires to the parties concerned and gave them the opportunity to  make their views known. The Commission sought and verified all information it considered necessary  and inspected the information submitted in the premises of all the companies abovementioned. The  Commission also received information from the complainant in the original investigation.
(6)  The investigation covered the period 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1993 (investigation  period).
C.  RESULT OF INVESTIGATION
1.  Normal value (7)  Domestic sales of the producers under consideration were used where they exceeded 5  % of  sales of the type concerned, therefore represented a volume sufficient to constitute a  representative market and an adequate basis for calculating the normal value. Normal value was  therefore calculated, by type, on the basis of the weighted average domestic prices in the domestic  market at prices actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade, in accordance with  Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
The prices were net of all discounts and rebates directly linked to the sales under consideration.
(8)  Constructed value was used where domestic prices did not permit recovery of all costs in the  normal course of trade, or where the sales in the Indonesian market of the similar type did not  exist. In accordance with Article 2  (3)  (b)  (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the normal  value was determined, by type, by adding costs, both fixed and variable, of raw materials and  manufacture, plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses and a  reasonable profit margin.
The profit margin used was based on the weighted average profit realized by the producer on all  profitable sales of the same type of the like product or when there were no sales of the same type,  it was based on the profitable sales of the like product of the Indonesian producer concerned.
2.  Export price (9)  Where sales were made to independent importers in the Community, export price was determined  on the basis of the price actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the  Community, in accordance with Article 2  (8)  (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
As far as the two newcomers are concerned, the investigation showed that they had exported the  product concerned to the Community during the investigation period. Therefore the Commission was  able to calculate the dumping.
3.  Comparison (10)  For the purpose of ensuring a fair comparison between normal value and export price, account  was taken of differences directly affecting price comparability, such as commissions, credit terms,  transport, insurance, handling, packing and technical assistance, in accordance with Article 2   (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
Export prices were compared, on a transaction by transaction basis, with normal value at ex-works  level.
(11)  The Indonesian producers claimed an adjustment for the salaries paid to salesmen. However,  the investigation showed that the so-called salesmen were all employed at management level as shown  by their position in the organigram of the companies and the corresponding salaries. Therefore, it  was considered that these companies failed to prove that this personnel was wholly engaged in  direct selling activities. In these circumstances, the adjustment was not granted.
(12)  The Indonesian producers also claimed that normal value should be reduced by an allowance  corresponding to import charges borne by materials physically incorporated in the like product when  destined for domestic consumption and refunded when exported to the Community. After examining the  evidence submitted by the claimants in this context, the adjustment was duly allowed pursuant to  Article 2  (10)  (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
4.  Dumping margin (13)  The examination of the facts showed the existence of dumping with respect to the product  concerned. The margins of dumping, being equal to the amount by which normal value exceded the  price for export to the Community, expressed as a percentage of the net, free-at-Community-frontier  price, customs duty unpaid, were as follows:
>TABLE>
Except for PT Kanindo Success Textile Industries and PT Lotus Indah Textile Industries for which no  dumping was found, the dumping margins of the other companies are to be considered as de minimis.
(14)  As far as PT Gokak Indonesia is concerned, it was found that this company did not export the  product under consideration to the Community during the investigation period. Therefore, as no new  calculation concerning the dumping margin could be made, it was proposed by the company that either  a variable duty be imposed on the basis of the minimum export prices, or the weighted average  dumping margin found for the other companies involved in the review be used.
The on-the-spot investigation showed that all its domestic sales were made at a loss and there was  every indication that its exports to third countries were dumped.
In the light of the above the Commission services have considered that, for this company, the  conditions under which the duty would be withdrawn were not fulfilled, contrary to the other  companies involved in the review.
In these circumstances, taking into consideration the fact that the large variety of types of yarns  concerned makes it impossible to impose a minimum price based on the constructed normal value, it  is proposed to maintain the anti-dumping duty imposed in the original investigation, i.e. 11,9  %,  bearing in mind that this company exported the product concerned to third countries at dumped  prices and that there is nothing to suggest that it might behave differently regarding exports to  the Community.
D.  INJURY AND COMMUNITY INTEREST
(15)  No request for review of the findings on injury and  Community interest was made and there is no reason to doubt the validity of the injury findings in  the original investigation.
E.  AMENDMENT OF THE REVIEWED MEASURES
(16)  In the present case, since, for seven Indonesian  producers, there is either no dumping, or the dumping margins found are de minimus, the Commission  considers that Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 should be amended and that the anti-dumping duty be  withdrawn for these companies.
(17)  The duty of 11,9  % imposed in the original investigation is to be maintained for PT Gokak  Indonesia.
(18)  The companies concerned and the complainant in the original investigation have been informed  of these findings.
(19)  In accordance with Article 15  (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the duration of validity  of the measures imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 is not affected by this Regulation which  neither modifies nor confirms these measures,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1168/95 of 22 May 1995 amending Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyester yarns (man-made staple fibres) with regard to those originating in Indonesia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1  (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 shall be replaced by the  following:', 'text': ""Article 1  (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 830/92 shall be replaced by the  following:\n\n'3.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 3, 9 and 9d(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for the authorisation of the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Hansenula polymorpha (DSM 15087) for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening, laying hens, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows. On 7 March 2006 the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) delivered its opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category targeted or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.
(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1411/1999 (3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex I to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.
(7) The use of the coccidiostat preparation of semduramicin sodium (AVIAX 5 %) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1041/2002 (4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for 10 years of that coccidiostat. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance, as specified in the Annex II, should be authorised for 10 years.
(8) Data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, belonging to the group ‘Vitamins, provitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect’ for chickens for fattening, laying hens and turkeys. On 26 May 2005 the Authority has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for the consumer, the user, the animal category targeted or the environment. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that vitamin preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be authorised without time limit.
(9) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 of 29 October 1992 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 267/96(4), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 7(1) thereof,
(1) Whereas, by Decision 98/657/EC(5), the Commission adopted a plan allocating resources to the Member States for the 1999 financial year; whereas that plan specifies the financial resources available for its implementation in 1999 in the participating Member States and lays down the quantities of each type of product to be withdrawn from intervention stocks within the limit of those financial resources; whereas the plan should be adopted to take account, on the one hand, of the correction to the intervention price used for determining the quantities of olive oil made available to the Member States requesting that product and, on the other hand, of the available budget resources allocated for the operation; whereas account should also be taken of underconsumption observed when the annual plan was implemented so that appropriations not utilised can be allocated to those Member States wishing to use them; whereas, with a view to the utilisation of those quantities of products, intra-Community transfers should also be authorised in accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1) and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first paragraph of point 1 of Article 8 and point 4 of Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (2), and in particular Articles 23(1) and 24(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2007/777/EC of 29 November 2007 laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of certain meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decision 2005/432/EC (3) lays down rules on imports into the Union and the transit and storage in the Union of consignments of meat products, and of consignments of treated stomachs, bladders and intestines, as defined in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (4).
(2) Decision 2007/777/EC also lays down lists of third countries and parts thereof from which such imports and transit and storage are to be authorised, sets out the model public and animal health certificates, and the rules on the origin and treatments required for those imported products.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (5) lays down veterinary certification requirements for imports into and transit, including storage during transit, through the Union of poultry, hatching eggs, day-old chicks, specified pathogen-free eggs, meat, minced meat and mechanically separated meat of poultry, including ratites and wild game birds, eggs and egg products. That Regulation provides that those commodities are only to be imported into the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in Part 1 of Annex I thereto.
(4) Due to recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in South Africa, Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 were amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 536/2011 (6), in order to prescribe specific treatments for imports from South Africa of meat products, treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption obtained from meat of farmed ratites and of biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products consisting of, or containing meat of farmed feathered game, ratites and wild game birds which are sufficient to eliminate animal health risks linked to these commodities and to prohibit imports of breeding and productive ratites and of day-old chicks, hatching eggs and meat of ratites. from the whole territory of South Africa covered by Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.
(5) South Africa has submitted information to the Commission on the control measures taken in relation to the recent HPAI outbreaks. The Commission has evaluated that information and the epidemiological situation following those outbreaks in South Africa.
(6) In addition, the Union’s Veterinary Emergency Team carried out a mission to South Africa to assess the situation and give recommendations to improve disease control.
(7) South Africa has implemented a stamping-out policy in order to control the disease and limit its spread. South Africa is carrying out surveillance activities for avian influenza which appear to meet the requirements laid down in Part II of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008.
(8) The positive outcome of the evaluation of the disease situation and the epidemiological investigations carried out by South Africa allow limiting the restrictions on imports of ratite meat into the Union to the disease-affected part of the territory of South Africa, placed under restrictions by South Africa. However, the restrictions on imports of live ratites and their hatching eggs should be maintained for the whole territory of South Africa owing to the higher risk for a possible virus introduction into the Union.
(9) With respect to the treatments laid down in Decision 2007/777/EC for imports of certain meat products, treated stomachs, bladders and intestines for human consumption as well as for biltong/jerky and pasteurised meat products, the treatments applied before the occurrence of the HPAI outbreaks should again be applied for those commodities originating from the disease-free part of the territory of South Africa.
(10) Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC lists the territories or parts of territories of third countries to which regionalisation for animal health reasons applies. South Africa’s entry should be amended to take account of the new disease situation as regards HPAI in that third country and the resulting consequences for the restrictions on imports of affected commodities into the Union.
(11) Decision 2007/777/EC and Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular Articles 26 and 33 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under the arrangements for the private storage of wine and musts provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, producers should be allowed to conclude sales contracts during the period of validity of storage contracts in order to encourage them to become more market oriented.
(2) Article 42 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 (2), provides for the approval of distillers of wine and the drawing up of lists of approved distillers. Given the importance of the distillation of potable alcohol, distillers should be guaranteed access to those lists. In addition, given advances in communications technologies, the electronic publication of this information should be provided for.
(3) As regards the arrangements for the distillation or the withdrawal under supervision of by-products of wine-making, the rules on the organic production of grapes should be clarified and the notification to the Commission of certain derogations granted by the Member States should be provided for.
(4) Article 63a of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000, concerning the distillation of wine into potable alcohol, lays down a percentage of producers’ production that may be distilled. The percentage for the 2004/05 wine year should be set. In addition, experience in previous wine years indicates that some of the dates for this distillation should be amended. In order better to monitor the movement of the alcohol obtained in these distillation operations, prior authorisation should be provided for.
(5) In order to guarantee the smooth implementation of intervention measures where several Member States are involved, the Commission should be notified of the competent authorities designated by the Member States.

Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 15 (1) of the abovementioned Directive, seed or propagating material of these varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially approved in at least one of the Member States and which also fulfil the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, after the expiry of a given period, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety within the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of the abovementioned Directive provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas, with the abovementioned Decisions, the Commission has authorized the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to prohibit the marketing of seed of durum wheat and also of certain types of varieties of oats (winter oats) and of maize (late varieties) because it was well known that the varieties of these species or types have not yet been suitable for cultivation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of the abovementioned Directive);
Whereas, meanwhile, varieties of winter oats have been under test in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for a possible cultivation of this species in that country;
Whereas because of the results of this possible cultivation it can no longer be maintained that varieties of this species are not suitable for cultivation in any part of the territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg;
Whereas, therefore, the conditions of Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of the abovementioned Directive are no longer satisfied in the case of varieties of winter oats;
Whereas for the species durum wheat and maize the user information system in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has been set up in such a way as to permit the Grand Duchy to give up its prohibitions on marketing;

BECKETT\n\n(1) OJ L 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1.\n\nANNEX\n\nESTONIA\n\n1. Objectives\n\nThe purpose of the accession partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's opinion on Estonia's application for membership of the European Union, the financial means available to help Estonia implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The accession partnership will provide a framework for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate countries in their preparations for membership. These will include inter alia the national programme for the adoption of the acquis to be adopted by Estonia, the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, the pact against organised crime and the internal market road maps. Each of these instruments is different in nature and will be prepared and implemented according to specific procedures. They will not be an integral part of this partnership but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it.\n\n2. Principles\n\nThe main priority areas identified for each candidate country relate to their ability to assume the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires:\n\n- that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities,\n\n- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union,\n\n- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.\n\nAt its meeting in Madrid, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate countries to adjust their administrative structures to ensure the harmonious operation of Community policies after accession and at Luxembourg, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.\n\n3. Priorities and intermediate objectives\n\nThe Commission's opinions and the Council's examination of these have highlighted the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate countries to prepare for accession and took the view that none of these countries fully satisfies all of the Copenhagen criteria at the present time. This situation will require the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the countries concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. The priorities and intermediate objectives have been divided into two groups - short- and medium-term. Those listed under the short-term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Estonia can complete or take them substantially forward by the end of 1998. In view of the short time span, and taking into account the administrative capacity required to achieve them, the number of priorities selected for the short-term has been limited. The priorities listed under the medium-term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work may and should also begin on them during 1998.\n\nEstonia will be invited to draw up a national programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA) by the end of March which should set out a timetable for achieving these priorities and intermediate objectives and, where possible and relevant, indicate the necessary staff and financial resources.\n\nThe accession partnership will indicate that Estonia will have to address all issues identified in the opinion. Incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis.\n\nDrawing on the analysis of the Commission's opinion and the Council's examination of this, the following short- and medium-term priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Estonia.\n\n3.1. Short-term (1998)\n\nPolitical criteria: take measures to facilitate the naturalisation process and to better integrate non-citizens including Stateless children. Enhance Estonian language training for non-Estonian speakers.\n\nEconomic reform: establishment of medium-term economic policy priorities and joint assessment within the framework of the Europe Agreement; in particular with a view to sustaining the high growth rates of recent years, while reducing inflation and increasing the level of national savings; acceleration of land reform with a view to increase private ownership and introduction of key legislation linked to pension reform.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: in particular as regards regulatory and monitoring bodies and the development of a comprehensive national training strategy for civil servants and developing a strategy and timetable for the consolidation of the various supervisory agencies in the financial sector, strengthen internal financial control, reinforcement of phytosanitary and veterinary administrations, particulary as regards facilities at external borders, institutional strengthening in the area of environment, begin to set up structures needed for regional and structural policy.\n\nInternal market: including further alignment in the areas of public procurement, intellectual and industrial property, financial services, taxation, technical legislation and competition (especially the transparency of State aid). Adoption of new competition law, covering both anti-trust and State aid, reinforcement of the State aid monitoring authority and the establishment of a first State aid inventory.\n\nJustice and home affairs: in particular further efforts to implement measures to combat corruption and organised crime and continue judicial reform.\n\nEnvironment: continue transposition of framework legislation, establishment of detailed approximation programmes and implementation strategies related to individual acts. Planning and commencement of implementation of these programmes and strategies.\n\n3.2. Medium-term\n\nPolitical criteria: pursue integration of non-citizens by strengthening Estonian language training for Russian-speakers in primary and secondary schools as well as adult training courses, and by further measures to accelerate the naturalisation process.\n\nEconomic policy: regular review of the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, within the Europe Agreement framework, focusing on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria for membership of the Union and the acquis in the area of economic and monetary policy (coordination of economic policies, submission of convergence programmes, avoidance of excessive deficits); while Estonia is not expected to adopt the euro immediately on accession, it is expected to pursue policies which aim to achieve real convergence in accordance with the Union's objectives of economic and social cohesion, and nominal convergence compatible with the ultimate goal of adoption of the euro.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: at central and local level to ensure efficient management of the public sector; special attention should be paid to the budgetary process, internal financial control, statistics, environment and agriculture; improved operation of the judicial system; training for the judiciary in Community law and its application, reinforcement of justice and home affairs institutions (ensuring sufficient and properly trained personnel, in particular police, border guards, ministries and courts), reform of customs and tax administrations to ensure readiness to apply the acquis, the reinforcement of food control administration.\n\nInternal market: including alignment, in particular in public procurement, financial services (banking and insurance rules), intellectual and industrial property and, State aid, data protection, strengthening of securities regulatory bodies, audiovisual and indirect taxation. Upgrading of standardisation and conformity assessment structures, alignment of technical legislation on industrial products and establishment of a market surveillance system. Completion of alignment and effective implementation of competition law and the reinforcement of the competition authorities, promotion of enterprise development, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alignment with the acquis in the fields of telecommunications, consumer protection and the internal energy market.\n\nJustice and home affairs: ratification and application of necessary international legal instruments relevant for the acquis, enhanced border management especially on the eastern border, implementation of migration policy and asylum procedures, alignment of visa policy with that of the Union and completion of alignment on international conventions, enhanced fight against organised crime (in particular money laundering, drugs and trafficking in human beings), notably in view of the Schengen acquis.\n\nAgriculture: including alignment with the agricultural acquis (including veterinary and phytosanitary matters, in particular external border controls), attention to environmental aspects of agriculture and biodiversity, completion of the land restitution and land registration process. Development of the capacity to implement and enforce the common agricultural policy (CAP), in particular the fundamental management mechanisms and administrative structures to monitor the agricultural markets and implement structural and rural development measures, adoption and implementation of the veterinary and phytosanitary requirements, upgrading of certain food processing establishments and testing and diagnostic facilities, restructuring of the agri-food sector.\n\nFisheries: development of capacity to implement and enforce the common fisheries policy.\n\nTransport: further efforts on alignment with the acquis in particular on road transport (market access, safety rules) and maritime transport (safety) and rail transport, and to provide necessary investment for transport infrastructure, notably extension of trans-European networks.\n\nEmployment and social affairs: development of appropriate labour-market structures and joint review of employment policies as preparation for participation in Union coordination; alignment of labour and occupational health and safety legislation and development of enforcement structures in particular early adoption of the framework directive on health and safety at work; enforcement of equal opportunities between women and men; further development of active, autonomous social dialogue; further development of social protection, undertake steps to bring public health standards into line with Union norms.\n\nEnvironment: including the development of monitoring and implementation control structures and capacities, continuous planning and implementation of approximation programmes related to individual legal acts. A particular emphasis should be given to air pollution, the water, and waste sector, including radioactive waste. Environmental protection requirements and the need for sustainable development must be integrated into the definition and implementation of national, sectoral policies.\n\nRegional policy and cohesion: further develop the legal administrative and budgetary framework for a national policy to address regional disparities through an integrated approach, in order to participate in Union structural programmes after membership.\n\n4. Programming\n\nThe PHARE allocation for the period 1995 to 1997 has totalled ECU 90 million. Subject to the approval of the PHARE budget for the remaining period, the Commission will confirm the allocations for 1998 and 1999. Financial proposals will be submitted to the PHARE Management Committee as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89. Joint financing by the applicant countries will be systematically required for all investment projects. Financial assistance from the year 2000 onwards will comprise aid for agriculture and a structural instrument which will give priority to measures similar to the Cohesion Fund.\n\n5. Conditionality\n\nCommunity assistance will be conditional on respect by Estonia of its commitments under the Europe Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and progress in implementing this accession partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.\n\n6. Monitoring\n\nThe implementation of the accession partnership will be monitored in the framework of the Europe Agreement. This will begin in 1998 before the Commission presents its first regular report to the Council reviewing the progress made by Estonia including implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe relevant sections of the accession partnership will be discussed in the appropriate sub-committee. The Association Committee will discuss overall developments, progress and problems in meeting its priorities and intermediate objectives as well as more specific issues referred to it from the sub-committees. The Association Committee will report to the Association Council on the implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe PHARE Management Committee will ensure that financing decisions are compatible with the accession partnerships.\n\nThe accession partnership will be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98. The Commission will propose, before the end of 1999 and at regular intervals thereafter, a review of this partnership, on which the Council will take a formal decision. These reviews will include consideration of the need to further specify intermediate objectives in the light of the progress made by Estonia in meeting the objectives set out in this partnership.""}]}"

ANNEX   NON-EXHAUSTIVE INFORMATION REGARDING THE DEFINITION, SELECTION, PRESENTATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PILOT PROJECTS AND INNOVATORY MEASURES  III. DEFINITION\n\ni(i) Pilot projects\n\n1. A pilot project must constitute a coherent programme of assistance for the economically and socially less privileged and not simply be a collection of unconnected, heterogeneous projects.\n\n2. Pilot projects must be implemented in locations defined in terms of their characteristics and size (district, town, region).\n\nThe location selected must lend itself to action in depth, and in particular must enable all interested parties to work together.\n\n3. Pilot projects must relate to several aspects of the situation of the economically and socially less privileged, e.g. income, housing, health, education, social protection, employment, training, culture.\n\nThe choice of aspects must be such as to ensure that the pilot project forms a consistent whole.\n\n4. Pilot projects must involve the population of the selected area in a spirit of participation.\n\nPilot projects must have the support of private participants (e.g. employers) or associations (e.g. trade unions, local groups, local development associations) and of the public authorities (local, regional and/or national, as appropriate).\n\n5. Pilot projects must be sufficiently representative to provide information of general interest regarding the economically and socially less privileged and to allow of subsequent transfer to other entities or expansion.\n\n6. Pilot project must be aimed primarily at those who are economically and socially most disadvantaged.\n\n(ii) Innovatory measures\n\n1. Innovatory measures must demonstrate cases in which specific action is required to assist the most disadvantaged.\n\n2. Innovatory measures may take the form of new responses to certain specific situations.\n\n3. Whether a measure is in fact innovatory must be determined by reference to what is being done in the Community as a whole.\n\nIII. SELECTION\n\nWhen pilot projects and innovatory measures are selected, account will be taken of the extent to which pilot projects or innovatory measures:\n\n1. are carried out by participants with particular qualifications and/or experience;\n\n2. effectively assist the group of people they cover;\n\n3. encourage the independence and self-confidence of the persons concerned, including measures to promote self-sufficiency;\n\n4. help the employment situation (e.g. promotion of self-employment, improvement of vocational skills);\n\n5. channel aid to the most disadvantaged;\n\n6. concentrate on socially and economically disadvantaged areas.\n\nIII. PRESENTATION\n\nApplications for Community aid must:\n\n1. state precisely\n\n- the aim of the pilot project or innovatory measure,\n\n- the group of people covered,\n\n- the location chosen and type of area,\n\n- the number and type of participants and authorities involved;\n\n2. describe what the pilot project or innovatory measure is expected to achieve and estimate the probable cost;\n\n3. be designed in such a way that the results to be achieved may be compared.\n\nIV. ASSESSMENT\n\nEach pilot project and innovatory measure should be assessed continuously and at the end of the programme.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The following active substances have been included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC: pyrimethanil, pethoxamid, bifenazate and rimsulfuron by Commission Directives 2006/74/EC (4), 2006/41/EC (5), 2005/58/EC (6), and 2006/39/EC (7) respectively.
(2) The inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned was based on the assessment of the information submitted concerning the proposed use. Information relating to that use has been submitted by certain Member States in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of that Directive. The information available has been reviewed and is sufficient to allow certain maximum residue levels (MRLs) to be fixed.
(3) Where no Community MRL or provisional MRL exists, Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised.
(4) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number of Codex MRLs for bifenazate. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs have been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers. No risk was established when using the toxicological end points based on the studies available to the Commission.
(5) The Commission review reports which were prepared for the inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances concerned, fixed the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) and, if necessary, the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for those substances. The exposure of consumers of food products treated with the active substance concerned has been assessed in accordance with Community procedures. Account has also been taken of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (8) and the opinion of the Scientific Committee for Plants (9) on the methodology employed. It is concluded that MRLs proposed will not lead to those ADIs or ARfD being exceeded.
(6) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, provisional MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(7) The setting at Community level of such provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI to that Directive. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRLs should then become definitive.
(8) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC, to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(9) Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

The provisional MRLs should then become definitive.\n\n((8)) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC, to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.\n\n((9)) Directives 86/362/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex II to Directive 86/362/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nAnnex II to Directive 90/642/EEC is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Directive.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nMember States shall adopt and publish, by 5 April 2008 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes flurprimidol.
(3) For flurprimidol the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For flurprimidol the rapporteur Member State was Finland and all relevant information was submitted on 20 April 2007.
(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group Evaluation and presented to the Commission on 31 July 2008 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance flurprimidol (4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 26 September 2008 in the format of the Commission review report for flurprimidol.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. In particular, based on the available information, the operator and worker exposure exceed the AOEL (acceptable operator exposure level) in all evaluated scenarios and conditions of use. Moreover, no data was available on the impurity profile of batches used in toxicological studies. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that flurprimidol met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing flurprimidol satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Flurprimidol should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing flurprimidol are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing flurprimidol should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing flurprimidol remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for flurprimidol according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the detailed implementation rules of which have been laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (5), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.

Whereas, when the guide price for soya beans is fixed on an annual basis, account should be taken of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution which the Community desires to make to the harmonious development of world  trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are, in particular, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and to ensure that supplies are available and reach consumers at reasonable prices;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1491/85 provides more specifically that this price shall be fixed at a fair level for producers, having regard to the supply requirements of the Community; whereas, to this end, a  balanced relationship should be maintained between this price and the price of other oil seeds;

on a derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as regards the rules of origin under the scheme of generalised tariff preferences in respect of bicycles produced in Cambodia regarding the use under cumulation of bicycle parts originating in Malaysia
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (1), and in particular Article 247 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (2), and in particular Article 89(1)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 1 January 2014, the Union granted generalised tariff preferences to Cambodia.
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 (4) establishes the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purpose of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (‘GSP’). That Regulation provides for the possibility to grant, in certain precisely defined circumstances, derogations from that definition in favour of GSP beneficiary countries. The regional cumulation provisions under Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 were amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 530/2013, which clarified that regional cumulation can only apply in the same regional group to countries which, at the time of exportation to the Union, are beneficiaries of the GSP. These amendments by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 530/2013 apply from 1 January 2014.
(3) On 15 May 2013, Cambodia submitted a request for a transition period according to which the Cambodian bicycle industry would continue to be entitled, for the purpose of determining the origin of bicycles of HS heading 8712 Cambodia exports to the Union, to consider parts originating in Malaysia and Singapore as materials originating in Cambodia by virtue of regional cumulation under the GSP scheme as of 1 January 2014, the date the amended regional cumulation provisions apply.
(4) Cambodia has a growing bicycle industry, but the industry remains weak and has been relying heavily on the supply of parts originating in neighbouring countries that used to be GSP beneficiary countries and belonged to the same regional cumulation group, in particular Singapore and Malaysia.
(5) By letter of 9 August 2013 the Commission requested Cambodia to submit further information. On 26 September 2013 Cambodia transmitted its answer to that request, as a result of which its application was considered as complete.
(6) As of 1 January 2014, Singapore is no longer a GSP eligible nor GSP beneficiary country and thus the possibility of cumulation with the other countries of the regional cumulation Group I ceases to exist. As of 1 January 2014, Malaysia is no longer a GSP beneficiary country but remains on the list of GSP eligible countries.
(7) As a consequence, from 1 January 2014, bicycle parts originating in Singapore and Malaysia cannot be considered as originating in Cambodia under regional cumulation, which prevents Cambodia from meeting the rule of origin applicable to least-developed countries for this product (HS heading 8712). Indeed, even though that rule allows for the use of up to 70 % of non-originating materials, the share of non-originating materials in certain bicycles assembled in Cambodia would exceed that limit.
(8) Cambodia has presented in its submission to the Commission plans for encouraging bicycle part manufacturers to invest in the country over the next three years with a view to adapting its industry towards a greater independence in its supplies and the building-up of a local industry supplying originating materials for the manufacture of bicycles. Meanwhile, according to Cambodia, in order for the industry to remain viable in the short term, Cambodian manufacturers still need to rely on using bicycle parts under the rules on regional cumulation, for the purposes of exports to the Union under the GSP scheme.
(9) Therefore, Cambodia requests a three-year derogation to give it sufficient time to prepare itself to comply with the rules for the acquisition of origin.
(10) In the light of the explanations given by Cambodia, to allow it to genuinely consolidate a bicycle parts industry it is considered that an unlimited derogation is not necessary for Cambodia. A limitation of the quantities of bicycles originating in and exported from Cambodia under this derogation should thus be provided for, in the form of a quota whose quantities should decrease over the three years during which that derogation will be applicable. The quantities have been established on the basis of the models of bicycles for which the country needs the derogation for meeting the abovementioned 70 % threshold and should be managed in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(11) In order to allow efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation, it is necessary to lay down the obligation for the authorities of Cambodia to communicate regularly to the Commission details of the certificates of origin Form A which have been issued within the framework of the derogation.
(12) The derogation should concern products of HS heading 8714 originating in Malaysia.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '29.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 223/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 822/2014\nof 28 July 2014\non a derogation from Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 as regards the rules of origin under the scheme of generalised tariff preferences in respect of bicycles produced in Cambodia regarding the use under cumulation of bicycle parts originating in Malaysia', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Regulation (EU) No 978/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences from 1 January 2014, the Union granted generalised tariff preferences to Cambodia.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(4)establishes the definition of the concept of originating products to be used for the purpose of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences (‘GSP’).

On the basis of monitoring of management he shall give an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken.\n\nC. INFORMATION AND PUBLICITY\n\nIn the framework of this action, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicized.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n- make potential recipients and professional organisations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n\n- make the general public aware of the Community\'s role in the programme.\n\nFrance and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the Monitoring Committee.\n\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\n\nII.

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, for ease of monitoring and in view of the implementation difficulties encountered in the past, the method of calculating the increase in the alcoholic strength of the cuvée when the tirage liqueur is added should be specified;
Whereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2332/92 (4) provides that Member States may exceptionally permit, until 31 December 1995, that the production process of quality sparkling wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) may involve adding to the cuvée one or more wine-sector products which do not originate in the specified region whose name the wine bears; whereas that period has proved too short to allow operators in certain specified regions to adapt to the technical requirements laid down; whereas it should accordingly be extended; whereas, since this exception covers specific cases only, provision should be made for the names of those quality sparkling wines psr to be indicated in a list and published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Communities;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 83 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EEC) No 1017/68 of the Council of 19 July 1968 applying rules of competition to transport by rail, road and inland waterway (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Rules of competition for transport by rail, road and inland waterway are part of the common transport policy and of general economic policy.
(3) Rules of competition for those sectors should take account of the distinctive features of transport.
(4) Since the rules of competition for transport derogate from the general rules of competition, it should be made possible for undertakings to ascertain what rules apply in any particular case.
(5) The system of rules on competition for transport should apply equally to the joint financing or acquisition of transport equipment for the joint operation of services by certain groupings of undertakings, and also to certain operations in connection with transport by rail, road or inland waterway of providers of services ancillary to transport.
(6) In order to ensure that trade between Member States is not affected or competition within the internal market distorted, it is necessary to prohibit in principle for the three modes of transport specified above all agreements between undertakings, decisions of associations of undertakings and concerted practices between undertakings and all instances of abuse of a dominant position within the internal market which could have such effects.
(7) Certain types of agreement, decision and concerted practice in the transport sector the object and effect of which is merely to apply technical improvements or to achieve technical cooperation may be exempted from the prohibition on restrictive agreements since they contribute to improving productivity. In the light of experience following application of this Regulation, the Council may, on a proposal from the Commission, amend the list of such types of agreement.
(8) In order that an improvement may be fostered in the sometimes too dispersed structure of the industry in the road and inland waterway sectors, exemption from the prohibition on restrictive agreements should also be granted in the case of those agreements, decisions and concerted practices providing for the creation and operation of groupings of undertakings in these two transport sectors whose object is the carrying on of transport operations, including the joint financing or acquisition of transport equipment for the joint operation of services. Such overall exemption can be granted only on condition that the total carrying capacity of a grouping does not exceed a fixed maximum, and that the individual capacity of undertakings belonging to the grouping does not exceed certain limits so fixed as to ensure that no one undertaking can hold a dominant position within the grouping. The Commission should, however, have power to intervene if, in specific cases, such agreements should have effects incompatible with the conditions under which a restrictive agreement may be recognised as lawful, and should constitute an abuse of the exemption. Nevertheless, the fact that a grouping has a total carrying capacity greater than the fixed maximum, or cannot claim the overall exemption because of the individual capacity of the undertakings belonging to the grouping, does not in itself prevent such a grouping from constituting a lawful agreement, decision or concerted practice if it satisfies the relevant conditions laid down in this Regulation.
(9) It is for the undertakings themselves, in the first instance, to judge whether the predominant effects of their agreements, decisions or concerted practices are the restriction of competition or the economic benefits acceptable as justification for such restriction and to decide accordingly, on their own responsibility, as to the illegality or legality of such agreements, decisions or concerted practices.
(10) Therefore, undertakings should be allowed to conclude or operate agreements without declaring them. This exposes such agreements to the risk of being declared void with retroactive effect should they be examined following a complaint or on the Commission’s own initiative, but does not prevent their being retroactively declared lawful in the event of such subsequent examination,","{'header': '5.3.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 61/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 169/2009\nof 26 February 2009\napplying rules of competition to transport by rail, road and inland waterway\n(Codified version)\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EEC) No\xa01017/68 of the Council of 19\xa0July\xa01968 applying rules of competition to transport by rail, road and inland waterway(3)has been substantially amended several times(4).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, the first subparagraph of point 1 of Article 8, point 4 of Article 8 and Article 9(4)(c) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (2), and in particular Articles 23(1), 24(2) and 25(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 (3) lays down veterinary certification requirements for imports into and transit, including storage during transit, through the Union of poultry and poultry products (‘the commodities’). It provides that the commodities may only be imported into and transit through the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in columns 1 and 3 of the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also lays down the conditions for a third country, territory, zone or compartment to be considered as free from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
(3) The United States is listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as a third country from which imports into and transit through the Union of the commodities are authorised from the whole of its territory.
(4) An Agreement between the Union and the United States (4) provides for a swift mutual recognition of regionalisation measures in the event of outbreaks of a disease in the Union or in the United States (‘the Agreement’).
(5) On 19 December 2014, the United States confirmed the presence of HPAI of subtype H5N8 in a poultry holding in Douglas County in the State of Oregon and on 3 January 2015 HPAI of subtype H5N2 in a poultry holding in the State of Washington. The whole territory of that third country may therefore no longer be considered as being free from that disease. The veterinary authorities of the United States immediately suspended issuing veterinary certificates from the whole of its territory for consignments of poultry commodities intended for import into and transit through the Union. The United States has also implemented a stamping-out policy in order to control HPAI and limit its spread.
(6) The United States has submitted information on the epidemiological situation on its territory and the measures it has taken to prevent the further spread of HPAI which has now been evaluated by the Commission. On the basis of that evaluation, as well as the commitments laid down in the Agreement and the guarantees provided by the United States, it is appropriate to conclude that limiting the restrictions on the introduction into the Union of commodities to the HPAI affected area in the State of Oregon and to the entire State of Washington, which the veterinary authorities of the United States have placed under restrictions due to the current outbreaks, should be sufficient to cover the risks associated with the introduction into the Union of the commodities. The entry for the United States in the list in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended to take account of the regionalisation of that third country due to the current outbreaks of HPAI.
(7) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '17.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 41/5', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/243\nof 13 February 2015\namending Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 as regards the entry for the United States in the list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which certain poultry commodities may be imported into or transit through the Union in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008(3)lays down veterinary certification requirements for imports into and transit, including storage during transit, through the Union of poultry and poultry products (‘the commodities’).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(4) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (1), and in particular Article 3(5) thereof;
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (2), and in particular Article 8(5) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 (5) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules and in particular Article 48(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 63(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 97/78/EC provides that veterinary checks on products from third countries introduced into the Union are to be carried out by Member States in accordance with that Directive and with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 lays down general rules for the performance of official controls to verify compliance with rules aiming, in particular, at preventing, eliminating or reducing to acceptable levels risks to humans and animals, either directly or through the environment.
(3) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down the general animal health rules governing all stages of the production, processing and distribution within the Union and the introduction from third countries of products of animal origin and products obtained intended for human consumption.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators. Article 6(4) of that Regulation provides that food business operators importing food containing both products of plant origin and processed products of animal origin (composite products) are to ensure that the processed products of animal origin contained in such food satisfy certain public health requirements laid down therein. In addition, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 provides that food business operators must be able to demonstrate that they have done so, for example through appropriate documentation or certification.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 applies from 1 January 2006. However, the application of a number of measures laid down therein with immediate effect from that date would have presented practical difficulties in certain cases.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 (6) therefore provided that, by way of derogation from Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, food business operators importing food containing composite products were to be exempt from the obligation provided for in that Article.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down transitional measures for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) repealed and replaced Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005. Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 contains the same derogation from Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 as did Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005.
(8) In addition, Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 provides that imports of composite products are to comply with the harmonised Union rules, where applicable, and with the national rules implemented by the Member States in other cases.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 applies until 31 December 2013.
(10) Commission Decision 2007/275/EC of 17 April 2007 concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC (8) provides that certain composite products are to be subject to veterinary checks, when imported into the Union. Pursuant to that Decision, the composite products subjected to veterinary checks are all those containing processed meat products, those containing half or more of their substance of any one processed product of animal origin other than processed meat products and those containing no processed meat products and less than half of their substance of processed milk product where the final products do not meet certain requirements laid down in Decision 2007/275/EC.
(11) In addition, Decision 2007/275/EC lays down certain certification requirements regarding the composite products subject to veterinary checks. It provides that composite products containing processed meat products are to be accompanied at introduction into the Union by the relevant certificate for meat products laid down in Union legislation. Composite products containing processed milk products, which are to be subjected to veterinary checks, are to be accompanied at introduction into the Union by the relevant certificate laid down in Union legislation. In addition, composite products containing only processed fishery or egg products which are to be subjected to veterinary checks are to be accompanied at introduction into the Union by the relevant certificate laid down in Union legislation or a commercial document where there is no certificate so required.
(12) The composite products subjected to veterinary checks pursuant to Decision 2007/275/EC are, by their very nature, the ones that may present also a higher public health risk. The levels of potential public health risk vary depending on the product of animal origin which is included in the composite product, the percentage in which that product of animal origin is present in the composite product and the treatments applied to it as well as the shelf stability of the composite product.
(13) It is therefore appropriate that the public health requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 apply to those composite products even before the expiry of the derogation provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009.
(14) In particular, the certification of compliance with public health requirements as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 should be provided for in this Regulation for the importation of the composite products containing processed meat products, of those composite products containing half or more of their substance of milk products or of processed fishery or egg products and of those composite products containing no processed meat products and less than half of their substance of processed milk products where the final products are not shelf-stable at ambient temperature or where they have not clearly undergone in their manufacture a complete cooking or heat treatment process throughout their substance, so that any raw product is not denatured.
(15) As a consequence, the derogation laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 should no longer apply for those composite products.
(16) The animal health requirements concerning those composite products are already laid down in Union legislation. Pursuant to those requirements, those composite products should in particular only be imported from approved third countries.
(17) A specific model health certificate attesting that such composite products imported into the Union comply with those public and animal health requirements should be laid down in this Regulation. As a consequence, the certification requirements laid down in Decision 2007/275/EC should no longer apply for those composite products.
(18) For the other composite products containing half or more of their substance of products of animal origin other than milk products or fishery or egg products, the certification requirements laid down in Decision 2007/275/EC should continue to apply. However, for reasons of simplification and clarity of Union legislation, it is appropriate to include those certification requirements in this Regulation, so that the main rules on the certification of composite products be laid down in only one act.
(19) Decision 2007/275/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(20) Due to animal health reasons, a certificate and specific conditions for transit via the Union should be provided for. However these conditions should be applicable only to composite products containing processed meat products or processed dairy products.
(21) Specific conditions for transit via the Union of consignments to and from Russia should be provided for, owing to the geographical situation of Kaliningrad, which only concerns Latvia, Lithuania and Poland.
(22) To avoid any disruption of trade, the use of certificates issued in accordance with Decision 2007/275/EC prior to the date of application of this Regulation should be authorised for a transitional period.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme (3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

(1) In accordance with the offer it made within the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) and alongside its scheme of generalised preferences (GSP), the Community introduced tariff preferences in 1971 for jute and coconut-fibre products originating in certain developing countries; these preferences took the form of a gradual reduction of Common Customs Tariff duties and, from 1978 to 31 December 1994, the complete suspension of these duties.
(2) Since the entry into force of the new GSP scheme on 1 January 1995, the Community has, alongside the GATT, opened autonomous zero-duty Community tariff quotas for specific quantities of jute and coconut-fibre products until 31 December 2001 by Council Regulation (EC) No 764/96(2), as amended by Regulations (EC) No 1401/98(3) and (EC) No 32/2000.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of L-selenomethionine. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) That application concerns the authorisation of L-selenomethionine, an organic compound of selenium, as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 2 May 2013 (2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, L-selenomethionine does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment and that its use may be considered as an efficient source of selenium for all animal species. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of L-selenomethionine shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) The Authority concluded that the limitation of the supplementation with organic selenium established for other organic compounds of selenium should also apply to L-selenomethionine. Furthermore, in case different compounds of selenium are added to the feed, the supplementation with organic selenium should not exceed 0,2 mg per kg complete feed.
(7) The applicant delivered supplementary data consequently to the abovementioned opinion of the Authority to prove the stability of the additive once it is incorporated in premixtures containing compounds of trace elements.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the Commission proposal submitted after consultations within the Advisory Committee, as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
1. The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 (2) imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
B. Subsequent procedure
2. Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, a Chinese exporter representing a significant percentage of the trade involved requested the extension of the period of validity of the provisional anti-dumping duty for a further period of two months, which was granted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3521/85 (3).
C. Dumping
3. No new evidence on dumping has been submitted by the Chinese exporters since the imposition of the provisional duty. The findings on dumping for the People's Republic of China as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 should therefore be confirmed.
D. Injury
4. As no fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry was received and in particular no evidence was submitted that imports from other non-member countries have been sold at lower prices than those from the People's Republic of China or have been dumped, the findings on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 should therefore be confirmed.
E. Community interest
5. No new evidence has been submitted by Community consumers since the extension of the provisional anti-dumping duty. The findings on Community interest as set out in Regulation 2317/85 should remain, therefore, unchanged.
F. Undertaking
6. The Chinese exporters concerned were informed that the main findings of the preliminary investigation had been confirmed. An undertaking was subsequently offered by one of the exporters which the Commission considered would eliminate the injury found and which was, therefore, considered acceptable.
G. Definitive duty
7. In the light of the above findings, the amount of the definitive anti-dumping duty for the exports not subject to the abovementioned undertaking should, in principle, be the same as the amount of the provisional anti-dumping duty. However, since the investigation with regard to the USSR exporter and one of the Chinese exporters resulted in the acceptance of a price undertaking and in order to ensure an equitable treatment of imports at different prices it is considered appropriate to impose on the product originating in the People's Republic of China a variable anti-dumping duty based on a minimum price with effect similar to the effect of the ad-valorem duty provisionally imposed. It would be sufficient to eliminate the injury if the amount of the duty corresponded to the amount by which the free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is less than 0,56 ECU per metre.
H. Collection of provisional duties
8. The amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the People's Republic of China should be definitively collected in full.","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EEC) No 338/86 of 14 February 1986 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the People' s Republic of China and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on those imports"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses(1), as amended by Directive 96/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 4(1) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee for Food,
(1) Whereas Article 6 of Commission Directive 91/321/EEC(3), as last amended by Directive 96/4/EC(4), provides that infant formulae and follow-on formulae shall not contain any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants and young children and that necessary maximum levels for such substances shall be established without delay;
(2) Whereas different regulations on the maximum levels of pesticide residues in such products cause trade barriers between certain Member States;
(3) Whereas maximum levels for pesticide residues stipulated in Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables(5), as last amended by Directive 97/41/EC(6), 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(7), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/82/EC(8), 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(9), as last amended by Directive 98/82/EC, and 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables(10), as last amended by Directive 98/82/EC, are without prejudice to specific provisions applicable to infant formulae and follow-on formulae;
(4) Whereas, taking into account the Community's international obligations, in cases where the relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, the precautionary principle allows the Community to provisionally adopt measures on the basis of available pertinent information, pending an additional assessment of risk and a review of the measure within a reasonable period of time;
(5) Whereas on the basis of the two opinions given by the Scientific Committee for Food on 19 September 1997 and 4 June 1998 there are at present doubts as to the adequacy of existing acceptable daily intake values (ADI) for the protection of the health of infants and young children; whereas the doubts expressed concern not only pesticides and pesticide residues, but also dangerous chemical substances, and consequently the Commission will examine the possibility of fixing, as soon as possible, maximum levels for heavy metals in foods intended for infants and young children;
(6) Whereas, therefore, as far as foods for particular nutritional uses intended for infants and young children are concerned, it is appropriate to adopt a very low common limit for all pesticides;
(7) Whereas this very low common limit should be fixed at 0,01 mg/kg which is in practice the minimum detectable level;
(8) Whereas severe limitations on pesticide residues should be required; whereas, with careful selection of raw materials, and given that infant formulae and follow-on formulae undergo extensive processing during their manufacture, it is feasible to produce products containing very low levels of pesticide residues;
(9) Whereas, however, for a small number of pesticides even such low levels might allow the possibility that under worst-case intake conditions the ADI of these pesticides is exceeded; whereas, therefore, infant formulae and follow-on formulae should be free of those particular pesticides and should be produced without the use of such pesticides;

Portugal and the Commission shall immediately exchange all relevant information in regard to the outcome of an inspection.\n\n11. For three years following the last payment relating to the assistance the authority responsible for implementation shall keep available to the Commission all documentary evidence of expenditure incurred.\n\n12. When it submits applications for payment Portugal shall make available to the Commission all official reports relating to supervision of the measures in question.\n\nReduction, suspension and withdrawal of aid\n\n13. Portugal and the recipients of aid shall declare that Community funds are used for the intended purposes. If implementation of a measure appears to require only part of the financial assistance allotted the Commission shall immediately recover the  amount due. In cases of dispute the Commission shall examine the case within the partnership framework, asking Portugal or the other authorities designated by Portugal for implementation of the measure to submit their comments within two months.\n\n14. The Commission may reduce or suspend aid for a measure if the examination confirms the existence of an irregularity, in particular of a substantial modification affecting the nature or conditions of implementation of the measure for which approval  by the Commission has not been sought.\n\nRecovery of undue payments\n\n15. All sums unduly paid must be reimbursed to the Commission by the designated authority indicated in point 8. Interest may be levied on sums not reimbursed.

Portugal shall ensure that:\n\n- suitable action is taken in this area,\n\n- any amount unduly paid as a result of an irregularity is recovered,\n\n- action is taken to prevent irregularities.\n\nB. Monitoring and assessment\n\nI. Monitoring Committee\n\n1. Establishment\n\nA Monitoring Committee for the operational programme shall be set up by Portugal and the Commission. It shall review implementation of the programme every three months and, in appropriate cases, propose any adjustments required.\n\n2. The composition, operation and frequency of meetings of the Committee shall be decided within three months of its establishment.\n\n3. Competence of Monitoring Committee\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- shall have as its general responsibility the satisfactory progress of the operational programme towards attainment of the objectives set. Its competence shall embrace the programme measures within the limits of the Community aid granted. It shall keep  watch on respect for the regulatory provisions, including those on eligibility of operations and projects,\n\n- shall, on the basis of information on the selection of projects already approved and implemented, reach an opinion on application of the selection criteria set out in the operational programme,\n\n- shall propose any action required to accelerate implementation of the programme in the light of the information furnished periodically by the interim monitoring and assessment indicators,\n\n- may, in agreement with the Commission representative(s), adjust the financing plans within a limit of 15 % of the Community contribution to a sub-programme or measure for the entire period, or 20 % for any year, provided that the total amount  scheduled in the operational programme is not exceeded. Care must be taken to see that the main objectives of the operational programme are not thereby compromised,\n\n- shall give its opinion on the adjustments proposed to the Commission,\n\n- shall issue an opinion on technical assistance projects scheduled in the operational programme,\n\n- shall give its opinion on draft annual implementation reports,\n\n- shall report regularly to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on the progress of the programme and expenditure incurred, at least twice a year.\n\nII. Monitoring and assessment of the operational programme during the implementation period (continuous monitoring and assessment)\n\n1. The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous monitoring and assessment of the operational programme.\n\n2. Continuous monitoring means an information system on the state of progress of the programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the operational programme. It involves reference to the financial and physical indicators  structured so as to permit assessment of the correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the degree of realization.\n\n3. Continuous assessment of an operational programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to guarantee correspondence between measures and  programme objectives.\n\nImplementation report and scrutiny of operational programmes\n\n4. Portugal shall notify to the Commission, within three months of adoption of the operational programme, the name of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the annual implementation report. Three months after its appointment this  authority shall present to the Commission a proposal for standard presentation of implementation reports.\n\nThe annual report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the Commission and to the Standing Committee on Plant Health before 31 August 1994. On the basis of the information therein Portugal will be able if appropriate  to apply for a new programme for future years.\n\n5. The Commission may jointly with Portugal call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3 above. He may submit proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or  measures, modification of the selection criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the administrative measures to be taken.  To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will not pay the entire cost of employing him.\n\nIII. Retrospective assessment of economic impact\n\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished). A first assessment of the immediate phytosanitary and economic impact should be made  on the basis of the indicators agreed.\n\nC. Information and publicity\n\nIn the framework of this programme, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure that it is adequately publicized.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n- make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered under the programme measures,\n\n- make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\n\nPortugal and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the Commission of information and publicity measures  adopted, either by an annual report or through the Monitoring Committee.\n\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\n\nII. COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES  Community policies applying in this field must be complied with.\n\nThe operational programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and compliance with Community policies. The following information must be supplied by Portugal.\n\n1.

(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one-hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.

(1) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) concluded in its opinion of 20 June 2006 that ‘Although 4-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is presently permitted and used as a sunscreen, it became apparent in the process of evaluation of the dossier that much of the information did not conform to current standards and guidelines’. In order to carry out a proper risk assessment of 4-aminobenzoic acid the SCCP required a new dossier with additional safety data conform to modern standards and SCCP guidelines to be submitted by the cosmetics industry before 1 July 2007.

(3) Without a proper risk assessment 4-aminobenzoic acid can not be considered safe for use as a UV-filter in cosmetics and should therefore be deleted from Annex VII and listed in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.
(4) Regarding Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate (INCI), the SCCP concluded in its opinion of 15 April 2008 that the use of this substance at a maximum concentration of 10 % in cosmetic products, including sunscreen products, does not pose a risk to the consumer. In order to extend the scope of the allowed use of this substance column ‘c’ of entry 28 should be amended in Annex VII to Directive 76/768/EEC.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (‘Single CMO’ Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 143 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The representative prices and additional duties applicable to imports of white sugar, raw sugar and certain syrups have been fixed for the 2012/2013 marketing year by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 892/2012 (2).
(2) Article 141(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishes that additional import duties are not be imposed where the imports are unlikely to disturb the Community market, or where the effects would be disproportionate to the intended objective.
(3) For a significant period of time, sugar prices in the Union market have been far above the reference price and, based on current market forecast, it is not expected that the world market price of sugar would be reduced to such levels that, taking into account the current import tariff, the imports of sugar would disturb the EU sugar market in the absence of additional duties. Under these circumstances of relatively high world market prices, imports of sugar products covered by Article 36(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 of 30 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards trade with third countries in the sugar sector (3) are not likely to disturb the Union market and consequently no additional duties on these imports should be imposed. Taking into account the fundamentals of the world and Union sugar markets, this situation is unlikely to change significantly for the next two marketing years, i.e. till the end of the Union quota regime.The Commission monitors constantly the sugar market and shall take any appropriate measures if necessary.
(4) As long as additional duties are not imposed, there is no need to fix the representative prices which are used to calculate them.

of 31 July 1987
opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for herring, fresh or chilled, falling within subheading ex 03.01 B I a) 2 aa) of the Common Customs Tariff, originating in Sweden
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas an agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Sweden was concluded on 22 July 1972; whereas, following the accession of Spain and Portugal, an Agreement in the form of Exchange of Letters was concluded between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Sweden on the Agricultural and Fisheries sector; whereas this Agreement was adopted by Decision 86/558/EEC (1);
Whereas this Agreement provides for the opening, over a period to be determined by common accord, of a 20 000 tonnes duty free Community tariff quota for herring, fresh or chilled, whole, headless or in pieces, originating in Sweden; whereas, therefore, the tariff quota in question should be opened for the period 15 September 1987 to 14 February 1987 and allocated among the Member States;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of levy for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is used up; whereas, in the light of the principles outlined above, a Community tariff arrangement based on an allocation between the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to represent as closely as possible the actual development of the market in the said goods, the allocation should follow proportionately the requirements calculated both from statistics of imports from Sweden during a representative reference period and according to the economic outlook for the tariff year in question;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports of this type of fish, originating in Sweden, into each of the Member States were as follows (in tonnes):
(tonnes)
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member State  // 1984   // 1985  // 1986   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 1 093   // 310  // 58   // Denmark   // 37 900   // 30 783   // 25 045  // Germany   // 2 822   // 1 563   // 1 460   // Spain   // 0  // 0   // 0   // Greece   // 0   // 0   // 0   // France  // 3   // 0   // 0   // Ireland   // 16   // 0   // 0  // Italy   // 0   // 0   // 0   // Portugal   // 0   // 0  // 0   // United Kingdom   // 0   // 0   // 0   //    //   //  //   //   // 41 834   // 32 656   // 26 563   //    //   //  //
Whereas, during the last years under consideration, the products in question were imported only by certain Member States and not at all by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, initial shares should be allocated to the importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quota upon imports into those States of the products concerned being notified; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, taking into account these factors and the forecasts made by certain Member States, the initial percentage shares in the quota volume can be set approximately as follows:
1.2 // Member State   //   // Benelux   // 1,45   // Denmark
(1) OJ No L 328, 22. 11. 1986, p. 89.
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover the subsequent requirements of these Member States where they have used up their initial share and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, it is appropriate to fix the first instalment of the Community quota at a level which, in the circumstances, could be 67 % of the quota volume;
Whereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas, each time its additional share is almost used up, a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused, it is essential that such State should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/87 of 31 July 1987 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for herring, fresh or chilled, falling within subheading ex 03.01 B I a) 2 aa) of the Common Customs Tariff, originating in Sweden', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) no 1202/90 (2), and in particular Article 18 (2) thereof,
Whereas the marketing of frozen strowberries, frozen raspberries, provisionally preserved strowberries and provisionally preserved raspberries is characterized by competition from third countries at prices significantly below the prices at which Community products can be marketed; whereas there is a failure to comply with the price levels agreed with the main supplier third countries for the 1989/86 marketing year; whereas imports in 1989 and the first six months of 1990 were significantly higher than the average for the last three years;
Whereas in these circumstances the Community market is exposed to serious disturbances which might endanger the objectives set out in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas it is therefore necessary to apply protective measures;
Whereas the aim of the protective measures should be to exclude the marketing of imported products at abnormally low prices;
Whereas, taking account of the criteria set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No 521/77 of 14 March 1977 laying down detailed rules for applying protective measures in the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables (3), this objective can be achieved by introducing minimum import prices to be respected on import into the Community and by applying countervailing charges on products which do not respect those prices;
Whereas the level of the minimum prices should be set talking account of the prices previously agreed with the country in question and the quality and presentated of the products concerned;
Whereas the minimum import prices may be undercut due to events which are not a consequence of prices applied by third countries, e.g. fluctuation of exchange rates; whereas that fact should be taken into consideration when countervailing charges are fixed;
Whereas countervailing charges should not be levied in respect of products coming from third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee the prices of products exported by them and that any deflections of trade will be avoided;
Whereas account should be taken of the special situation of products which have already left the exporting counry at the time this Regulation is published,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2198/90 of 27 July 1990 on protective measures applicable to imports of frozen strowberries, frozen raspberries, provisionally preserved strowberries and provisionally preserved raspberries originating in Poland', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) Council and Commission Decision 2005/430/EC, Euratom of 18 April 2005 on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Bulgaria, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union (4), and Council and Commission Decision 2005/431/EC, Euratom of 25 April 2005 on the conclusion of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, to take account of the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union (5), provide for additional concessions as regards pigmeat products.
(3) The arrangements should be managed by means of import licences, and detailed rules on the submission of applications and the particulars which are to appear on applications and licences should be defined, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6).
(4) Licences should be issued after a period of consideration and should be subject, where applicable, to a uniform percentage reduction.
(5) In order to ensure proper management of the quantities, the expiry date for licences should be set at the end of each quota year.
(6) In order to ensure efficient management of the arrangements, the amount of the security for import licences under those arrangements should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the arrangements in the pigmeat sector, traders' access to the arrangements should be subject to compliance with specific conditions.
(7) In order to guarantee proper management of the arrangements, Member States should provide the Commission with precise information on the quantities actually imported. For reasons of clarity, a single form is to be used for the transmission of information on quantities between the Member States and the Commission.
(8) In order to guarantee a smooth transition to the new arrangements and, in particular, ensure that products falling under serial numbers 09.4752 and 09.4756 which are imported under licences as from 1 July 2005 in the context of the additional Protocols benefit from the lowering of customs duty to 0 %, provision should be made for refunding the amounts paid in excess, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (7) and by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (8).
(9) Following the accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic to the European Union, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/97 of 29 September 1997 laying down rules of application in the pigmeat sector for the arrangements covered by the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania, the Republic of Poland and the Republic of Hungary (9) now relate to only Bulgaria and Romania. It is necessary, therefore, to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1898/97 and adopt a new Regulation laying down detailed rules for applying the trade aspects of the Europe Agreements with those two countries in the pigmeat sector.
(10) The annual quantities to be imported are set for periods beginning on 1 July.
(11) The Additional Protocols to the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria and Romania are to enter into force on the first day of the month following that in which the last instrument of approval is lodged.
(12) For Bulgaria, the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement is 1 July 2005. Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Bulgaria from that date.
(13) For Romania, the date of entry into force of the Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement is 1 August 2005. Provision should therefore be made for this Regulation to apply to Romania from that date.

(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.

(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2).

","COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1025/97 of 6 June 1997 concerning imports of certain textile products originating in the Russian Federation
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1937/96 (2) and in particular Article 12 (2) and Article 17 (6), in conjunction with Article 25 (5) thereof,
Whereas the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Community and the Russian Federation on trade in textile products initialled on 19 December 1995 expired on 31 December 1996 and whereas, pending the resumption and completion of negotiations directed towards the initialling of a new agreement with the Russian Federation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2446/96 (3) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 562/97 (4) was adopted in order to safeguard the economic interests of the Community in the further conduct of trade in textile products with that country;
Whereas the measures brought in by that Regulation are to apply until 30 June 1997, by which date it appears unlikely that a new textiles agreement can be negotiated and brought into application;
Whereas it is necessary, given the sensitivity of the textiles and clothing sector to introduce an import regime for the second six months of 1997 setting quantitative limits for imports of certain textile products originating in the Russian Federation;
Whereas experience of administering the quantitative limits established by Regulation (EC) No 2446/96 has shown that for certain categories of products requests for import authorizations considerably exceeded the quantitative limits; whereas it is appropriate to introduce more precise criteria for management in order to ensure that requests for authorization of imports correspond to a real intention to import; whereas for this purpose the issue of an import authorization should be subject to the presentation of a contract;
Whereas in order to allow as many traders as possible access to the quantitative limits it also appears appropriate to limit the quantities allocated by each licence to a maximum amount; whereas with a view to an optimal utilization of the quantitative limits it is also appropriate to provide that each operator is only able to present a new request for authorization of imports after having used 50 % of the quantity covered by a previously issued licence;
Considering that with a view to ensuring an optimal utilization of the quantitative limits it is appropriate to fix the duration of validity of the import licences to three months from the date of their issue;
Whereas in order to ensure the continuity of trade it is appropriate to introduce new quantitative limits covering the rest of the year 1997 and that these limits should be set by reference to the period covered together with an increase which does not prejudge the results of the negotiation of a new textiles agreement;
Whereas for categories 2, 2a, 39, 117 and 118, the quantitative limits for which were exhausted shortly after their introduction by Regulation (EC) No 2446/96, it is necessary in order to ensure the continuity of trade to render the new quantitative limits, under the new rules of management, accessible from the date of entry into force of this Regulation;
Whereas for the other categories of products, for which the quantitative limits have not been completely exhausted it is appropriate that the new rules of management and the new quantitative limits be applicable following the date of expiry of Regulation (EC) No 2446/96, that is from 1 July 1997;
Whereas it is necessary to make it clear that the provisions of this Regulation do not prevent imports of textile products covered by a valid import licence issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2446/96;
Whereas in the interim the negotiations to reach a new bilateral agreement between the Community and the Russian Federation before the expiry of this present Regulation will continue;
Whereas the reduced number of quantitative restrictions in comparison with those existing in the agreement as well as the increased levels provided for in this Regulation are introduced on the basis that the Russian Federation will not adopt, during the validity of this Regulation, measures in the textiles and clothing sector concerning quantitative restrictions, or increased tariffs or non-tariff barriers such as certification or other import requirements applicable to import of products originating in the Community, other than those measures in force in the Russian Federation at the date of 1st January 1996; whereas the introduction of any such measure will therefore entail a review of the provisions of this Regulation;

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1002/2001 of 23 May 2001 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 24 May 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 May 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 252, 25.9.1999, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 175, 14.7.2000, p. 59.\n\n(3) OJ L 141, 24.6.1995, p. 12.\n\n(4) OJ L 145, 27.6.1968, p. 12.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 23 May 2001 fixing the representative prices and additional import duties to imports of molasses in the sugar sector\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Such a development would be likely to cause budget problems for the Community;
(2) an intervention threshold was fixed for tomatoes for the 1999 marketing year in Commission Regulation (EC) No 13/1999(3). Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product, a new threshold should be set for the 2000 marketing year equal to that set for the 1999 marketing year, and the period to be taken into account for the assessment of the overrun of the threshold should also be determined;
(3) pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27, an overrun of the intervention threshold results in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following the year in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of such an overrun should be determined and a reduction in proportion to the size of the overrun fixed, but restricted to a certain percentage;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the introductory phrase of Article 8, Article 8(4) and the third indent of Article 8(5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC (2), in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat (3) establishes the sanitary conditions for the importation into the Community of live animals, excluding equidae, and for the importation of fresh meat of such animals, including equidae, but excluding meat preparations.
(2) Article 6 of Decision 79/542/EEC concerns transport of live animals for importation into the Community. The transport of such animals by air presents a risk for animal health in the Community, due to insect vectors of animal diseases that could be present in the means of air transport. It is therefore appropriate to provide for measures for disinfestation of the means of such transport in order to avoid the accidental introduction into the Community of potentially infected insect vectors together with imported animals.
(3) Decision 79/542/EEC provides that animals intended for import into the Community can transit only through third countries which are permitted to export animals of the same species to the Community. However, it is permitted to transit animals through certain third countries that are not permitted to export animals to the Community. Such transit is only permitted if the animals are intended for immediate slaughter once they have reached their final destination in the Community. The procedure for listing those third countries has been established taking into account several factors, in particular the animal health situation of the third country, the guarantees about the integrity of the animals during transit, the controls at the border inspection posts and at the final destination.
(4) Animal welfare and traceability aspects should also be taken into account when considering the transport of animals to the Community from or via third countries. The Community rules currently in force lead to a situation where bovine animals for fattening must be transported on longer routes, in order to avoid transit through certain third countries that are not permitted to export animals to the Community. This has a negative impact on animal welfare. It is therefore appropriate to extend also to bovine animals for fattening the possibility for transit through third countries that are not permitted to export animals to the Community.
(5) In addition, it is necessary to ensure an adequate animal health protection in the Community when animals for fattening are introduced after having transited through third countries that are not permitted to export animals to the Community. Appropriate measures should therefore be established, to be applied both during transit and at the final destination. Those measures should ensure the animal health status of the animals and the integrity of the consignment during transport, and limit further movements of the animals from the farms of destination in the Community.
(6) The farms of destination should be specifically designated by the competent veterinary authority of the Member State of destination. When designating such farms, the competent veterinary authority should, in particular, ensure a control of the animals throughout the period from the date of arrival on the farm until the date of slaughter.
(7) Decision 79/542/EEC, as amended by Commission Decision 2008/752/EC (4), includes a reference to the compulsorily notifiable diseases listed in Annex A to Council Directive 90/426/EEC (5) in the animal health certificates for certain meat from domestic and wild solipeds. However, since only African horse sickness and glanders may be transmitted through the meat, those certificates should include specific references only to those diseases.
(8) For reasons of clarity and consistency of Community legislation, the model of animal health certificate for ‘Transit/Storage’ should be deleted from Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC and Annex III to that Decision should be replaced.
(9) Decision 79/542/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) By European Council Decision 2012/419/EU (2), the European Council decided to amend the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014. From that date, Mayotte will cease to be an overseas country or territory and will become an outermost region of the Union within the meaning of Article 349 and Article 355(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Following this amendment of the legal status of Mayotte, Union law will apply to Mayotte from 1 January 2014. Taking account of the particular structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, certain specific measures aimed at laying down the conditions of application of Union law should be established.
(2) Considering the specific structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, in particular the fact that the labour market is underdeveloped and the employment rate is low due to its remoteness, insularity, difficult topography and climate, an additional implementation period for Council Directive 2010/18/EU (3) should be provided for in order to ensure that equal treatment in the particular field of parental leave is achieved progressively and in a way that does not destabilise the gradual economic development of Mayotte. That additional implementation period should allow the specific disadvantaged structural social and economic situation of Mayotte, as a new outermost region, to be improved.
(3) Directive 2010/18/EU should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '28.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 353/7', 'title': 'COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2013/62/EU\nof 17 December 2013\namending Directive 2010/18/EU implementing the revised Framework Agreement on parental leave concluded by BUSINESSEUROPE, UEAPME, CEEP and ETUC, following the amendment of the status of Mayotte with regard to the European Union', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By European Council Decision 2012/419/EU(2), the European Council decided to amend the status of Mayotte with regard to the Union with effect from 1 January 2014.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular points (f) and (g) of Article 43, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 121/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) has established for 2012 and 2013 a scheme for the distribution of food to the most deprived persons in the Union, which applies until the completion of the 2013 annual plan.
(2) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012 (3) adopted the plan for the supply of food to the most deprived persons and allocated the adequate financial resources in charge of 2013 budget year. In accordance with Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 (4), the implementation period of an annual plan is to begin on 1 October and to finish on 31 December of the following year. In order to ensure a smooth transition to the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived when it is established in 2014, notably in terms of delivery of support, and in accordance with the requests that the Commission received from Spain, Poland and Slovenia an extension of the implementation period of the 2013 annual plan for the distribution of food for the benefit of the most deprived persons seems appropriate. In order to ensure equal treatment, the extension should be applicable for all Member States.
(3) As a result of judicial procedures launched against tender procedures, Greece has faced delays in the signature of public procurement contracts and has accordingly requested the extension of the deadline to submit payment requests mentioned in the first paragraph of Article 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012. In view of this request and of the difficult financial situation faced by Greece, it is appropriate to allow this extension. In order to ensure equal treatment, the derogation should apply to all Member States. As the deadline for the submission of payment requests was set at 30 September, this derogation should apply retrospectively.
(4) For accounting purposes, the advances paid by the Paying Agencies to beneficiaries as well as the clearing of advances at beneficiary level should be booked in the Commission’s annual accounts. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Member States to fix the date by which the beneficiaries of those payments should submit costs statements and certain other information related to advance payments. In addition, it is appropriate to set the deadline of the data provision from the Member States to the Commission as 1 February 2014, which corresponds to the deadline applicable to the provision of accounting information referred to in Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 (5).
(5) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1020/2012 should be amended accordingly.

Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 1418/97 (5) fixes the guide prices for wine for the 1997/98 wine year; whereas the prices, aids and other amounts for the various intervention measures to be adopted for that wine year should accordingly be fixed on that basis;
Whereas this Regulation applies to Austria and Portugal; whereas, however, since wine-growing zones have not been delimited in those countries, the oenological practices authorized in accordance with the rules laid down under Title II of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 should be defined for the 1997/98 wine year pending the adoption of definitive rules;
Whereas, since enrichment is an exceptional practice, the same reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and laid down in Annex VIII should be applied as in wine-growing zone C; whereas, in the light of experience the derogations in force for 'vinho verde` should be extended;
Whereas the aid for the use in wine-making of concentrated grape must and rectified concentrated grape must as provided for in Article 45 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 must be fixed taking into account the difference between the cost of enrichment achieved using concentrated grape must and using sucrose; whereas, in the light of the data available to the Commission, the amount of the aid should be varied with the product used for enrichment;
Whereas distillers may, in accordance with Articles 35 (6) and 36 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, either receive aid for the product to be distilled or deliver the product obtained from distillation to the intervention agency; whereas the amount of the aid must be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2468/96 (7);
Whereas the price of wine to be distilled under Articles 38 and 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 does not normally allow the marketing at market prices of products obtained from distillation; whereas provision must therefore be made for aid, the amount of which is to be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89, account also being taken of the present uncertainty of prices on the market for distillation products;
Whereas some wine delivered for one of the distillation operations may be processed into wine fortified for distillation; whereas the amounts applicable to distillation in accordance with the rules laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89 should be adjusted accordingly;
Whereas experience gained in sales by invitation to tender of alcohol held by intervention agencies shows that the difference between prices which may be obtained for neutral spirits and raw alcohol does not justify the takeover of the former; whereas, moreover, quantities of neutral spirits currently available are sufficient to satisfy, at least for one wine year, any demand for that product; whereas under these circumstances the possibility provided for in Articles 35, 36 and 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 should be used by producing for the buying-in of all alcohol at the price for raw alcohol;
Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2365/95 (9), laying down detailed rules for the application of compulsory distillation as provided for in Articles 35 and 36 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 sets a standard natural alcohol strength by volume to be applied in the various wine-growing zones for the purpose of determining the volume of alcohol to be delivered for distillation under Article 35 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87; whereas it has not been possible to fix this standard natural alcoholic strength in Portugal because the wine-growing zones in that country have not yet been delimited; whereas, therefore, a provisional standard natural alcohol strength should be fixed;
Whereas Article 46 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 lays down criteria for fixing the aid provided for in that Article; whereas, as regards the aid for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must for the manufacture of grape juice, paragraph 4 of that Article stipulates that a part of the aid should be set aside for the organization of campaigns to promote the consumption of grape juice and whereas the aid may be increased to that end; whereas, having regard to the criteria laid down and of the need to finance those campaigns, the aid should be fixed at a level permitting sufficient quantities to be obtained for the effective promotion of the product;
Whereas the reduction in the buying-in price for wine provided for in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 depends on the average increase in the natural alcoholic strength in each wine-growing zone; whereas experience shows that that increase corresponds on average to half the maximum increase authorized; whereas the reduction in the buying-in price must accordingly correspond to the added alcoholic strength as a percentage of the alcoholic strength of wine delivered for distillation;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3800/81 of 16 December 1981 determining the classification of vine varieties (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1914/96 (11), establishes the list of vine varieties recommended and authorized in Portugal; whereas, in assessing the production of wine in Portugal, reference should be made to those vine varieties;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal by the Commission  (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament  (2),
Whereas, in order to carry out the tasks imposed on it by the Treaty and the regulations concerning  the common agricultural policy, the Commission needs to have reliable, comparable and up-to-date  data, established by objective methods, on areas under cultivation, yields and production of crop  products other than cereals;
Whereas it is appropriate to recognize the importance of the crop production sector apart from  cereals for the organization and management of agricultural markets, which implies that the  requisite statistical survey should be conducted to an increasing degree on the basis of Community  rules;
Whereas account should be taken of the experience acquired by the statistical services with these  surveys over many years;
Whereas the purpose of this Regulation is to define the statistical information to be supplied, to  prescribe a satisfactory level of reliability and lay down additional technical information  necessary to assess production figures, to provide for objectivity and representativeness of  surveys on area and production by a broad exchange of experience, involving meetings and reports  and to fix the deadlines to be met;
Whereas, for some crop products other than cereals, the communication of regional data is also  required on an annual basis;
Whereas it is appropriate for the Commission to submit a report after three years of experience  with this Regulation, together with, if necessary, proposals for improving statistical surveys;
Whereas, during a transitional period, the changes to be made in statistical methods involve  additional work for Member States, which requires a financial contribution from the Community for  the period 1993 to 1995, such amount being deemed necessary as ECU 1 million per year;
Whereas, notwithstanding that the collection and treatment of data and the organization of surveys  at national level ought to remain the responsibility of the statistical services of the Member  States, the Commission must ensure the collection, coordination and harmonization of statistical  information at European level and provide for the harmonized methodologies for the management of  Community policies;
Whereas, in order to facilitate the application of this Regulation, close cooperation between the  Member States and the Commission should continue, in particular via the Standing Committee for  Agricultural Statistics set up by Decision 72/279/EEC  (3),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 959/93 of 5 April 1993 concerning statistical information to be supplied by Member States on crop products other than cereals', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMember States shall provide the Commission  with annual data on the production and area of crops, other than cereals, as specified in Articles  2 and 6 of this Regulation with due regard for Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11  June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical  Office of the European Communities  (4).\n\nSECTION II\n\nData to be supplied at national level'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Communities (1), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Basic Regulation`) to investigate the alleged circumvention by TEC Corporation, Tokyo (hereinafter referred to as 'TEC`) of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 993/93 (2) with regard to this company on imports of certain electronic weighing scales originating in Japan, by assembly operations in and/or transhipments through Indonesia of the same product subsequently exported to the Community, to make the imports of these electronic weighing scales subject to registration by the customs authorities pursuant to Article 14 (5) of the Basic Regulation and to propose to the Council the extension, where justified, of the above anti-dumping duty to the latter imports.
B. APPLICANTS
(2) The request has been lodged on 19 July 1996 by the following companies:
Bizerba GmbH & Co. KG, Campesa SA, Dataprocess SpA, Dataprocess Industria SpA, Testut SA, Lutrana SA, GEC Avery Limited, Maatschappij Van Berkel's Patent BV and Brevetti Van Berkel SpA.
According to the request, these companies are all manufacturers of retail electronic weighing scales whose collective output represents approximately 65 % of the total Community production of those scales.
C. PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned is retail electronic weighing scales which incorporate a digital display of the weight, unit price and price to be paid, whether or not including a means of printing this data (hereinafter referred to as 'REWS`). This product is currently classified within CN code 8423 81 50. This code is given for information only and has no binding effect on the classification of the product.
D. EVIDENCE
(4) The request contains sufficient evidence in accordance with the requirements of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation that the anti-dumping duty on imports of REWS produced by TEC and originating in Japan is being circumvented by assembly operations in and/or transhipments through Indonesia of REWS subsequently exported to the Community.
(5) The evidence is as follows:
(a) Since the initiation of the last anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of REWS originating in Japan on 26 February 1991, a clear change in the pattern of trade between Japan, Indonesia and the Community has taken place. Imports of REWS from Japan into the Community have decreased from 25 470 units in 1992 to 652 units in the first half of the year 1995, whereas imports of the same product from Indonesia have increased from 0 in 1993 to well over 1 000 units in the first half of the year 1995.
The complainants allege that all REWS imported into the Community from Indonesia are TEC branded products. This change in the pattern of trade is particularly illustrated, when considering TEC's imports of REWS into the United Kingdom: in 1994, 275 units were imported from Japan and 300 units from Indonesia, whereas in 1995 almost no imports were recorded from Japan and 801 units were imported from Indonesia.
This change in pattern of trade is alleged to stem from a practice, process or work for which there is insufficient due cause or economic justification other than the existence of the anti-dumping duty. It is contended that circumvention through Indonesia consists of assembly operations and/or transshipments of REWS whereas most of the respective parts used in the assembly operation in and/or of the finished products transhipped through Indonesia are in fact originating in Japan and imported from TEC. It is also alleged that any savings in labour costs by assembling in/transhipping through Indonesia cannot offset the additional handling, supervising and transportation costs caused by these assembly operations and/or transhipments. Consequently, the operations in Indonesia would only serve to avoid the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of REWS originating in Japan in respect of TEC.
(b) Furthermore, the request contains evidence that the remedial effects of the antidumping duty are being undermined in terms of quantities and in particular of prices of the product exported from Indonesia. This is preventing the Community industry from achieving a reasonable profit which would allow it to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change in the electronic manufacturing industry.
(c) Finally, the request contains evidence which shows that the prices at which the REWS imported from Indonesia are being sold in the Community are lower than the non-dumped level of the export price established in the anti-dumping investigation for the REWS assembled in Japan.
E. PROCEDURE
(6) In the light of the evidence contained in the request, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 (3) of the Basic Regulation, and to make imports into the Community of REWS from Indonesia subject to registration in accordance with Article 14 (5) of the said Regulation.
(i) Questionnaires
(7) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to TEC as well as to the Indonesian company named in the request which allegedly is involved in assembly and/or transhipment operations. Information, as appropriate, may be sought from Community producers.
(8) Other interested parties which can show that they are likely to be affected by the outcome of the investigation, should request a questionnaire from the Commission within 15 days of publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Any request for questionnaires must be made in writing to the address mentioned below, and should indicate the name, address, telephone and fax numbers of the requesting party.
The authorities of Japan and Indonesia will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(ii) Certificates of non-circumvention
(9) In accordance with Article 13 (4) of the Basic Regulation, certificates exempting the imports of the product concerned from registration or measures may be issued by the customs authorities to importers when the importation does not constitute circumvention.
Since the issue of these certificates requires the prior authorization of the Community institutions, requests for such authorizations should be addressed to the Commission as early as possible in the course of the investigation so that they may be considered on the basis of a thorough appraisal of their merits.
F. TIME LIMIT
(10) In the interest of sound administration, a period should be fixed within which interested parties, provided they can show that they are likely to be affected by the results of the investigations, may make their views known in writing. A period should also be fixed within which interested parties may make a written request for a hearing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
Furthermore, it should be stated that in cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limit, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1717/96 of 29 August 1996 initiating an investigation concerning the circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 993/93 on imports of certain electronic weighing scales originating in Japan by imports of the same product assembled in and/or transhipped through Indonesia and making the latter imports subject to registration', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn investigation pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 concerning imports into the Community from Indonesia of retail electronic weighing scales which incorporate a digital display of the weight, unit price and price to be paid, whether or not including a means of printing this data, falling within CN code ex 8423 81 50 (Taric code 8423 81 50*10), is hereby initiated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 13 (3) and 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register imports from Indonesia of the product described in Article 1, in order to ensure that, should the anti-dumping duty applicable to imports of retail electronic weighing scales originating in Japan with regard to TEC Corporation, Tokyo be extended to imports of this product from Indonesia, they may be collected from the date of such registration.\n\nRegistration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n\nImports shall not be subject to registration where they are accompanied by a customs certificate issued in accordance with Article 13 (4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas, in the rice sector, the conversion into national currency of import levies and export refunds by means of the agricultural conversion rate gives rise to deflections of trade with third countries; whereas, in order to remedy the situation, a conversion rate closer to economic reality should be applied;
Whereas the Commission's powers in the matter of import levies and export refunds include the power to introduce derogations within the meaning of Article 10 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85;
Whereas, for the purposes of administrative simplification, this conversion rate should be determined by means of a monetary coefficient, the calculation and application of which is based on the established practice for the calculation of monetary compenstory amounts;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as last amended by Directive 2000/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/92/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(3), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 93/92/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC. The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive.
(2) Developments in technology now permit an adaptation of Directive 93/92/EEC to technical progress. In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is therefore necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of the Directive concerned.
(3) To this end, it should be specified that lighting devices type-approved for vehicles in categories M1 and N1, in accordance with the relevant directives, may also be installed on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles. Provision should also be made to permit the optional installation of front fog lamps, rear fog lamps, reversing lamps and hazard warning devices on three-wheel mopeds and light quadricycles. Directive 93/92/EEC should be supplemented with the appropriate instructions for installing these devices. The wording of certain points in the English and Dutch versions should be aligned on the corresponding points in the other language versions.
(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(4), as last amended by Directive 2000/40/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5),","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2000/73/EC of 22 November 2000 adapting to technical progress Council Directive 93/92/EEC on the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on two- or three-wheel motor vehicles (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnexes II to VI to Directive 93/92/EEC are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 92 and 93 thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having given notice to the other Member States and the parties concerned to submit their comments within a stated period, in accordance with Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty,
Whereas:
I
On 30 July 1997 the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in Article 93(2) of the EC Treaty with regard to the provisions of the 26th framework plan of the joint Federal Government/Länder scheme for improving regional economic structures concerning the intensities of aid to promote teleworking (section II, point 2.4). Germany was informed of the decision by letter dated 18 August 1997 (SG(97) D/7104). The other Member States and interested parties were invited to submit their comments by way of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities(1).
Germany submitted its observations by letter dated 17 September 1997. The Commission received no comments from third parties or the other Member States.
II
The joint (Federal Government/Länder) scheme for improving regional economic structures (Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ""Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur"") is the main regional aid scheme in Germany. The relevant provisions implementing this general scheme during certain periods are laid down in so-called framework plans (Rahmenpläne). The 26th framework plan, covering the period 1997-2000 (2001), was notified to the Commission on 19 February 1997 pursuant to Article 93(3). The Commission approved all the amendments introduced by this plan, except those relating to the promotion of investment in teleworking. Germany informed the Commission that the plan would not be implemented until the Commission had given its approval.
Under the plan, investment in teleworking jobs would be eligible for regional investment aid provided that both the company investing and the place where the teleworker would be located are in an assisted area. The maximum aid intensity would be established according to the region where the investing company to which the teleworking job will be linked is located. Consequently, in cases where a company located in an assisted area falling under Article 92(3)(a) invested in teleworking jobs in an area falling under Article 92(3)(c), the aid intensity for the Article 92(3)(a) region would apply. The maximum aid intensity in the regions of eastern Germany falling under Article 92(3)(a) is 35 % gross (50 % in case of investments by SMEs); in assisted areas of western Germany falling under Article 92(3)(c), the maximum permissible aid intensity is 18 % gross (28 % in case of investment by SMEs).
The Commission, in opening the procedure, noted that the principal aim of the provisions governing regional investment aid is to promote job creation, improve incomes and foster demand in disadvantaged regions and that, consequently, the maximum aid intensities for investment aid should be determined by reference to the region where the investment was located and the teleworking carried out. It also took the view that the possibility of promoting teleworking jobs in an Article 92(3)(c) region to the same extent as in an Article 92(3)(a) region could mean that the intended incentive effect in the most disadvantaged regions would not be achieved through this type of investment.
III
Germany is of the opinion that investment in teleworking jobs would be most effective in the area where the investing company is located. Therefore, such investment should always qualify for the aid intensities permissible in the area where the investor, and not the job, is located, provided that both areas are assisted area. Companies located in an Article 92(3)(c) assisted area and investing in teleworking jobs in Article 92(3)(a) areas would consequently benefit only from the lower intensity applicable at their place of establishment.
Germany also maintains that there is no risk of aid being diverted from an Article 92(3)(a) area to an Article 92(3)(c) area. Since aid for investment in different Länder would always necessiatate the cooperation of, and co-financing from, at least two Länder, the competent authority in the Article 92(3)(a) area could always make sure that no aid was abusively diverted in favour of job creation in the other Land.
Lastly, Germany argued that the positive impact of teleworking on innovation and competitiveness would invariably benefit the investing company, with the amount of investment at the location of the teleworking job generally being rather limited. If certain services supplied by specialised workers were not available in an Article 92(3)(a) area, a company investing in such an area would be obliged to offer them the opportunity to work at their place of residence in an Article 92(3)(c) area in order to obtain their services.
IV
The provision whereby aid intensities for investment in teleworking jobs that exceed the maximum level are allowed in the region where the teleworking job would be located cannot be deemed compatible with the common market. The particularly high aid intensities permissible with a view to promoting regional development in disadvantaged areas falling under Article 92(3)(a) are designed to provide and effective remedy for the abnormally low standard of living and serious level of underemployment in those areas. Consenquently, only measures that contribute towards a higher standard of living and job creation in an Article 92(3)(a) area are eligible for investment aid up to an intensity permissible solely for such an area. Investment made by companies in such disadvantaged areas with a view to installing the technical equipment and links for teleworking jobs in another assisted area eligible only for assistance under Article 92(3)(c) does not increase the level of employment and the general standard of living in the Article 92(3)(a) area. Employment increases only in the area where the employee is located and the main impact on regional per capita GDP is felt primarily at the location where the employee spends his income.
It is true that access to skilled manpower can be a crucial factor determining the innovativeness and competitiveness of companies investing in Article 92(3)(a) regions. If such specialists are not available on the local job market and cannot be tempted to move from other areas by the offer of attractive wages, teleworking opportunities are clarly an option for connecting the company to resources that already exist in more developed areas.
However, the main impact this has on regional per capita GDP and on the level of employment would be felt in regions where the teleworker is located, provided there is no serious underemployment, and where he spends his income. This observation forms the basis for the Commission recommendation on promoting teleworking in disadvantaged regions so as to enable employees to offer their services to companies in more developed regions without leaving their place of residence. In this way, the population in disadvantaged regions could be stabilised and regional GDP increased by the teleworker's income(2).
Germany apparently assumes that the authorities in an Article 92(3)(a) region would always expect from the authorities in the region where the job was to be located a contribution towards investment aid reflecting the scale of investment undertaken there.
The provision in question would therefore allow Article 92(3)(c) regions to grant aid for promoting teleworking jobs in their region at an intensity permissible only in Article 92(3)(a) regions. Such an option would, however, diminish the intended incentive effect of the increased level of investment aid in the most disadvantaged regions and could contribute towards a scenario whereby investment would go primarily into jobs for less skilled employees while better skilled employees who, because of their position on the labour market, have no need to move to a less attractive area would remain in more developed regions. As a result, it would mainly be persons earning above average wages and with skills in the engineering, software, management and consultancy sectors who would have no incentive to move to disadvantaged regions and thereby to contribute towards a balanced socio-economic development of those regions.
V
The Commission therefore concludes that the provision of the 26th framework plan of the joint scheme for improving regional economic structures that permits aid intensities for investments in teleworking jobs in excess of the maximum intensity allowed in the region where the relevant job would be located is not compatible with the common market and should not, therefore, be put into effect,","{'title': ""1999/686/EC: Commission Decision of 25 February 1998 concerning aid which Germany intends to grant under the 26th framework plan of the joint scheme for improving regional economic structures with a view to promoting teleworking (26.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/30/EC concerns a legal framework for the roadside inspection of commercial vehicles, whether carrying passengers or freight. It requires Member States to supplement the annual roadworthiness test with unexpected inspections of a representative proportion of the commercial vehicle fleet on their roads each year.
(2) The field of roadworthiness testing is embraced by Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers(2), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/11/EC(3), which covers regular roadworthiness testing, and by Directive 2000/30/EC, which applies to the roadside inspections of heavy commercial vehicles for their roadworthiness. Both Directives use the same Committee and the same procedure for technical adaptations.
(3) Directive 96/96/EC has been amended by the prescription of stricter emission limits for certain categories of motor vehicle and the functional testing of speed limitation devices on heavy commercial vehicles. In order to be consistent with that Directive, Directive 2000/30/EC also needs to be adapted so as to include the new technical provisions, namely by bringing on-board diagnostic (OBD) monitoring systems and speed limiters within the scope of roadside inspections. Directive 2000/30/EC also needs updating (together with Directive 96/96/EC) to incorporate revised emission testing limit values for certain categories of motor vehicles.
(4) The provisions of this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the adaptation to Technical Progress set up pursuant to Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2003/26/EC of 3 April 2003 adapting to technical progress Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards speed limiters and exhaust emissions of commercial vehicles (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnexes I and II to Directive 2000/30/EC are amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2. Visual inspection of any emission control equipment fitted by the manufacturer in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\nAfter a reasonable period of engine conditioning (taking account of manufacturers recommendations) the carbon monoxide (CO) content of the exhaust gases is measured when the engine is idling (no load).\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available or where the Member States competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference value, the CO content must not exceed the following:\n\n(i) for vehicles registered or put into service for the first time between the date from which Member States required the vehicles to comply with directive 70/220/EEC(1) and 1 October 1986: CO - 4,5 % vol.\n\n(ii) for vehicles registered or put into service for the first time after 1 October 1986 - 3,5 % vol.\n\n(b) Where the exhaust emissions are controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter which is lambda-probe controlled:\n\n1. Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2. Visual inspection of any emission control equipment fitted by the manufacturer in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n3. Determination of the efficiency of the vehicles emission control system by measuring the lambda value and the CO content of the exhaust gases in accordance with section 4 or with the procedures proposed by the manufacturers and approved at the time of type-approval. For each of the tests the engine is conditioned in accordance with the vehicle manufacturers recommendations.\n\n4. Exhaust pipe emissions - limit values\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available the CO content must not exceed the following:\n\n(i) Measurement at engine idling speed:\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases must not exceed 0,5 % vol. and for vehicles that have been type-approved according to the limit values shown in row A or row B of the table in section 5.3.1.4 of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC(2) or later amendments the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,3 % vol. Where identification to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC is not possible then the above shall apply to vehicles registered or first put into service after 1 July 2002.\n\n(ii) Measurement at high idle speed (no load), engine speed to be at least 2000 min-1:\n\nCO content: maximum 0,3 % vol. and for vehicles that have been type-approved according to the limit values shown in row A or row B of the table in section 5.3.1.4 of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC or later amendments the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,2 % vol. Where identification to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC is not possible then the above shall apply to vehicles registered or first put into service after 1 July 2002.\n\nLambda: 1± 0,03 or in accordance with the manufacturer\'s specifications.\n\n(iii) For motor vehicles equipped with On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems in accordance with Directive 70/220/EEC (as amended by Directive 98/69/EC and subsequent amendments) Member States may, as an alternative to the test specified in (i), establish the correct functioning of the emission system through the appropriate reading of the OBD device and simultaneous checking of the proper functioning of the OBD system.\n\n2.2. Motor vehicles equipped with compression-ignition (diesel) engines\n\n(a) Exhaust gas opacity to be measured during free acceleration (no load from idle up to cut-off speed) with gear lever in neutral and clutch engaged.\n\n(b) Vehicle preconditioning:\n\n1. Vehicles may be tested without preconditioning although for safety reasons checks should be made that the engine is warm and in a satisfactory mechanical condition.\n\n2. Except as specified in subparagraph (d)(5), no vehicle will be failed unless it has been preconditioned according to the following requirements:\n\n(i) Engine shall be fully warm, for instance the engine oil temperature measured by a probe in the oil level dipstick tube to be at least 80 °C, or normal operating temperature if lower, or the engine block temperature measured by the level of infrared radiation to be at least an equivalent temperature. If, owing to vehicle configuration, this measurement is impractical, the establishment of the engines normal operating temperature may be made by other means, for example by the operation of the engine cooling fan.\n\n(ii) Exhaust system shall be purged by at least three free acceleration cycles or by an equivalent method.\n\n(c) Test procedure:\n\n1. Visual inspection of any emission control equipment fitted by the manufacturer in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2. Engine and any turbocharger fitted, to be at idle before the start of each free acceleration cycle. For heavy-duty diesels, this means waiting for at least 10 seconds after the release of the throttle.\n\n3. To initiate each free acceleration cycle, the throttle pedal must be fully depressed quickly and continuously (in less than one second) but not violently, so as to obtain maximum delivery from the injection pump.\n\n4. During each free acceleration cycle, the engine shall reach cut-off speed or, for vehicles with automatic transmissions, the speed specified by the manufacturer or if this data is not available then two thirds of the cut-off speed, before the throttle is released.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For pyriofenone the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2010/785/EU (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 31 March 2010 an application from ISK BioSciences Europe N.V. for the inclusion of the active substance pyriofenone in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2010/785/EU confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 30 January 2012.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter 'the Authority'). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance pyriofenone (4) on 18 March 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the draft assessment report was finalised on 16 July 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for pyriofenone.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing pyriofenone may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve pyriofenone.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing pyriofenone. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Norway, Austria, Finland and Sweden (1), and in particular Article 149 (1) thereof,
Whereas, in order to avoid the risk of deflection of trade, in relation to the common organization of agricultural markets, due to the accession of the three new States to the European Union, transitional measures must be adopted;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

Whereas Community supplies of certain species of fish or fish fillets currently depend on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interests to suspend in part or in whole the customs duties for the products in question, within Community tariff quotas of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to jeopardize the development prospects of this production in the Community and to ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to open those quotas for the period from 1 April to 30 June 1995, applying customs duties varied accordingly to sensitivity of the different products on the Community market;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up;
Whereas the decision for the opening of autonomous tariff quotas should be taken by the Community; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no reasonable obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota-volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 915/95 of 21 April 1995 opening and providing for the administration of autonomous Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products (1995)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(5) In accordance with Article 24 of Directive 2000/29/EC the Commission shall ascertain whether the introduction of the relevant harmful organism has been caused by inadequate examinations or inspections and adopt the measures required by the findings from its verification.

entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Focaccia di Recco col formaggio (PGI))
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 52(3)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 50(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, Italy's application to register the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2).
(2) Portugal, the United Kingdom and Fresh Gourmet Catering LLC — a company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates — lodged a notice of opposition to the registration pursuant to Article 51(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. The Commission examined the notices of opposition from Portugal and the United Kingdom and found them to be admissible within the meaning of Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012. As Fresh Gourmet Catering LLC was found to lack a legitimate interest, its opposition was considered inadmissible within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the aforementioned Regulation.
(3) The notices of opposition on behalf of two clients (the first based in Portugal and the second in the United Kingdom) of an Italian company located in the geographical area which markets a deep-frozen product, primarily relate to the name and the fact that pre-cooking, deep-freezing and other preservation techniques are prohibited.
(4) By letters of 20 December 2013, the Commission invited Italy and Portugal on the one hand, and Italy and the United Kingdom on the other, to reach an agreement pursuant to Article 51(3) of the aforementioned Regulation. In accordance with that Article, Italy submitted its report concerning the end of the consultation period, by letters dated 15 April 2014. As these Member States were unable to reach an agreement within three months, the Commission was required to settle the matter pursuant to Article 52(3)(b) of the aforementioned Regulation.
(5) The opposing parties cited the legal uncertainty regarding the registration of ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) under Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, given that Italy, by Ministerial Decree of 18 July 2000, last amended on 5 June 2014, registered Focaccia al formaggio di Recco (a different name from that put forward for registration, although it refers to the same product) on its national list of traditional agri-food products. In addition to also existing under the name Focaccia al formaggio di Recco, the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ was not considered traditional given that it first appeared after the year 2000.
(6) Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 does not state that the name of a PGI must be traditional. A name may be registered as a PGI if it is used in trade or in common language, and only in the languages which are or were historically used to describe the specific product in the defined geographical area. Consequently, as it was demonstrated that the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ is used in trade and in common language, in the language of the defined geographical area, its registration as a PGI complies with Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012.
(7) The name Focaccia al formaggio di Recco may not be used for products which do not comply with the specification for the product registered under the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’.
(8) Furthermore, the opposing parties also cited Article 10(1)(c) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 as grounds for opposition, i.e. registration of the name proposed would jeopardise the existence of products legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of publication provided for in Article 50(2)(a) of the aforementioned Regulation. The opposing parties would be prevented from importing and marketing deep-frozen ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ given that pre-cooking, deep-freezing and other preservation techniques are prohibited according to the specification, as stated in point 3.6 of the Single Document.
(9) Nevertheless, the existence of the deep-frozen product bearing the name Focaccia al formaggio di Recco would be jeopardised solely on account of the specification for the proposed ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’, which prohibits pre-cooking, deep-freezing and other preservation techniques. As the processes prohibited under the specification for the proposed name fall within the prerogatives of the applicant group and the content of the specification complies with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, the fact that existing products would allegedly be jeopardised cannot per se prevent the name from being registered.
(10) Furthermore, the Italian Government gave transitional national protection to the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ by Decree of 13 February 2012 of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry Policies. In Italy, this name may only be used for a product made according to the specification included in the application to register the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ sent to the Commission. It would be nonsensical to attribute a transitional period to the opposing parties who import the product and who are established in Portugal and the United Kingdom. In any case, trademarks which were registered or acquired through use in good faith anywhere in the Union prior to the date the application for protection of the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ was submitted to the Commission, may continue to be used and renewed irrespective of the name being registered.
(11) The opposing parties also argued that the specification is in breach of food health standards as regards food preservation. They argue that by prohibiting pre-cooking, deep-freezing, freezing and other preservation techniques, the preservation of the product, and consequently food safety could be compromised. Furthermore, the specification is alleged to contain disproportionate and unlawful standards aiming to regulate the stages following production of the product, even to the extent of dictating how the product should be consumed after sale. In reality, the specification does not contain rules that are in breach of health standards. It is simply the case that if the prohibited preservation processes do have to be used, the product may no longer be sold under the registered name. The specification is in any case subordinate to general EU legislation. As regards the nature and objectives of the rules contained in the specification, they merely set out the characteristics that products under the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ must have when offered for consumption, which relate specifically to how the product bearing the name is produced and in no way affect how the product is consumed once it has been sold.
(12) The opposing parties also claim that prohibiting all forms of preservation unjustifiably restricts the free circulation of a legally-produced product through a rule that is in no way connected to the protection of that product. The product can in fact circulate, albeit not using the name if the product does not comply with the specification. This consequence is justified by the objective of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, namely to protect the names of registered geographical indications.
(13) In the light of the above, the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ should be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Committee,","{'header': '14.1.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 8/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/39\nof 13 January 2015\nentering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Focaccia di Recco col formaggio (PGI))', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 50(2)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012, Italy's application to register the name ‘Focaccia di Recco col formaggio’ was published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2).\n\n((2)) Portugal, the United Kingdom and Fresh Gourmet Catering LLC — a company based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates — lodged a notice of opposition to the registration pursuant to Article 51(1) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01151/2012.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal-by-products not intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 4(2)(e), Article 5(2)(g), Article 6(2)(i) and Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 provides for rules concerning the means of disposal and uses of animal by-products. It also provides for the possibility for additional means of disposal and uses of animal by-products to be approved following consultation of the appropriate scientific committee.
(2) The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) issued an opinion on 10 and 11 April 2003 on six alternative processing methods for safe treatment and disposal of animal by-products. According to that opinion five processes are considered as safe for the disposal of and/or uses of Categories 2 and 3 material under certain conditions.
(3) The SSC issued a final opinion and report on 10 and 11 April 2003 on a treatment of animal waste by means of high temperature and high pressure alkaline hydrolysis, providing guidance on the possibilities to use alkaline hydrolysis and on its risks for the disposal of Categories 1, 2 and 3 material.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued an opinion on 26 and 27 November 2003 on the process of High Pressure Hydrolysis Biogas (HPHB) providing guidance on the possibilities to use this process and on its risks for the disposal of Category 1 material.
(5) Five processes may, therefore, be approved as alternative means for the disposal and/or uses of animal by-products in line with the SSC opinions, in addition to those processing methods already provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. It is also appropriate to lay down the conditions for the use of those processes.
(6) The Commission has asked some of the applicants for approval of the processes to submit further information regarding the safety of their processes for the treatment and disposal of Category 1 material. That information is to be forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority for evaluation in due course.
(7) Pending that evaluation, and considering current SSC opinions that tallow is safe as regards TSE, especially if it is pressure-cooked and filtered to remove insoluble impurities, it is appropriate to approve one of the processes, which processes animal fat into biodiesel, also for treatment and disposal, under strict conditions, of most Category 1 material, except for the most risky. In that case, it should be made clear that the treatment and disposal may include the recovery of bioenergy.
(8) The approval and the operation of such alternative means should be without prejudice to other applicable EU legislation, in particular environmental legislation, and therefore the operating conditions established in this Regulation should, where applicable, be implemented according to Article 6 paragraph 4 of Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 (2) on the incineration of waste.
(9) For processes approved for the treatment of Category 1 animal by-products, and as a surveillance measure complementary to the regular monitoring of processing parameters, the efficacy of the process, together with its safety with regard to animal and public health, should be demonstrated to the competent authorities by testing in a pilot plant during the first two years following the implementation of the process within each Member State concerned.
(10) It is appropriate to amend Annex VI, Chapters II and III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 as a consequence of approving the transformation of Category 1 animal by-products.

It also provides for the possibility for additional means of disposal and uses of animal by-products to be approved following consultation of the appropriate scientific committee.\n\n((2)) The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) issued an opinion on 10 and 11 April 2003 on six alternative processing methods for safe treatment and disposal of animal by-products. According to that opinion five processes are considered as safe for the disposal of and/or uses of Categories 2 and 3 material under certain conditions.\n\n((3)) The SSC issued a final opinion and report on 10 and 11 April 2003 on a treatment of animal waste by means of high temperature and high pressure alkaline hydrolysis, providing guidance on the possibilities to use alkaline hydrolysis and on its risks for the disposal of Categories 1, 2 and 3 material.\n\n((4)) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued an opinion on 26 and 27 November 2003 on the process of High Pressure Hydrolysis Biogas (HPHB) providing guidance on the possibilities to use this process and on its risks for the disposal of Category 1 material.\n\n((5)) Five processes may, therefore, be approved as alternative means for the disposal and/or uses of animal by-products in line with the SSC opinions, in addition to those processing methods already provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002. It is also appropriate to lay down the conditions for the use of those processes.\n\n((6)) The Commission has asked some of the applicants for approval of the processes to submit further information regarding the safety of their processes for the treatment and disposal of Category 1 material. That information is to be forwarded to the European Food Safety Authority for evaluation in due course.\n\n((7)) Pending that evaluation, and considering current SSC opinions that tallow is safe as regards TSE, especially if it is pressure-cooked and filtered to remove insoluble impurities, it is appropriate to approve one of the processes, which processes animal fat into biodiesel, also for treatment and disposal, under strict conditions, of most Category 1 material, except for the most risky. In that case, it should be made clear that the treatment and disposal may include the recovery of bioenergy.\n\n((8)) The approval and the operation of such alternative means should be without prejudice to other applicable EU legislation, in particular environmental legislation, and therefore the operating conditions established in this Regulation should, where applicable, be implemented according to Article 6 paragraph 4 of Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000(2)on the incineration of waste.\n\n((9)) For processes approved for the treatment of Category 1 animal by-products, and as a surveillance measure complementary to the regular monitoring of processing parameters, the efficacy of the process, together with its safety with regard to animal and public health, should be demonstrated to the competent authorities by testing in a pilot plant during the first two years following the implementation of the process within each Member State concerned.\n\n((10)) It is appropriate to amend Annex VI, Chapters II and III of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 as a consequence of approving the transformation of Category 1 animal by-products.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Treatment and disposal of Category 1 material', 'text': 'Article 1\nTreatment and disposal of Category 1 material\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The processes of alkaline hydrolysis as defined in Annex I and of high pressure hydrolysis biogas as defined in Annex III are approved and may be authorised by the competent authority for the treatment and disposal of Category 1 material.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The process of biodiesel production as defined in Annex IV is approved and may be authorised by the competent authority for the treatment and disposal of Category 1 material, except for material referred to in Article 4(1)(a)(i) and (ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.\nHowever, material derived from animals referred to in Article 4(1)(a)(ii) may be used for this process provided that:\n(a)\nthe animals were below 24 months of age at the time they were killed; or\n(b)\nthe animals were subjected to laboratory testing for the presence of a TSE pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(\n3\n)\nand the result of the testing was negative.\nThe competent authority may also authorise this process for the treatment and disposal of any Category 1 processed animal fat.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Treatment and use or disposal of Categories 2 or 3 material', 'text': 'Article 2\nTreatment and use or disposal of Categories 2 or 3 material\nThe processes of alkaline hydrolysis, high pressure high temperature hydrolysis, high pressure hydrolysis biogas, biodiesel production and Brookes gasification as defined in Annexes I to V respectively are approved and may be authorised by the competent authority for the treatment and use or disposal of Categories 2 or 3 material.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Conditions for implementing the processes defined in Annexes I to V', 'text': 'Article 3\nConditions for implementing the processes defined in Annexes I to V\nThe competent authority shall approve the plants which use one of the processes described in Annexes I to V once it has authorised the process, if the plant complies with the technical specifications and parameters in the relevant Annex, and with the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, except for the technical specifications and parameters laid down in that Regulation for other processes.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organization  of the market in fishery and aquaculture products  (1), and in particular Article 12 (6) thereof,
Whereas under Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 Member States are to grant financial  compensation to producers' organizations which, observing certain requirements, withdraw from the  market products listed in Annex I (A) and (D) of that Regulation;
Whereas, in order to give maximum encouragement to action to stabilize the market, producers'  organizations not observing the Community withdrawal price throughout the fishing year should be  debarred from receiving financial compensation;
Whereas in order to guarantee normal conditions of competition between producers' organizations  making use of the margin of tolerance provided for at (a) in Article 12 (1) of the abovementioned  Regulation it is necessary to specify requirements pertaining to its application; whereas in order  to ensure transparency of the market recourse to the margin of tolerance must be adequately  publicized;
Whereas the purpose of the activities of producers' organizations is to ensure rationality of  fishing operations and improve selling conditions for their members' catches; whereas it is  accordingly necessary to restrict financial compensation to fish caught by members of such  organizations;
Whereas since demand may fluctuate within the duration of any selling operation products should not  be withdrawn from the market before being put up for sale; whereas compensation should accordingly  be granted only on products that, having been put up for sale in the normal way, have not found a  buyer at the Community withdrawal price;
Whereas compensation must be clearly disallowed on fish on which the carryover aid provided for in  Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 has been granted;
Whereas systematic compliance with common marketing standards as indicated in Article 2 of  Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 is, irrespective of their obligatory character, a determining factor in  price formation and a contributory element to stabilization of the market; whereas the granting of  compensation on eligible quantities should therefore be made conditional on compliance with the  standards for all quantities of the product in question put up for sale by the producers'  organization or its members throughout the fishing year;
Whereas financial compensation cannot be paid until the end of the fishing year; whereas to  facilitate the operation of producers' organizations it should be made possible for advances to be  granted against lodging of security;
Whereas rules for calculating advances on financial compensation and fixing the security amount  required should be set; whereas the conversion rate for the compensation and for advances must also  be set;
Whereas the granting of compensation should extend to fish put up for sale and withdrawn by  producers' organizations or their members in other Member States; whereas the authorities of the  other Member State in which the fish was put up for sale and withdrawn or carried over should issue  a certifying document and transmit a copy;
Whereas each Member State should introduce a control system for verifying that the figures given in  applications for financial compensation correspond to the quantities actually put up for sale and  withdrawn;
Whereas in cases of infringement of limited consequence of the financial compensation scheme the  producers' organization should not, for the restricted financial advantage arising from the  infringement, be penalized by complete withdrawal of entitlement to financial compensation but  merely by a flat rate reduction therein;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Fishery Products,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3902/92 of 23 December 1992 setting detailed rules for granting financial compensation on certain fishery products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThis Regulation lays down detailed rules  for granting the financial compensation referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92,  hereinafter referred to as the 'basic Regulation`.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 131 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 introduces restrictions to the placing on the market and use of Diphenylether, pentabromo derivative and perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS) under entries 44 and 53.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC (2) implements in Union law the commitments set out in the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, hereinafter ‘the Convention’, approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC (3) and in the 1998 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants, hereinafter ‘the Protocol’, approved by Council Decision 2004/259/EC (4).
(3) Following nominations of substances received from the European Union and its Member States, Norway and Mexico, the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee established under the Convention has concluded its work on a group of substances that have been found to meet the criteria of the Convention. At the fourth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on 4-8 May 2009, (hereinafter ‘the COP 4’), it was agreed to add nine substances to the Annexes to the Convention including Pentabromodiphenyl ether and PFOS.
(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 757/2010 of 24 August 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants as regards Annexes I and III (5) implements the Decisions of the COP 4, by including the substances listed in the Convention or the Protocol or in both in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. Those substances include Pentabromodiphenyl ether and PFOS. Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 prohibits the production and placing on the market of the substances listed in Annex I and regulates the management of waste containing these substances.

","COUNCIL DECISION
of 31 January 2000
concerning the conclusion of the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (""Parallel Agreement"")
(2000/125/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Articles 95 and 133 thereof, in conjunction with Article 300(2), first sentence, and Article 300(3) second subparagraph thereof;
Having regard to the proposal by the Commission(1);
Having received the assent of the European Parliament(2);
Whereas:
(1) In its Decision of 3 November 1997, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate in the framework of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) an Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (""Parallel Agreement"").
(2) As a result of those negotiations, on 25 June 1998 the Parallel Agreement was opened for signature; the Community signed that Agreement on 18 October 1999.
(3) International harmonisation in the automotive sector is already taking place in the framework of the 1958 UN/ECE Revised Agreement concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (the 1958 Agreement), to which the Community became a Contracting Party on 24 March 1998.
(4) Conclusion of the Parallel Agreement constitutes an aim of common trade policy in accordance with Article 133 of the Treaty to remove existing and avoid the creation of new technical barriers to trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties; involvement by the Community will ensure consistency between the harmonisation activites conducted under both the 1958 Agreement and the Parallel Agreement and will thus permit easier access to third-country markets.
(5) Conclusion of the Parallel Agreement by the Community establishes a specific institutinal framework by organising cooperation procedures between Contracting Parties; the assent of the European Parliament is therefore required.
(6) It is necessary to establish practical arrangements with regard to the involvement of the Community in the Parallel Agreement.
(7) The Commission should be responsible for meeting all the notification requirements laid down in the Parallel Agreement; the Parallel Agreement is to operate in parallel with the 1958 Agreement; both Agreements will operate in the framework of the UN/ECE and use the same Working Parties and facilities installed in that framework.
(8) The Parallel Agreement creates a framework to establish global technical regulations in the global registry by consensus vote; due to the operating in parallel of the two Agreements, draft technical regulations emerging from the Working Groups will in principle be voted in the bodies under both Agreements; for the 1958 Agreement a decision-making procedure has been established; the Community vote concerning the Parallel Agreement can therefore be decided upon under the same procedure on the same occasion as for the 1958 Agreement.
(9) In cases where a regulation is only voted under the Parallel Agreement, it is possible to delegate the decision determining the Community vote to the Commission assisted by the regulatory committee, because the established global technical regulation has at a later stage to be submitted for adoption to the procedure laid down in Articles 95 and 251 of the Treaty.
(10) The Community vote regarding a proposed amendment to the Parallel Agreement should be determined in accordance with the procedure followed in order to approve that Agreement; with regard to the expression of an objection to an amendment to the Parallel Agreement after a consensus vote in favour of the amendment, taking account of the time constrains laid down in that Agreement, the Community position may be decided upon by the Commission in a less complex procedure.
(11) The Parallel Agreement should be approved,","{'title': ""2000/125/EC: Council Decision of 31 January 2000 concerning the conclusion of the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles ('Parallel Agreement')"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles, hereinafter referred to as the ""Parallel Agreement"", is hereby approved on behalf of the Community, within the limits of its competences.\n\nThe text of the Parallel Agreement is set out as Annex I.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe President of the Council shall be authorised to designate the person empowered to lodge the instrument of approval as required by Article 9.2 of the Parallel Agreement and to make the declaration contained in Annex II.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe Commission shall carry out on behalf of the Community all the notifications laid down in the Parallel Agreement, in particular those provided for under its Articles 7,9,12 and 15.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe principal arrangements with regard to the participation of the Community and the Member States in the Parallel Agreement are established in Annex III.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': ""Article 5\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 30(1)(a), (b) and (c), Article 30(2)(c) and Article 34(2)(c) thereof,
Having regard to the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) At its meeting of 3 December 1998 the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers adopted the Action Plan of the Council and the Commission on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice(3), measure 48 of which states that, within five years of the Treaty's entering into force, action should be taken to promote cooperation and joint initiatives in training, the exchange of liaison officers, secondment, the use of equipment and forensic research.
(2) At its meeting in Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998 the European Council endorsed, in its conclusion 83, the Council and Commission Action Plan on how best to implement the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on an area of freedom, security and justice, and in its conclusion 89 it called for a strengthening of action against organised crime in the light of the new possibilities opened up by the Treaty.
(3) At its meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 the European Council invited the Council and the Commission, in close cooperation with the European Parliament, to promote the full and immediate implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam, on the basis of the Action Plan adopted on 3 December 1998 by the Council of Home Affairs Ministers and endorsed at the meeting of the European Council in Vienna on 11 and 12 December 1998 and of the political guidelines and concrete objectives involving a deepening of police cooperation for the purpose of combating cross-border crime which were agreed in Tampere.
(4) At its meeting in Helsinki on 10 and 11 December 1999, the European Council urged the European Union to intensify its efforts at the international level by stepping up cooperation with third countries in reducing the demand for and supply of drugs, and on justice and home affairs. The European Council also noted that there would be a need for combined efforts by all the relevant authorities, with a particular role for Europol.
(5) At its meeting in Laeken on 14 and 15 December 2001 the European Council confirmed, in its conclusion 37, the guidelines and objectives defined at Tampere and also noted that there was a need for new impetus and guidelines to make good delays in some areas.
(6) On 14 October 1996 the Council adopted Joint Action 96/602/JHA providing for a common framework for the initiatives of the Member States concerning liaison officers(4).
(7) In the light of experience in applying the Joint Action and in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam on combating cross-border crime, cooperation amongst Member States on the tasks assigned to, and the posting of liaison officers to third countries and international organisations needs to be strengthened and developed.
(8) Insofar as is relevant for performing the tasks defined in the Europol Convention(5), Europol will establish and maintain cooperative relations with third countries and international organisations.
(9) Europol has established and will continue to establish and maintain cooperative relations with a wide range of third countries and international organisations.
(10) Europol needs to be given the necessary support and means to function effectively as the focal point of European police cooperation. The European Council has stressed that Europol plays a central role in cooperation between the authorities of the Member States in investigating cross-border crime by supporting the prevention, analysis and investigation of crime at Union level.
(11) Europol needs to be given the opportunity to make use to some extent of Member States' liaison officers in third countries, so as to strengthen Europol's operative support function in relation to national police authorities.
(12) Member States recognise that extensive cooperation is already taking place between liaison officers posted by Member States in view of their national needs to third countries and international organisations. However, there is a need to strengthen some aspects of cooperation between those liaison officers, to make the best possible use of Member States' resources.
(13) Cooperation between Member States in this area needs to be strengthened so as to facilitate the exchange of information with a view to combating serious cross-border crime.
(14) Member States attach particular weight to cooperation in combating cross-border crime, as they believe that strengthening cooperation regarding the exchange of information will enhance the national authorities' capabilities to combat crime effectively. Member States believe that Europol should play a central role in this.
(15) The aim of this Decision is to regulate questions relating to the fight against serious cross-border crime.
(16) The provisions in the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders(6) (hereinafter ""Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement"") which relates to the common use of liaison officers should be developed further, with a view to strengthening cooperation between Member States in the fight against cross-border crime.
(17) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Decision constitutes, with the exception of Article 8, a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(7), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1(H) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC(8) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(18) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Decision in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(9).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine.
(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For bifenox the rapporteur Member State was Belgium and all relevant information was submitted on 4 July 2005. For diflufenican the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 1 August 2005. For fenoxaprop-P the rapporteur Member State was Austria and all relevant information was submitted on 2 May 2005. For fenpropidin and quinoclamine the rapporteur Member State was Sweden and all relevant information was submitted on 24 June 2005 and 15 June 2005 respectively.
(3) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 November 2007 for quinoclamine, on 29 November 2007 for bifenox and fenoxaprop-P and on 17 December 2007 for diflufenican and fenpropidin in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports (4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 14 March 2008 in the format of the Commission review reports for bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine.
(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that bifenox should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for consumers and the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals and that fenpropidin should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for the long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and such studies should be presented by the notifiers.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.7.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 171/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2008/66/EC\nof 30 June 2008\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine as active substances\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine.\n\n((2)) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For bifenox the rapporteur Member State was Belgium and all relevant information was submitted on 4 July 2005. For diflufenican the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 1 August 2005. For fenoxaprop-P the rapporteur Member State was Austria and all relevant information was submitted on 2 May 2005. For fenpropidin and quinoclamine the rapporteur Member State was Sweden and all relevant information was submitted on 24 June 2005 and 15 June 2005 respectively.\n\n((3)) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 November 2007 for quinoclamine, on 29 November 2007 for bifenox and fenoxaprop-P and on 17 December 2007 for diflufenican and fenpropidin in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports(4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 14 March 2008 in the format of the Commission review reports for bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine.\n\n((4)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n\n((5)) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that bifenox should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for consumers and the long-term risk to herbivorous mammals and that fenpropidin should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for the long-term risk to herbivorous and insectivorous birds and such studies should be presented by the notifiers.\n\n((6)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n\n((7)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing bifenox, diflufenican, fenoxaprop-P, fenpropidin and quinoclamine to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((8)) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex\xa0I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n\n((9)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall adopt and publish by 30 June 2009 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

(4) An agreement has been reached between the European Community and Norway whereby 15000 tonnes of sand eel in Community waters of ICES Sub-division IIa and the North Sea has been transferred to Norway and 1500 tonnes of plaice in the same area has been transferred from Norway to the Community.
(5) The TAC for herring in ICES Sub-divisions VIIg,h,j,k should be set for the whole year 2002 taking into account new scientific advice from ICES.
(6) Following the judgment of the Court of Justice of 18 April 2002 in case C-61/96 footnote 2 on the entry concerning anchovy in Zone IX, X, CECAF 34.1.1 should be deleted.
(7) During the Annual Meeting of the International Committee for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) from 12 to 19 November 2001, tables were adopted for the first time showing the under-utilisation and over-utilisation by the ICCAT Contracting Parties of their fishing possibilities agreed in ICCAT. In this context, ICCAT adopted a decision showing that during 2000, the European Community under-exploited its quota by 1696 tonnes for South Atlantic blue-fin tuna and by two tonnes for South Atlantic swordfish as well as over-exploited its quota of North Atlantic swordfish by 147,5 tonnes.
(8) In order to respect the adjustments to the Community quotas established by ICCAT, and taking into account the under-utilisation and the over-utilisation attributed to the European Community resulting from the under-exploitation of South Atlantic blue-fin tuna and swordfish and the over-exploitation by certain Member States of the 2000 fishing possibilities of North Atlantic swordfish established by ICCAT, it is necessary that the distribution of under-utilisation and over-utilisation is carried out on the basis of the respective contribution of each Member State towards the under-utilisation and over-utilisation without modifying the distribution key established under Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001(2) concerning the annual allocation of TACs.
(9) In accordance with Article 10 (1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 973/2001 of 14 May 2001 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species(3) the number of Community fishing vessels that are fishing for northern albacore as a target species should be determined, based on the average number of fishing vessels fishing for this species during the period 1993 and 1995. That number of vessels should be distributed among the Member States.
(10) At its extraordinary meeting in November 2000, ICCAT recommended that quotas should be introduced for white marlin and blue marlin in the Atlantic Ocean.
(11) The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission (IBSFC), recommended technical conservation measures in March 2001 for the cod trawl fishery. Therefore, point 3 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 should be changed.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1811/2002 of 24 September 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 2555/2001 fixing for 2002 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where limitations in catch are required', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 2555/2001 is amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas exceptional measures to support the market in pigmeat were adopted for the Netherlands by Commission Regulation (EC) No 413/97 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 670/97 (4), in response to the outbreak of classical swine fever in certain production regions in that country;
Whereas the swift and effective implementation of the exceptional support measures has come up against problems of capacity in the rendering plants which are to process the piglets; whereas it is therefore appropriate to increase temporarily the average weight of the eligible piglets and to allow their slaughtering and their storage in cold stores;
Whereas it is necessary to adjust the aid granted for the delivery of young piglets to the present market situation taking into account the increase in market prices;
Whereas because of the duration of the veterinary and commercial restrictions imposed by the Dutch veterinary authorities and the enlargement of these restrictions to new zones it is necessary to increase the number of fattened pigs, piglets and young piglets which may be delivered to the competent authorities in order to allow the continuation of the exceptional support measures in the coming weeks;
Whereas it is necessary to include the protection and surveillance zones around Ammerzoden and Nederweert in the exceptional measures by replacing Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 413/97 by a new Annex;
Whereas it is appropriate, on the basis of the gained experience, to allow more flexibility in the conditions regarding the storage of the slaughtered animals laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 413/97;
Whereas the fast and efficient application of exceptional market support measures is one of the best instruments to combat the spread of classical swine fever; whereas it is justified from then on to apply the provisions laid down in Article 1 point 6 of this Regulation with effect from 27 March 1997 and the other provisions with effect from 16 April 1997;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) sets maximum levels for aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin total (aflatoxin B1 + G1 + B2 + G2) in a range of foodstuffs.
(2) It is necessary to amend certain maximum levels for aflatoxins in certain foodstuffs to take into account developments in Codex Alimentarius and new information contained in recent scientific advice.
(3) Codex Alimentarius established a level of 15 μg/kg aflatoxin total in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios intended for further processing and a level of 10 μg/kg aflatoxin total in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios ‘ready-to-eat’ (3).
(4) The Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (Contam Panel) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted on 25 January 2007 an opinion on the potential increase of consumer health risk by a possible increase of the existing maximum levels for aflatoxins in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios and derived products (4). The Contam Panel concluded that changing the maximum levels for total aflatoxins from 4 to 8 or 10 μg/kg in almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios would have minor effects on the estimates of dietary exposure, cancer risk and the calculated margins of exposure (MOEs). The Panel furthermore concluded that exposure to aflatoxins from all sources should be as low as reasonably achievable, because aflatoxins are genotoxic and carcinogenic. The data indicate that reduction of total dietary exposure to aflatoxins could be achieved by reducing the number of highly contaminated foods reaching the market through more effective enforcement and reducing exposure from food sources other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios.
(5) The Contam Panel adopted on 16 June 2009 a statement on the effects on public health of an increase of the levels for aflatoxin total from 4 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg for tree nuts other than almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios (5). The Panel concluded that based on the information which was available in 2007 public health would not be adversely affected by increasing the levels for total aflatoxins from 4 μg/kg to 10 μg/kg for other tree nuts, including Brazil nuts. Given the current discussions in Codex Alimentarius on the maximum levels for aflatoxins in Brazil nuts, it is appropriate to align the level for aflatoxins in Brazil nuts with the Codex level for almonds, hazelnuts and pistachios.
(6) Codex Alimentarius established only a maximum level for aflatoxin total. The corresponding aflatoxin B1 level was determined by making use of the database on occurrence of aflatoxins in food used by EFSA for the exposure assessment.
(7) In the EFSA opinion on aflatoxins it is observed that oilseeds and derived products are an important contributor to the human aflatoxin exposure. EFSA concluded that exposure to aflatoxins from all sources should be as low as reasonably achievable. Furthermore, notifications in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) indicate high levels of aflatoxins in oilseeds such as sunflower seeds, melon seeds etc. It is therefore proposed to also set a maximum level for oilseeds other than groundnuts (peanuts), in line with the existing maximum levels for groundnuts (peanuts). However, as aflatoxins are nearly completely removed by the process for producing refined vegetable oils, it is appropriate to exclude oilseeds, including groundnuts (peanuts), intended for crushing for refined vegetable oil and refined vegetable oil.
(8) A maximum level of 2 μg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 4 μg/kg aflatoxin total has been established in all cereals and all products derived from cereals with the exception of maize to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption for which a maximum level of 5 μg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 10 μg/kg for aflatoxin total has been established. Rice in husk regularly contains levels of aflatoxins slightly above the maximum levels. After milling, a process which removes the husk, the levels of aflatoxins in the white milled rice are below the maximum levels. It is therefore appropriate to apply the same approach for rice as the existing approach for maize, and to set a higher maximum level of aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin total for rice to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.
(9) The maximum levels refer to the edible part of the tree nuts. However, recent scientific evidence has demonstrated that a part of the aflatoxin contamination can be found on the shell of Brazil nuts. Therefore, it is appropriate to modify the footnote in the Annex, indicating the procedure to be followed in case tree nuts ‘in shell’ are analysed, to take into account this recent scientific information.

However, as aflatoxins are nearly completely removed by the process for producing refined vegetable oils, it is appropriate to exclude oilseeds, including groundnuts (peanuts), intended for crushing for refined vegetable oil and refined vegetable oil.\n\n((8)) A maximum level of 2\xa0μg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 4\xa0μg/kg aflatoxin total has been established in all cereals and all products derived from cereals with the exception of maize to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption for which a maximum level of 5\xa0μg/kg for aflatoxin B1 and 10\xa0μg/kg for aflatoxin total has been established. Rice in husk regularly contains levels of aflatoxins slightly above the maximum levels. After milling, a process which removes the husk, the levels of aflatoxins in the white milled rice are below the maximum levels. It is therefore appropriate to apply the same approach for rice as the existing approach for maize, and to set a higher maximum level of aflatoxin B1 and aflatoxin total for rice to be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs.\n\n((9)) The maximum levels refer to the edible part of the tree nuts. However, recent scientific evidence has demonstrated that a part of the aflatoxin contamination can be found on the shell of Brazil nuts. Therefore, it is appropriate to modify the footnote in the Annex, indicating the procedure to be followed in case tree nuts ‘in shell’ are analysed, to take into account this recent scientific information.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Specific provisions for groundnut, other oilseeds, tree nuts, dried fruit, rice and maize', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1881/2006 is amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 4 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 4\nSpecific provisions for groundnut, other oilseeds, tree nuts, dried fruit, rice and maize\nGroundnuts (peanuts), other oilseeds, tree nuts, dried fruit, rice and maize not complying with the appropriate maximum levels of aflatoxins laid down in points 2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.1.7, 2.1.8, 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 of the Annex can be placed on the market provided that these foodstuffs:\n(a)\nare not intended for direct human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs;\n(b)\ncomply with the appropriate maximum levels laid down in points 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.9 and 2.1.12 of the Annex;\n(c)\nare subjected to a treatment involving sorting or other physical treatment and that after this treatment the maximum levels laid down in points 2.1.5, 2.1.6, 2.1.7, 2.1.8, 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 of the Annex are not exceeded, and this treatment does not result in other harmful residues;\n(d)\nare labelled clearly showing their use, and bearing the indication “product shall be subjected to sorting or other physical treatment to reduce aflatoxin contamination before human consumption or use as an ingredient in foodstuffs”.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53 (1) (b)(ii) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Union emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect public health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(2) Following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station on 11 March 2011, the Commission was informed that radionuclide levels in certain food products originating in Japan such as milk and spinach exceeded the action levels in food applicable in Japan. Such contamination may constitute a threat to public and animal health in the Union and therefore Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 imposing special conditions governing the import of feed and food originating in or consigned from Japan following the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station (2) was adopted.
(3) On 14 June 2011, the Commission was informed of the finding of a high level of radioactive caesium in green tea leaves, originating in the Shizuoka prefecture. That was confirmed on 15 June 2011 by five other findings of high level of radioactive caesium in green tea leaves from Shizuoka prefecture. That prefecture is not among the prefectures of the affected zone, where a testing of all feed and food originating from those prefectures is required before export to the Union. Given these recent findings it is appropriate to add Shizuoka prefecture to the affected zone.
(4) A significant number of samples taken by the Japanese authorities from food produced in Niigata and Yamagata prefectures show that the production of feed and food in those prefectures is only to a very limited extent affected by the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station as none of the samples had non-compliant levels of radioactivity, nearly all samples had non-detectable levels of radioactivity and only in few samples low levels of radioactivity were detected. Therefore, it is appropriate to remove those prefectures from the zone, where a testing of all feed and food originating from those prefectures is required before export to the Union.
(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Regulation (EU) No 297/2011 accordingly, whilst keeping the date of applicability of the Regulation unchanged.

Whereas the present situation on the Community market for seeds listed in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 and which will be marketed during the 1988/89 and 1989/90 marketing years and its foreseeable development do not ensure a fair income for  producers; whereas part of the production costs should therefore be offset by the granting of aid;
Whereas Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 provides that the aid shall be fixed, taking into account, on the one hand, the need to ensure a balance between the volume of production required in the Community and the possible outlets for that  production and, on the other hand, the prices of the products on external markets;
Whereas Articles 106 and 300 of the Act of Accession stipulate that the aid for seeds is to be granted in Spain and Portugal in accordance with Articles 79 and 246 of the said Act;

terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain ceramic tiles originating in Spain
(84/334/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 20 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In August 1983 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Groupement des Producteurs de Carreaux CĂŠramiques du MarchĂŠ Commun on behalf of producers of glazed ceramic wall tiles whose collective output constitutes substantially all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of glazed ceramic wall tiles into the Community falling within Common Customs Tariff subheading ex 69.08 B II and corresponding to NIMEXE codes 69.08-85 and 69.08-99 originating in Spain and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
The majority of the known exporters, some importers and some producers made their views known in writing.
(3) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a determination regarding dumping and injury and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
(a) EEC producers
Mosa BV, Maastricht, Netherlands,
NV Koninklijke Sphinx, Maastricht, Netherlands,
Marazzi Ceramiche SPA, Sassuolo, Italy,
Pilkington's Tiles Ltd, Manchester, United Kingdom,
H & R Johnson Tiles Ltd, Stoke on Trent, United Kingdom,
Eliki Ceramic Tiles SA, Athens, Greece,
Philkerham Johnson SA, Thessaloniki, Greece,
Villeroy & Boch, Mettlach, Federal Republic of Germany,
Agrob Wessel Servais, Alfter Witterschlik, Federal Republic of Germany.
(b) Exporters
Fabresa, Lucena Del Cid, Castellon,
Symfa SA, Onda, Castellon,
Azulejera la Plana SA, Villarreal, Castellon,
Ceramica Azuleu, Juan Domingo SA, Onda, Castellon.
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from the majority of exporters, some importers and some complainant Community producers and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary. The investigation relating to Spanish exporters covered approximately 65 % of exports of the product concerned to the Community during the reference period. The investigation of dumping covered 1983.
B. Normal value
(4) The complaint alleged dumping on the basis of a comparison of export prices of the Spanish producers and a constructed normal value. This normal value was based on Italian producers' costs, which were considered, particularly as regards raw material and labour costs, to be similar to those in Spain.
The investigation revealed, however, that all the Spanish producers concerned had significant sales of the product on the domestic market. These sales were considered in every case to be representative enough to be the basis for establishing normal value.
(5) Normal value was accordingly determined for all but two of the exporting companies concerned on the basis of domestic prices of these companies. For the remaining exporting companies, both of which had been selling the products concerned throughout the reference period at a loss on the domestic market, normal value was determined by computing a constructed value on the basis of the companies' total cost of materials and manufacture, including overheads, and adding a profit margin of 5 % considered to be reasonable in the light of the information available on the Spanish industry's performance.
C. Export price
(6) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid for the products sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(7) In comparing normal values with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. In the two cases where domestic sales were made at a loss the comparison was made between the constructed normal value and their export prices. Where a difference in the physical characteristics of the product was established due account was taken. These differences were in size, colour or pattern. Allowance was also made, where appropriate, for differences in conditions and terms of sale and for the incidence of cumulative indirect taxes.
All comparisons were made at ex-works level.
E. Margins
(8) The above examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of four Spanish exporters, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
These margins vary according to the exporter, the importing market and the type of product concerned. The weighted average margin for each of these exporters is, however, less than 0,5 % and is accordingly considered to be de minimis.
For the remaining Spanish exporters the investigation established that the prices for export to the Community were not less than the normal values.
F. Termination
(9) In these circumstances the procedure concerning imports of glazed ceramic wall tiles originating in Spain should be terminated,",{'title': '84/334/EEC: Commission Decision of 26 June 1984 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain ceramic tiles originating in Spain'}

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3642/93 of 20 December 1993 on certain rules for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community of the one  part, and the Republic of Bulgaria of the other part (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3642/93 of 20 December 1993 on certain rules for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community of the one  part, and Romania, of the other part (2), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in eggs (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1574/93 (4), and in particular Article 15 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1574/93, and in particulart Article 15 thereof,
Whereas the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the Community and the Republic of Bulgaria (6), signed in Brussels on 8 March 1993, entered into force on 31 December 1993; whereas the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related  matters between the Community and Romania (7), signed in Brussels on 1 February 1993, entered into force on 1 May 1993; whereas the said Agreements provide for a reduction in the import levy for some products of the poultrymeat and egg sectors within  certain quantity limits; whereas it is necessary therefore to lay down certain detailed rules of application in this respect;
Whereas the measures to be adopted for applying the Interim Agreements laid down in this Regulation should take effect on 1 January 1994; whereas they should however, be limited initially to the first two quarters of 1994 in order to take account of the  Additional Protocols to the Interim Agreements which have been signed between the Community and the two abovementioned countries and pending clarification of certain other factors relating to the exact timing of the introduction of the Community  concessions;
Whereas, while bearing in mind the provisions of the Interim Agreements intended to guarantee the origin of the product, provision should be made for the administration of the said arrangements to be guaranteed by import licences for the majority of the  products; whereas, to that end, the detailed rules for submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, by derogation from Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988  laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agriculture products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3519/93 (9), should be laid down; whereas, in addition,  provision should be made for the certificates and licences to be issued after a period of consideration, applying, where necessary, a single percentage reduction;
Whereas, in order to ensure proper administration of the system, the guarantee for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 90 per 100 kg; whereas, in view of the likelihood of speculation inherent in the system in the egg and  poultrymeat sectors, precise conditions governing access by operators to the said system should be laid down;
Whereas, for live geese, whole geese or geese cut in pieces, it is possible to replace the system of import licences with a system for monitoring quantities actually imported which is less restrictive for importers;
Whereas, in the case of those products, equal and continuous access to the quantities subject to a reduced levy should be ensured for all Community importers, and the levy should be applied consistently until the quantities are exhausted; whereas the  necessary measures should be taken to ensure efficient Community administration of those quantities by providing the opportunity to draw from the volume of those quantities on the basis of actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires  close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Poultrymeat and Eggs,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 374/94 of 18 February 1994 laying down detailed rules for the application in the poultrymeat and egg sectors of the arrangements provided for the Interim Agreements between the Community, of the one part and Bulgaria and Romania, of the other part', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAll imports into the Community under the arrangements provided for in Article 15 (2) and (4) of the Interim Agreements of products in groups 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43 and 44 referred to in Annex I to this Regulation, shall be subject to the  presentation of an import licence.\n\nThe quantities of products to which those arrangements apply and the rates of reduction in the levies on the rate of customs duty shall be those listed by group in Annex I.\n\nSubject to the provisions of Article 2, the rate of reduction in the levy, or the rate of customs duty shall be that in force during the period in which applications for import licences are submitted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the period from 1 January to 30 June 1994, the quantities fixed for the groups referred to in Article 1 shall be allocated in two equal tranches of 50 % during the two quarters commencing on 1 January and 1 April respectively.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe import licences referred to in Article 1 shall be subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) applicants for import licences must be natural or legal persons who, at the time at which applications are submitted, can prove to the satisfaction of the competent authorities in the Member States that they have imported or exported not less than  25 tonnes (product weight) in the case of products falling within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 and five tonnes (egg in shell equivalent) in the case of products falling within the scope of Council Regulations (EEC) No 2771/75 and (EEC) No  2783/75 (10) in 1992 and between 1 January and 30 November 1993; however, retail establishments and restaurants selling these products to final consumers shall not be eligible for this scheme;\n\n(b) the licence application may involve only one of groups 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 43 and 44 referred to in Annex I to this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Articles 134 and 148 thereof in conjunction with Article 4,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Chapter II of Commission Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 (2), applications for ‘A’ licence have to be submitted in April, July, October and January of each year, and ‘A’ licences are only valid for the subperiod for which they have been issued.
(2) According to an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Argentine Republic pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 for the modification of concessions with respect to garlic provided for in Schedule CXL annexed to the GATT (3), approved by Council Decision 2001/404/EC (4), the import tariff quota period for garlic should be divided into four subperiods.
(3) In order to provide importers with more flexibility, the period in which they may lodge applications for ‘A’ licences should begin six weeks earlier.
(4) In order to ensure that as much unused or partly used import licences as possible may be reallocated, the quantities, including nil returns, covered by unused or partly used import licences and corresponding to the difference between the quantities entered on the back of the import licences and the quantities for which they were issued should be notified by the end of November for the information available at that time. Later notifications only serve statistical purposes, so a single notification at the end of July would be sufficient for such quantities.
(5) Under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1084/95 of 15 May 1995 abolishing the protective measure applicable to imports of garlic originating in Taiwan and replacing it with a certificate of origin (5) a certificate of origin is required for the import of garlic from Taiwan. It provides for a regime similar to that laid down in Chapter IV of Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 for garlic of certain other origins. In the interests of legislative simplification and readability, it is appropriate to list all countries to which an origin certificate for garlic is needed in one place. Taiwan should therefore be added to the list of countries in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 to which Chapter IV of that Regulation is applied.

Whereas:
(1) Article 14(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 of 7 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 349/2002(4), provides for the possibility of fixing an indicative quantity, expressed as the same percentage of quantities available under each of the tariff quotas, for the purposes of issuing import licences for the first three quarters of the year.
(2) The data relating, on the one hand, to the quantities of bananas marketed in the Community in 2001, and in particular actual imports, especially during the second quarter, and, on the other hand, to the outlook for supply and consumption on the Community market in the same quarter of 2002 call for the fixing of indicative quantities for quotas A, B and C that ensure satisfactory supply to the Community as a whole and continuity of trade flows between the production and marketing sectors.
(3) On the basis of the same data, the ceiling on the quantities for which individual operators can submit licence applications in respect of the second quarter of 2002 should be fixed for the purposes of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001.
(4) The quantities fixed must also take account of the tariff quota quantities provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2587/2001, and of the allocation of tariff quota C between traditional and non-traditional operators as determined by Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 896/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 349/2002.
(5) Within tariff quota C, the indicative quantity and the maximum per operator should be fixed at a satisfactory level that enables operators to adapt to the reduced quantity of the tariff quota and to the new allocation among the categories of operators and to take account of the amounts fixed as a precaution for the first quarter in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2294/2001(5). In order to prevent disturbance of import flows, provision should be made, at the specific request of the operator, for licences to be issued forthwith on submission of the application.
(6) Since this Regulation must apply before the beginning of the period for the submission of licence applications in respect of the second quarter of 2002, it should enter into force immediately.

(3) To ensure the success of those measures, it is necessary to establish a specific monitoring programme involving Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with the objective of guaranteeing an appropriate level of implementation of the conservation and control measures applicable to fishing activities in relation to the recovery of cod stocks.
(4) That specific monitoring programme should be defined for a period of two years and may be revised in the light of the adoption of new conservation measures or at the request of a Member State. The results obtained by the application of the specific monitoring programme should be periodically evaluated in cooperation with the Member States concerned. Where appropriate, that programme may be amended.
(5) In order to harmonise the inspection and surveillance of the relevant fisheries at Community level, it is appropriate to draw up common rules for the inspection and surveillance activities to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, and that Member States adopt national control programmes in order to match such common rules. To that end, benchmarks for the intensity of inspection and surveillance activities should be fixed, as well as inspection priorities and inspection procedures.
(6) Exchanges of national inspectors between the Member States concerned should be encouraged so as to enhance uniformity of inspection and surveillance practices and help develop the coordination of the control activities between the competent authorities of those Member States.

THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), and in particular Article 33 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Decision ECB/2005/11 of 17 November 2005 on the distribution of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes in circulation to the national central banks of the participating Member States (1) needs to be substantially amended to take account of the distribution of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) income arising from securities purchased in accordance with Decision ECB/2010/5 of 14 May 2010 establishing a securities markets programme (2). It should be recast in the interests of clarity.
(2) Decision ECB/2010/29 of 13 December 2010 on the issue of euro banknotes (3) establishes the allocation of euro banknotes in circulation to the NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the ECB’s capital. Article 4 of Decision ECB/2010/29 and the Annex to that Decision allocates to the ECB 8 % of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation. The ECB holds intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key, for a value equivalent to the value of euro banknotes that it issues.
(3) Under Article 2(2) of Decision ECB/2010/23 of 25 November 2010 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (4), the intra-Eurosystem balances on euro banknotes in circulation are remunerated at the reference rate. Under Article 2(3) of Decision ECB/2010/23, this remuneration is settled by TARGET2 payments.
(4) Recital 7 to Decision ECB/2010/23 states that the income accruing to the ECB on the remuneration of its intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs related to its share of euro banknotes in circulation should in principle be distributed to the NCBs in accordance with the decisions of the Governing Council, in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key in the same financial year it accrues.
(5) In the same manner the ECB’s income arising from securities purchased under the securities markets programme (SMP) should in principle be distributed to the NCBs in proportion to their shares in the subscribed capital key in the same financial year it accrues.
(6) In distributing the ECB’s income on euro banknotes in circulation and the ECB’s income arising from SMP securities, the ECB should take into account an estimate of its financial result for the year that makes due allowance for the need to allocate funds to a provision for foreign exchange rate, interest rate, credit and gold price risks, and for the availability of provisions that may be released to offset anticipated expenses.
(7) In determining the amount of the ECB’s net profit to be transferred to the general reserve fund pursuant to Article 33.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council should consider that any part of that profit which corresponds to income on euro banknotes in circulation and income arising from SMP securities should be distributed to the NCBs in full,","{'header': '11.1.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 6/35', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 25 November 2010\non the interim distribution of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes in circulation and arising from securities purchased under the securities markets programme\n(recast)\n(ECB/2010/24)\n(2011/10/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Decision ECB/2005/11 of 17 November 2005 on the distribution of the income of the European Central Bank on euro banknotes in circulation to the national central banks of the participating Member States(1)needs to be substantially amended to take account of the distribution of the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) income arising from securities purchased in accordance with Decision ECB/2010/5 of 14 May 2010 establishing a securities markets programme(2).

introducing a common measure for the re-establishment of olive groves damaged by frost in certain regions of Greece in 1987
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas, in order to attain the objectives of the common agricultural policy set out in Article 39 (1) (a) and (b) of the Treaty, assistance must be provided for the structural improvement of agriculture in regions which are facing serious problems;
Whereas, in certain regions of Greece, olive trees have been destroyed or seriously damaged by exceptionnaly severe and protracted frost and whereas such damage has been even greater in certain areas;
Whereas, in those areas in particular, olive-growing represents the only economic way of using the soil and accordingly steps should be taken to encourage the re-establishment of olive groves under certain conditions, in order to ensure the survival of farming while preventing any threat of soil erosion or disturbance of the water balance, to protect the environment and to preserve the landscape;
Whereas such encouragement should take the form of a system of investment aids together with additional aid to compensate olive growers for their loss of income, taking into consideration special conditions which must be met by beneficiaries;
Whereas, at the same time, the re-establishment of olive groves should help improve competitiveness by reducing production costs; whereas, therefore, with due regard for the existing structures in Greece, more advantageous conditions should be laid down where the re-establishment is carried out under a collective scheme involving several holdings;

(2) Germany still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereals production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/2004 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provision(s) cited above (1)
Whereas:
I.   PROCEDURE
(1) Since 2006, the Directorate-General for Competition carries out each year an ex-post monitoring exercise of a sample of aid measures implemented by Member States. The Lithuanian excise tax reduction on biofuels scheme was included in the 2011 monitoring exercise, in the context of which the Commission examined how Member States applied a sample of existing schemes for the period 2009-2010. This scheme was approved by the Commission under the case number N44/2005 by its decision K (2005) 2957C of 27 July 2005 (hereinafter referred to as the Commission decision).
(2) The Commission has requested Lithuania to provide the necessary information in view of assessing the way the aid scheme has been implemented in 2009 and 2010, by letters dated 7 October 2011, 27 January 2012 and 26 June 2012. Lithuania provided the requested information by letters dated 10 November 2011, 24 February 2012 and 18 July 2012.
(3) By letter dated 17 July 2013, the Commission informed Lithuania that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in respect of the aid scheme, as it was concerned about a possible misuse of the aid. The Lithuanian authorities provided their observations on 13 August 2013.
(4) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 8 November 2013. The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments.
(5) The Commission received no comments from interested parties.
II.   DESCRIPTION OF THE AID SCHEME
(6) The scheme N 44/2005 consisted of a reduction in the excise tax on biofuels blended with fossil fuels. This reduction applied only to the biofuel component of the mixture. Consequently, the tax rate of the excise duty to be applied to the blended biofuel products was reduced according to the proportion of biofuel in the final blend.
(7) The objective of the scheme was to promote the production and use of biofuels. It was also meant to assist Lithuania in meeting the targets set out in Directive 2003/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport (2).
(8) The tax excise reduction was open to any biofuel producer in Lithuania as well as to any importer of biofuels from another Member State or third countries to Lithuania.
(9) The scheme was approved by the Commission on 27 July 2005 and expired on 31 December 2010.
(10) During the monitoring exercise, the Commission noticed that Lithuania implemented the scheme in a way that apparently was not totally in compliance with the Commission decision.
(11) First of all, as indicated in the Commission decision, Lithuania undertook to annually review the production costs of biofuels eligible for the excise tax reduction as well as the price movement of biomass relative to fossil fuel prices and to adjust the aid amount if necessary in order to avoid any overcompensation and to keep the price of biofuel at the same level of that of conventional fuels. Lithuania also undertook to provide annual monitoring reports to the Commission containing all relevant information on the production costs of the biofuels and the market price of fuels to show that there is no overcompensation. All these elements have been taken into account by the Commission, when assessing the aid scheme and concluding it was compatible with the internal market.
(12) Since 2005 when the Commission decision was adopted, the Commission's relevant services (DG Competition) did not receive any annual report containing relevant information on the production costs of the biofuels and the market price of fuels to demonstrate that the absence of overcompensation was monitored and ensured. Such information was provided by Lithuania at the explicit request of the Commission during the monitoring procedure, but only for the years covered by the respective monitoring exercises.
(13) In the notification of the scheme, Lithuania provided data on the production costs of bioethanol and biodiesel and such data were assessed by the Commission. Lithuania mentioned that apart from bioethanol and biodiesel aid could be granted also to pure vegetable oil and undertook to carry out an analysis as soon as a biofuel product would benefit from the tax reduction to ensure that the reduction would not lead to overcompensation. This information should have been submitted to the Commission in the annual monitoring reports. The Commission's relevant services (DG Competition) did not receive any information that such analysis was carried out by Lithuania.
(14) Secondly, during the monitoring exercise, Lithuania submitted documents proving that the Ministry of Economy had already in 2009 requested that the beneficiaries should provide information on the average costs and sale prices of fuel for 2008. The Ministry of Economy received such data in 2009 and provided them for the selected beneficiaries to the Commission during the 2011 monitoring exercise. Nevertheless, Lithuania did not submit aggregate data on production costs of biofuels. Therefore the Commission was not able to properly verify the absence of overcompensation.
III.   COMMENTS FROM LITHUANIA
(15) Following the opening of the formal investigation, Lithuania submitted additional information to the Commission.
(16) The Lithuanian authorities provided the Commission with copies of reports on the promotion of the use of biofuels from 2005 to 2010.
(17) The Lithuanian authorities explained that although the legislation included the possibility to grant aid under the scheme to pure vegetable oil, no biodiesel was produced from pure vegetable oil. Therefore no such aid was granted under the scheme NN44/2005. This explains why no such report was submitted to the Commission.
(18) For 2009 the annual report includes several tables containing information on the production costs of biofuels, the prices of fossil fuels, the prices of biofuels and the prices of different blends. This information is summarised in the tables below, based on an exchange rate of EUR 1 = LTL 3,4528.

(19) The Lithuanian authorities argued that the data provided for 2009 and 2010 (reflected in the tables above) clearly demonstrates that neither the production of biodiesel nor of bioethanol where overcompensated.
IV.   ASSESSMENT OF THE AID
(20) The Commission concluded already in its decision on N44/2005 that the measure at hand involved aid in the meaning of Article 107(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The Commission assessed this aid scheme on the basis of the 2001 Environmental Aid Guidelines (9), especially its section E.3.3, and concluded that aid was compatible with the internal market.
(21) The Lithuanian authorities confirmed to the Commission that they had submitted annual reports on NN44/2005. These reports were submitted to DG Energy as an annex to the report on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport.
(22) The Lithuanian authorities have now provided DG Competition with copies of the reports they had submitted for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. These reports contain detailed information on the biofuel production costs and sale prices. Furthermore, the price of different fuel blends is included.
(23) In the course of the investigation, the Commission was able to assess that the Lithuanian authorities have complied with point 34 of decision N44/2005 and submitted the necessary annual monitoring reports on the scheme to the Commission.
(24) The Lithuanian authorities explained no biofuels were produced from pure vegetable oil during the period the scheme was operating.
(25) In the course of the investigation the Commission was able to assess that as no biofuel was produced from vegetable oil during the period the scheme was operating that there was no information that needed to be included in the reports submitted to the Commission.
(26) Having now assessed all the information provided by Lithuania on production costs of biofuels and prices of fuels for 2009 and 2010, the Commission agrees that no overcompensation took place on an aggregate basis in 2009 or 2010.
V.   CONCLUSION
(27) The Commission finds that Lithuania has correctly implemented the aid scheme N44/2005, in line with the Commission decision approving it.","{'header': '26.11.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 339/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 11 June 2014\non the State aid SA.18832 (2013/C) (ex 2013/NN) (ex 2011/MX) (ex N 44/2005) implemented by Lithuania for excise tax reductions on biofuels\n(notified under document C(2014) 3600)\n(Only the Lithuanian text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/830/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe State aid scheme N44/2005 which Lithuania has implemented is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and has been correctly implemented, in line with the Commission decision K (2005) 2957C of 27 July 2005.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania.'}]}"

","8.8.2008 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 213/39
COMMISSION DECISION
of 3 July 2008
accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate originating in Russia
(2008/649/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1995/2000 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate (product concerned) originating, inter alia, in Russia. Following an expiry review initiated in September 2005, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1911/2006 (3), renewed for five years these measures at their current level.
(2) The Commission announced on 19 December 2006 the initiation of a partial interim review of those measures by a notice of initiation published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (4) upon request of the Open Joint Stock Company (OJSC) ‘Mineral and Chemical Company Eurochem’, the holding company of OJSC Novomoskovskiy Azot and OJSC Nevinnomyssky Azot, Russia (the exporting producer).
(3) The definitive findings and conclusions of the partial interim review concerning the exporting producer were set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 238/2008 (5). During the interim review the exporting producer expressed an interest in offering a price undertaking but failed to submit a duly substantiated offer within the deadline as set out in Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. However, as stated in the abovementioned Regulation, the Council considered that the exporting producer should exceptionally be allowed to complete its undertaking offer within 10 calendar days from entry into force of that Regulation due to reasons set out in recitals 57 and 58 of Regulation (EC) No 238/2008. Subsequent to the publication of the abovementioned Regulation and within the deadline as set out in that Regulation, the exporting producer submitted an acceptable price undertaking offer in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation.
B.   UNDERTAKING
(4) The exporting producer offered to sell the product concerned falling under CN code 3102 80 00 at or above price levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. In addition, the offer made foresees the indexation of the minimum price in accordance with public international quotations of the product concerned, given that the prices of the product concerned vary significantly. The exporting producer also offered to respect a certain quantitative ceiling in order to avoid that its imports could influence the prices in France as those prices serve as a basis for the indexation. The level of the quantitative ceiling is set in total around 10 % of the total Community consumption of the product concerned.
(5) Moreover, the exporting producer — in order to reduce the risk of price violation by means of cross-compensation of the prices — offered not to sell the product covered by the undertaking to the same customers in the European Community to which they sell other products, with the exception of certain other products for which the exporting producer undertakes to respect a specific price regime.
(6) The exporting producer will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, so that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission. Furthermore, the sales structure of the exporting producer is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumventing the undertaking is limited.
(7) Subsequent to the disclosure of the undertaking offer, the Community industry objected to this undertaking offer. The Community industry argued that the prices of the product concerned are volatile and that an indexation of the minimum price based on the quoted prices of the product concerned is not workable under all market conditions, in particular it would not be workable in a supply driven market, i.e. a market situation in which the buyer can determine the prices due to high supply. Therefore the Community industry suggested to base the indexation of the minimum prices on the prices of natural gas as quoted at Waidhaus. However, in this regard it has to be noted that a natural gas price based indexation is not considered to be feasible in this case due to the poor correlation of the product concerned and natural gas prices. As concerns the Community industry's comments that on a supply driven market the current indexation formula will not be workable, it is noted that the Commission will monitor this undertaking and should prima facie evidence exist that the undertaking is no longer workable, the Commission should act expeditiously to remedy the situation, as set out in recital 11.
(8) The Community industry further argued that the level of the quantitative ceiling would be too high and requested it to be set maximum at 3 % of total Community consumption. It claimed that the exporting producer would be able to influence the prices on the Community market with a higher amount and thus make the indexation of the minimum price unworkable. In this respect it should be noted that the quantitative ceiling was established at a level which was considered to (i) satisfactorily limit the risk of the exporting producer influencing the prices on the French market thus rendering the indexation formula unworkable (ii) be sufficiently high so that the undertaking remains practicable at the same time. Moreover, the Community industry failed to substantiate its argument as to how any quantity exceeding 3 % of the total Community consumption would have a detrimental impact on prices.
(9) The Community industry proposed moreover the introduction of a ‘progressive quantitative ceiling’ whereby the quantitative ceiling of the exporting producer shall be increased on a yearly basis depending on the exporting producer respecting the terms of the undertaking. This suggestion is however rejected because the sole aim of the quantitative ceiling is to limit the risk of influencing the prices on which the indexation of minimum price is based. It should also be noted that in case of a breach of the undertaking, the acceptance of the undertaking as such may be withdrawn.
(10) In view of the above, the undertaking offered by the Russian exporting producer is acceptable.
(11) However, due to the special elements of this undertaking (i.e. in particular the indexation formula) the Commission will assess the practicability of the undertaking regularly. For its practicability assessment, the Commission will take into account, but is not restricted to, the following criteria: the prices of the product concerned in the French market; the level of the coefficient of the indexation formula; the sales prices of the exporting producer as reported by them in their quarterly sales reports; profitability of the Community industry. In particular, should this practicability assessment show that the decrease of the profitability of the Community industry is attributable to the undertaking, the Commission endeavours to withdraw the acceptance of the undertaking expeditiously in accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation.
(12) In order to enable the Commission to monitor ‘effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release into free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional on (i) the presentation of an undertaking invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 789/2008 (6): (ii) the fact that imported goods are manufactured, shipped and invoiced directly by the said companies to the first independent customer in the Community; and (iii) the fact that the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the undertaking invoice. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable.
(13) To further ensure the respect of this undertaking, importers have been made aware by the Regulation (EC) No 789/2008 that the non-fulfillment of the conditions provided for by this Regulation, or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertaking, may lead to the customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions.
(14) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '8.8.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 213/39', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 3 July 2008\naccepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate originating in Russia\n(2008/649/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertaking offered by the exporting producer mentioned below in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate in aqueous or ammoniacal solution originating in Russia is hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTaric Additional Code\nRussia\nOpen Joint Stock Company (OJSC) Mineral and Chemical Company ‘Eurochem’, member of the Eurochem group of companies, Moscow, Russia, for goods produced by its related company OJSC NAK Azot, Novomoskovsk, Russia, or by its related company OJSC Nevinnomyssky Azot, Nevinnomyssk, Russia, either sold directly to the first independent customer in the Community or the same goods sold by Eurochem Trading GmbH, Zug, Switzerland, to the first independent customer in the Community\nA885'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Initiation
(1) On 12 September 1997, a complaint was lodged pursuant to Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter 'the Basic Regulation`), by the Association for Laser Optical Reading Systems on behalf of Community producers whose collective output represented significantly more than 50 % of the total Community production of certain laser optical reading systems for use in motor vehicles (LORS). The complaint contained sufficient evidence of injurious dumping to justify the opening of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(2) On 25 October 1997, the Commission announced by means of a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the European Community of LORS originating in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the People's Republic of China (hereinafter 'the PRC`) and Taiwan and commenced an investigation.
2. Investigation period
(3) The investigation period for the determination of dumping covered the period from l October 1996 to 30 September 1997 (hereinafter referred to as 'the investigation period`). The examination of injury covers the period January 1994 to the end of the investigation period.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT
1. General remarks
(4) In the notice of initiation, the Commission had defined the product scope as laser optical reading systems comprising compact disc tuners (CD tuners), disc-changers and car radios with a disc control device (car radio).
(5) The further investigation has firstly established that the above elements taken together cannot be regarded as a 'system` forming one single product, in spite of certain given functional links existing between these elements, as this would require that the elements could only properly function together. Indeed, the car radio can function on its own and does also not contain a laser optical reading mechanism. A CD tuner likewise can function on its own. The disc-changer is the only element which must be linked to one of the other elements in order to function. However, this cannot be considered sufficient to characterise all three elements taken together as a system and thus one single product.
(6) Secondly, the investigation has by the same token established that the product coverage would encompass, with respect to car radios, a large percentage of these elements even if they are used outside the laser optical reading system, i.e. if they would not be used to reproduce CDs.
(7) For these reasons, it is considered that the abovementioned three elements cannot be regarded as one system consisting of one single product. Therefore, given the results of the investigation, it was necessary to assess the three products separately, namely car radios, CD tuners and disc-changers.
2. Car radios
(8) With respect to car radios, the Community industry has agreed on reducing the product concerned by the present proceeding to CD tuners and disc-changers by withdrawing the complaint as far as car radios are concerned. As the investigation has not revealed any Community interest grounds to continue with the proceeding in the absence of a complaint, the proceeding with respect to car radios should thus be terminated in accordance with Article 9(1) of the Basic Regulation.
3. CD tuners
3.1. Product under consideration and like product
(9) CD tuners are products which incorporate in a single housing a compact disc player, able to reproduce (read) digital audio signals (essentially music) stored on one or more CDs, without having the ability to record such audio signals (CN codes 8527 21 20 and 8527 21 70). A CD tuner generally also incorporates a radio broadcast receiver. In this respect it was established that CD tuners manufactured and sold by the Community producers in the Community market are alike, or closely resemble, CD tuners manufactured in and sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. Furthermore, CD tuners sold in the countries concerned are also alike, or closely resemble, CD tuners sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. All these products therefore are to be considered a single product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the Basic Regulation.
3.2. Dumping and injury
(10) The investigation established the existence of dumping and injury. However, given the conclusions as set out below, it is not necessary to detail these findings.
3.3. Causation
(11) Pursuant to Articles 3(6) and 3(7) of the Basic Regulation, it was examined whether the imports concerned have caused material injury or whether the injury was caused by effects other than dumping.
(12) In this respect, the market share of the dumped imports decreased by nine percentage points between 1994 and the investigation period, i.e. from around 61 % to around 52 %, while Community consumption increased by around 129 % during the same period of time. This indicates that the exporters from the countries concerned, while increasing their exports in absolute terms, did not do so to an extent reflecting the massive expansion of the consumption in the Community.
Prices of the exporters have declined by more than 18 % between 1994 and the investigation period. By comparison, the Community industry only reduced their prices by around 8 %.
Limited price undercutting was found for the imports concerned. In addition, it mainly concerned non-homogeneous products with a great variety of features and technical differences and subject to rapid technological development. Therefore, the effects of the undercutting cannot be found to have had a clear material impact on the Community industry's prices.
(13) The Commission has also examined other factors that may have had an effect on the situation of the Community industry.
With respect to other third countries, between 1994 and the investigation period, their import volumes have increased significantly more than both the consumption and the imports from the countries concerned, i.e. by 700 % (from around 67 000 units to around 500 000 units), and their market shares also went up considerably by 16 percentage points, from around 8 % to around 24 %. This shows that these other imports have fully participated in and even increased more quickly than the expansion found for the Community consumption.
As regards prices, limited information gathered from certain cooperating interested parties may indicate that there has been high price undercutting by these imports.
The increase of the market share of the imports from third countries by 16 percentage points, seen in comparison to the loss of market share of the exports from the countries concerned of around nine percentage points, and the loss of the Community industry of two percentage points, demonstrates that the exports from the countries concerned have been more than fully replaced by the imports from the abovementioned third countries. Indeed, it appears that the market shares of both the Community industry and the exporters from the countries concerned suffered from these imports.
(14) In view of the above and particular attention paid to imports from other third countries, it would appear that imports from the countries concerned did not in isolation have a materially injurious impact on the situation of the Community industry. Imports from other third countries have contributed to such an extent to the precarious situation of the Community industry that they should be considered as breaking the causal link between the dumping and the injury found.
3.4. Conclusion
(15) The proceeding with respect to CD tuners should therefore be terminated.
4. Disc-changers
4.1. Product under consideration and like product
(16) With respect to disc-changers, these are sound-reproducing apparatus with a laser reading system usually placed in the boot of a motor vehicle (CN code ex 8519 99 18). They are able to store and process several CDs. In order to function and to reproduce sounds, they must be connected to a 'head` unit with a disc control device (usually a car radio). In this respect the investigation has established that disc-changers manufactured and sold by the Community industry in the Community market are alike, or closely resemble, disc-changers manufactured in and sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. Furthermore, disc-changers sold in the countries concerned are also alike, or closely resemble, disc-changers sold for export from the countries concerned to the Community. All these products therefore are to be considered a single product within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the Basic Regulation.
4.2. Dumping, injury and causation
(17) The investigation established the existence of injurious dumping. However, given the conclusions as set out below, it is not necessary to detail these findings.
4.3. Community interest
(18) When assessing the Community interest aspects of the present case, the Commission examined the likely costs and benefits that the imposition of measures would have on the economic operators concerned.
The market share of the Community industry started from 0 % in 1996 but still only reached 1,4 % during the investigation period. On the basis of an average duty of 20 % on the imports value of the product concerned, the amount of duties imposed on imports of this product would represent between 6 and 10 times the total value of production of the Community industry during the investigation period. Even if production were to be expanded in accordance with the plans of the Community industry, the total value of production would, in the foreseeable future, only be a fraction of the amount of duties imposed. The above situation results from the fact that around 81 % of the disc-changers sold within the Community during the investigation period originated in the countries under investigation.
In addition, when setting up its production, the Community industry was well aware that it was doing so in an environment of depressed prices. Disc-changers had been on the market for a number of years and have indeed been imported by the Community industry, mainly from Japan. The Community industry only commenced with its Community activity in 1996, when the product was already well-established on the market, i.e. at a very late stage. Under these circumstances it is difficult to assess the future development of the industry and the possible beneficial effect of measures.
Furthermore, the overall advantages to be gained by the Community industry in this particular situation, which are likely to be minimal given the relatively low level of employment immediately affected, must be weighed against the probable disadvantages, in particular for consumers. Indeed, the product under consideration is a widespread consumer electronics product with a large growth potential. It is likely that the imposition of duties would severely limit consumer choice, as many exporters, especially those with high duties, would be likely to withdraw from the Community market. This loss of choice as regards the current variety of models available could not be compensated in the foreseeable future by the Community industry. The current high market presence of these exporters and the fact that they offer a wide model range comprising high quality products would mean that, if they were to withdraw, consumers would be deprived of taking advantage of technological variety and development, without having any viable alternative in the foreseeable future. In this situation it is considered that the interests of consumers are by far outweighing the interests of the Community industry.
In such a situation, it can be considered that the imposition of measures would disproportionately affect importers, traders and consumers of the product concerned.
Conclusion on Community interest
(19) In view of all the above, compelling reasons exist on Community interest grounds not to adopt anti-dumping measures as regards imports of disc-changers from the countries concerned.
4.4. Conclusion
(20) Under these circumstances, the proceeding with respect to disc-changers should be terminated on the grounds of Community interest.
C. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(21) The complainants were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate this proceeding. Subsequently, the complainants made known their views, which were then examined in detail by the Commission,","{'title': ""1999/55/EC: Commission Decision of 21 December 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain laser optical reading systems, and the main constituent elements thereof, for use in motor vehicles, originating in Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the People's Republic of China and Taiwan (notified under document number C(1998) 4329)""}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(c), Articles 11 and 12 and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 (2) lays down rules for the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of animals, in relation to bluetongue, in and from the restricted zones. It also establishes the conditions for exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of susceptible animals, their semen, ova and embryos provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC.
(2) New scientific information recently gathered by several Member States on bluetongue virus pathogenesis indicates that the trans-placental transmission of the bluetongue virus is likely to occur at least for serotype 8. Therefore, the precautionary measures taken to prevent the possible spread of that disease by pregnant animals or certain newborn animals, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 384/2008 (3), should be maintained.
(3) Animals that were immune to the bluetongue infection before artificial insemination or mating, due to vaccination with a modified life vaccine or an inactivated vaccine, are not considered to pose any significant risk as regards that disease provided that sufficient time has elapsed between vaccination and insemination or mating. Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 384/2008, only covers animals vaccinated by inactivated vaccines.
(4) As preliminary scientific information recently obtained does not indicates that there is an additional risk associated with pregnant animals vaccinated with live modified vaccines at least 60 days prior to insemination or mating, it should be possible to exempt all immunised animals vaccinated with either inactivated or modified live vaccines from the exit ban provided that sufficient time has elapsed between vaccination and insemination or mating.
(5) Animals that might not meet all the requirements necessary to move from a holding located in a restricted zone to another holding located outside the restricted zone in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 but that are exported to a third country do not pose an additional risk for the Community health status, since they are not destined for a holding in the Community. Consequently, the requirements for their movement to the exit point as defined in Commission Decision 93/444/EEC of 2 July 1993 on detailed rules governing intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products intended for exportation to third countries (4) should not exceed those applied to animals sent to slaughterhouses in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007. Accordingly, no additional certification concerning the conditions laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should be required where such animals are accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Decision 93/444/EEC. The reference to Decision 93/444/EEC in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be deleted.

It also establishes the conditions for exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of susceptible animals, their semen, ova and embryos provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC.\n\n((2)) New scientific information recently gathered by several Member States on bluetongue virus pathogenesis indicates that the trans-placental transmission of the bluetongue virus is likely to occur at least for serotype 8. Therefore, the precautionary measures taken to prevent the possible spread of that disease by pregnant animals or certain newborn animals, provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 384/2008(3), should be maintained.\n\n((3)) Animals that were immune to the bluetongue infection before artificial insemination or mating, due to vaccination with a modified life vaccine or an inactivated vaccine, are not considered to pose any significant risk as regards that disease provided that sufficient time has elapsed between vaccination and insemination or mating. Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 384/2008, only covers animals vaccinated by inactivated vaccines.\n\n((4)) As preliminary scientific information recently obtained does not indicates that there is an additional risk associated with pregnant animals vaccinated with live modified vaccines at least 60 days prior to insemination or mating, it should be possible to exempt all immunised animals vaccinated with either inactivated or modified live vaccines from the exit ban provided that sufficient time has elapsed between vaccination and insemination or mating.\n\n((5)) Animals that might not meet all the requirements necessary to move from a holding located in a restricted zone to another holding located outside the restricted zone in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 but that are exported to a third country do not pose an additional risk for the Community health status, since they are not destined for a holding in the Community. Consequently, the requirements for their movement to the exit point as defined in Commission Decision 93/444/EEC of 2 July 1993 on detailed rules governing intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products intended for exportation to third countries(4)should not exceed those applied to animals sent to slaughterhouses in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007. Accordingly, no additional certification concerning the conditions laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should be required where such animals are accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Decision 93/444/EEC. The reference to Decision 93/444/EEC in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be deleted.\n\n((6)) If in accordance with animal welfare rules a rest period is foreseen due to the length of the transport for animals moved to a slaughterhouse or exit point, the derogations for movements of such animals should only apply if it is possible that the rest period takes place in a

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes haloxyfop-R.
(3) For haloxyfop-R the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For haloxyfop-R the rapporteur Member State was Denmark and all relevant information was submitted on 21 November 2003.
(4) The assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 28 July 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance haloxyfop-R (4). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 24 November 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for haloxyfop-R.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns were identified. The risk assessment for groundwater contamination could not be concluded. In particular it was found that the use of haloxyfop-R, in the scenarios presented by the notifier, led to the appearance of a number of metabolites which are persistent and can leach easily into the water table, with potentially negative effects on drinking water. This raised concerns which could not be resolved on the basis of the data presented within the legal deadlines by the notifier. Moreover, based on the available data, concerns remain as regards the risk assessment for mammals. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that haloxyfop-R met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments advanced, the above concerns remained unsolved, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing haloxyfop-R satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Haloxyfop-R should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing haloxyfop-R are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing haloxyfop-R, should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for haloxyfop-R according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 163/22', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 19 June 2007\nconcerning the non-inclusion of haloxyfop-R in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document number C(2007) 2548)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/437/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 703/2001(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement on the relations as regards sea fishing between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco became null and void on 30 November 1999. Consequently, more than 400 fishing vessels and about 4300 fishermen operating in that context were forced to stop their fishing activities at that date.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001(3) introduced derogations from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999(4) for shipowners and fishermen who were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco, applicable to certain types of premiums and public aid granted by administrative decision between 1 July 2001 and 30 June 2003. The same Regulation introduced a specific action to supplement the measures taken in the context of Structural Fund assistance in the Member States concerned due to the non-renewal of the fisheries agreement with Morocco.
(3) The fishermen affected by the non-renewal of that fisheries agreement may find themselves unemployed following conversion of their vessel to another activity in the same way as fishermen whose vessel has permanently stopped its activity. In order to ensure that all fishermen are treated equally, the provisions stipulating that individual lump sums may be paid to fishermen only provided the fishing vessel on which they were employed has permanently stopped its activities should be derogated from.
(4) The minimum period of less than one year referred to in Article 12(4)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 during which the fisherman may not work as a fisherman again without being required to pay back the premium received pro rata temporis should be calculated from 1 January 2002, the date from which temporary cessation payments may no longer be paid, and not from the date on which the premium was actually paid.
(5) In view of the deadlines currently in force, in order to be able to apply the abovementioned amendments, the time limits for the date of the administrative decision, the final date for eligibility of expenditure and the final date for presenting the request for payment of the balance should all be extended by 12 months,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2325/2003 of 17 December 2003 amending Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 2561/2001 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the market in the sugar sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1069/89 (2), and in particular Articles 2 (3), 3 (4) and 4 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas, when sugar prices are fixed, account should be taken of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution which the Community intends to make to the harmonious development of world trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are in particular to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure the availability of supplies and ensure that they reach consumers at reasonable prices;
Whereas, in order to attain these objectives, the target price for sugar must be fixed at a level which, taking into account in particular the resultant level of the intervention price, ensures a fair remuneration for beet and sugar-cane producers while at the same time respecting consumers' interests, and which is likely to maintain the balance between the prices of the principal agricultural products;
Whereas, as a result of the characteristics of the sugar market, the risks involved in this trade are relatively slight; whereas, consequently, when the intervention price for sugar is being fixed, the difference between the target price and the intervention price may be fixed at a relatively low level;
Whereas the intervention prices to be fixed for the 1989/90 marketing year will be lower than those for the 1988/89 marketing year; whereas, in order to avoid any depreciation in stock which remain free at the end of the latter year and which form part of the quotas of those eligible for reimbursement for storage costs for such stocks under Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 it should be provided that if such stocks are disposed of between 1 July and 30 September 1989, they shall continue to benefit from the price for the 1988/89 marketing year;
Whereas the basic price for beet must take account of the intervention price and of the costs of processing and delivering the beet to factories and be based on an estimated Community yield of 130 kilograms of white sugar per tonne of beet at 16 % sugar content;
Whereas the production of sugar-cane and raw cane-sugar in the French overseas departments always encounters difficulties that are peculiar to the crop, environmental and operating conditions of this sector; whereas these crops represent an essential component of the economy of the French overseas departments; whereas, pursuant to Article 227 (2) of the Treaty, the Council is to take care, within the framework of the procedures provided for by the Treaty, that the economic and social development of the French overseas departments is made possible; whereas, moreover, Italy is carrying out a restructuring of the sugar-beet sector and sugar production by means of restructuring plans under Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty; whereas, under these circumstances, Italy should be authorized to continue to grant, for the 1989/90 and 1990/91 marketing years, national aid on downward-sliding terms as compared with the overall financial commitment already authorized for aid for the 1988/89
marketing year; whereas it is neverthelses desirable that, for the marketing years concerned and without prejudice to Articles 92 to 94 of the Treaty, the authorization to adjust this aid should be maintained when the aid is linked to restructuring plans; whereas, for the aforesaid reasons, provision should also be made for the extension, pending the decisions to be adopted for sugar under the programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the French overseas departments, 'Poseidom', of the system of national aid authorized by Article 46 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 applicable to the cane and sugar produced in the French overseas departments,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1254/89 of 3 May 1989 fixing, for the 1989/90 marketing year, inter alia, certain sugar prices and the standard quality of beet', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas according to the second subparagraph of Article 9 (1) of Directive 89/662/EEC and the second subparagraph of Article 10 (1) of Directive 90/425/EEC, the Member State of origin shall implement on its territory the appropriate measures to prevent all situations which may constitute a serious hazard to animals or to human health;
Whereas, to protect animal and human health in the Community, the Commission adopted Decision 94/474/EC of 27 July 1994 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and repealing Decisions 89/469/EEC and 90/200/EEC (4), as last amended by Decision 95/287/EC (5), Decision 92/290/EEC of 14 May 1992 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine embryos in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom (6), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, Decision 94/381/EC of 27 June 1994 concerning certain protection measures with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian derived protein (7), as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (8), Decision 94/382/EC of 27 June 1994 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste of ruminant origin, with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (9), as amended by Decision 95/29/EC (10), and Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (11), as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (12);
Whereas, upon the publication in March 1996 of new information on certain cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease where the link to BSE could not be ruled out, Community bodies have recognized that decisive action must be taken in order to control and finally eradicate BSE;
Whereas Portugal has had cases of BSE in its native cattle;
Whereas in April 1996 Portugal presented to the Commission a plan laying down supplementary measures to control and eradicate BSE in Portugal, hereafter referred to as 'the plan`;
Whereas the principal elements of the plan are:
(a) compulsory slaughter of animals identified as imported from the United Kingdom, all animals in herds where cases of BSE have occurred and all animals in other herds identified as belonging to the same birth cohort as affected animals;
(b) an improved system of health monitoring of holdings with bovine animals and intensified surveillance of the feed manufacturing industry to prevent the possible use of meat-and-bone meal;
Whereas a programme to control BSE and reduce the number of future cases should concentrate on removal of animals most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in accordance with the principle laid down in point 6 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996;
Whereas the Council concluded that such an option should be open to Member States other than the United Kingdom on a case-by-case basis;
Whereas, however, there are factors in Portugal which make it difficult in practice to identify animals within herds that are most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in view of low herd size and the lack of full data for the identification of high-risk groups;
Whereas, consequently, the Commission can accept under these particular circumstances and in order to restore consumer confidence that a whole herd slaughter policy be adopted for Portugal in relation to BSE to be financed with a Community contribution on the basis of the same principles and in accordance with the same procedure as laid down in points 8 and 9 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996;
Whereas the Commission, in accordance with point 9 of those Council conclusions, has adopted Regulation (EC) No 716/96 (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 835/96 (14), and Regulation (EC) No 717/96 (15), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 841/96 (16), in order to provide market support;
Whereas a similar measure will be proposed in order to provide for financial assistance to Portugal for the present plan;
Whereas the plan amended on 12 June 1996 will contribute to the reduction in the number of BSE cases and increase the controls relating to the disease, and it should therefore be approved;
Whereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in Portugal to verify the application of the measures approved by this Decision;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) N° 170/83 provides that the conservation measures necessary  to achieve the aims set out in Article 1 are to be formulated in the light of the available  scientific advice;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3094/86(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 2220/89(3),  lays down the general technical rules for the catching and landing of the biological resources  found in Community waters;
Whereas it is appropriate, for practical reasons, to make a minor adjustment, in the Firth of Clyde  (ICES sub-area VI), to the line separating the zone in which the minimum mesh size is 80  millimetres and that in which it is 90 millimetres;
Whereas, in the light of the latest scientific advice, provision should be made for an increase in  mesh size when fishing in region 3 for N°rway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) and prawns (Parapenaeus  longirostris, Aristeus antennatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea);
Whereas it is necessary to reduce catches of small-sized hake, the stock of which in region 3 is  fished in close association with N°rway lobster; whereas recent experiments using the selective  trawl for N°rway lobster fishing have suggested that this type of gear can substantially reduce the  number of small-sized hake caught, without affecting catches of the target species; whereas use of  the selective trawl can also result in an improvement in the quality of the fish caught and,  consequently, in increased incomes for fishermen; whereas use of the selective trawl in the N°rway lobster fisheries in region 3 should therefore be encouraged;
Whereas, in the light of the latest scientific advice, it is necessary to increase the minimum  landing size for bass so as to protect the juvenile part of bass stocks as part of the efficient  long-term management of resources in regions 2 and 3;
Whereas the results of the latest experiments on the selectivity of trawls used for fishing megrim  and little sole show that the minimum landing sizes applicable to these two species do not  correspond with the minimum mesh sizes specified for region 3 and the landing sizes should  therefore be reduced,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4056/89 of 19 December 1989 amending for the ninth time Regulation (EEC) No 3094/86 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) N° 3094/86 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.In Annex I, in region 2, the entries which refer to West of Scotland and Rockall (ICES sub-area  VI) shall be replaced by the entry given in Annex I to this Regulation.\n\n2.In Annex I, for region 3, the entries shown for the entire region and for the following  authorized target species:\n\n-prawn (Parapenaeus longirostris, Aristeus antennatus and Aristaeomorpha foliacea), and -N°rway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) shall be replaced by the entries given in Annex II to this Regulation.\n\n3.In Annex II, the data concerning the minimum sizes for megrim (Lepidorhambus spp.), bass  (Dicentrarchus labrax) and for little sole (Dicologoglossa cuneata) shall be replaced by the data  set out in Annex III to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in  the Official Journal of the European Communities.'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 (2), shall apply from 1 April 1990.', 'text': 'Article 1 (2), shall apply from 1 April 1990.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all  Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 1989.\n\nFor the CouncilThe PresidentJ.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular Article 36(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) contained the list of active substances approved at Union level for use in biocidal products. Commission Directive 2009/92/EC (3) added the active substance bromadiolone for use in products belonging to product-type 14, Rodenticides, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(2) In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/8/EC, the companies Pelgar International Limited and Unichem d.o.o. (‘the applicants’) submitted applications to the United Kingdom for authorisation of biocidal products containing bromadiolone as a wax block formulation (‘the contested products’). The United Kingdom authorised before 1 September 2013 the contested products for a number of uses including professional application in and around buildings and in sewers. A number of Member States have subsequently authorised the contested products through mutual recognition.
(3) The German competent authority for biocidal products received applications for mutual recognition of authorisations according to Article 4(1) of Directive 98/8/EC for the contested products.
(4) Germany has notified the Commission, the other Member States and the applicants of its proposal to refuse the authorisations in accordance with Article 4(4) of Directive 98/8/EC, as Germany considers that the contested products do not meet the requirements of Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC with regard to effects on human health.
(5) According to the notifications, Germany disagrees with the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom regarding the dermal absorption value used in such evaluation (0,04 %). Germany considers this value as inappropriate according to OEDC standards on in vitro dermal absorption methods (4) and pointed out that based on a more conservative value of 0,36 % as per these standards the assessment results in an unacceptable dermal exposure to bromadiolone for professional users.
(6) For each notification, the Commission invited the other Member States and the applicants to submit comments to the notification in writing within 90 days in accordance with Article 27(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. Comments were submitted within that deadline by the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany and one of the applicants. The notification was also discussed between Commission representatives and representatives of Member States’ Competent Authorities for biocidal products in the meeting of the Product Authorisation and Mutual Recognition Facilitation Group of 14 May 2013.
(7) From the abovementioned discussions and comments, it follows that the United Kingdom carried out the evaluation of the dermal absorption in a way which is compatible with the latest agreed EU guidance (5), pursuant to which the possibility of reading across existing data from the active substance approval is accepted.
(8) First, the United Kingdom used a dermal absorption value from a study considered as reliable in the context of the EU approval of the active substance bromadiolone, to which the applicants held the required letter of access from the data owner. Second, the dermal absorption study from which that value was obtained was carried out with a similar bait formulation to that of the contested products, as recommended by the abovementioned guidance.
(9) Finally, the United Kingdom evaluated the product with the benefit of expert judgment to justify that the specific conditions of the study from which the dermal absorption value was obtained resembled more closely the actual exposure conditions for professional users loading wax blocks in bait stations. This approach is compatible with the abovementioned guidance and the common principles for the evaluation of dossiers for biocidal products as provided for by paragraph 12 of Annex VI to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(10) In the light of the above arguments, the Commission supports the conclusions of the assessment carried out by the United Kingdom and the other Member States having authorised the contested products through mutual recognition that they do not have unacceptable effects on human health, as required by Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. The Commission therefore considers that the request by Germany to refuse the authorisations cannot be justified on the grounds put forward.
(11) Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 shall apply to the contested products in accordance with the provisions of Article 92(2) of that Regulation. Since the legal basis for this Decision is Article 36(3) of that Regulation, this decision should be addressed to all Member States by virtue of Article 36(4) of that Regulation.

derogating from Regulations (EC) No 1122/2009 and (EU) No 65/2011 as regards the reduction of the amounts of the aid for late submission of single applications in relation to alpine pastures in mountain areas of Austria for 2013
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (1), and in particular Article 91 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (2), and in particular Article 142(c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system, under the direct support schemes for farmers provided for that Regulation, as well as for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards cross-compliance under the support scheme provided for the wine sector (3) provides, in its Article 23(1), for reductions to be applied in the case of late submission of an aid application as well as of documents, contracts or declarations which are constitutive for the eligibility for the aid.
(2) According to Article 8(3) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 of 27 January 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, as regards the implementation of control procedures as well as cross-compliance in respect of rural development support measures (4), Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 apply mutatis mutandis to payment claims under Title I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011.
(3) Austria has implemented a system of single aid application which covers, pursuant to Article 19(3) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, several direct payment applications and certain applications for aid granted under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.
(4) In accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 and Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011, Austria has fixed 15 May 2013 as the latest day until which single applications for 2013 can be submitted.
(5) In order to enable the implementation of the control system the third subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 requires Member States to ensure that agricultural parcels are reliably identified and to require the single application to be accompanied by documents identifying the parcels.
(6) In response to deficiencies related to the determination of the eligible area of agricultural parcels, which were detected in the past, Austria has started updating its Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) for alpine pastures as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.
(7) Austria has experienced exceptional circumstances in weather conditions of the winter season 2012/2013 preventing the authorities from ending up the process of updating the LPIS for agricultural parcels of alpine pastures in those mountain areas before the launch of the single application process. The necessary rapid field visits of those parcels in high altitude have been delayed by heavy and late-season snowfalls. Consequently, farmers intending to submit a single application relating to agricultural parcels of alpine pastures will be provided with the updated information about the parcels later than foreseen.
(8) This situation has affected the ability of applicants to submit single aid applications and payment claims relating to agricultural parcels of alpine pastures in Austria within the time limits provided for in Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 and Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011.
(9) Due to those difficulties, the application process in 2013 is expected to start later than the date on which the process started in the previous years for farmers with agricultural parcels of alpine pastures. The information submitted by the Austrian authorities to the Commission on their capacity to finalise the update of the LPIS for those areas shows that a derogation until 28 June 2013 is necessary to enable all farmers and beneficiaries concerned to submit their single applications.
(10) By way of derogation from Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 it is therefore appropriate not to apply reductions on grounds of late submission of single applications in respect of those farmers who submitted their single applications relating to at least one agricultural parcel of alpine pasture as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 by 28 June 2013 at the latest.
(11) Similarly, by way of derogation from Article 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 and in respect of payment claims under Title I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 relating to at least one agricultural parcel of alpine pastures as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, it is appropriate not to apply reductions on grounds of late submission of payment claims which were submitted by 28 June 2013 at the latest.
(12) Since the derogations should cover the single applications and payment claims submitted for aid year 2013, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies retroactively.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of the Rural Development Committee and the Management Committee for Direct Payments,","{'header': '9.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 188/5', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 649/2013\nof 8 July 2013\nderogating from Regulations (EC) No 1122/2009 and (EU) No 65/2011 as regards the reduction of the amounts of the aid for late submission of single applications in relation to alpine pastures in mountain areas of Austria for 2013', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 as regards cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system, under the direct support schemes for farmers provided for that Regulation, as well as for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards cross-compliance under the support scheme provided for the wine sector(3)provides, in its Article 23(1), for reductions to be applied in the case of late submission of an aid application as well as of documents, contracts or declarations which are constitutive for the eligibility for the aid.\n\n((2)) According to Article 8(3) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 65/2011 of 27 January 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, as regards the implementation of control procedures as well as cross-compliance in respect of rural development support measures(4), Articles 22 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 applymutatis mutandisto payment claims under Title I of Part II of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011.\n\n((3)) Austria has implemented a system of single aid application which covers, pursuant to Article 19(3) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, several direct payment applications and certain applications for aid granted under Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 and Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 65/2011, Austria has fixed 15 May 2013 as the latest day until which single applications for 2013 can be submitted.\n\n((5)) In order to enable the implementation of the control system the third subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 requires Member States to ensure that agricultural parcels are reliably identified and to require the single application to be accompanied by documents identifying the parcels.\n\n((6)) In response to deficiencies related to the determination of the eligible area of agricultural parcels, which were detected in the past, Austria has started updating its Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) for alpine pastures as defined by Austria within the mountain areas designated pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005.\n\n((7)) Austria has experienced exceptional circumstances in weather conditions of the winter season 2012/2013 preventing the authorities from ending up the process of updating the LPIS for agricultural parcels of alpine pastures in those mountain areas before the launch of the single application process.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in June 2001 Germany received an application from BASF AG for the inclusion of the active substance tritosulfuron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2002/268/EC (2) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(2) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossier was necessary in order to allow it to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.
(3) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The rapporteur Member State submitted the draft assessment report to the Commission on 5 September 2002.
(4) Following submission of the draft assessment report by the rapporteur Member State, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicant and to have the Rapporteur Member State examine that information and submit its assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossier is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC.

It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for tritosulfuron will have been completed within 24 months.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network (the interoperability Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 3(1) and (5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 (2) lays down requirements for the coordinated introduction of data link services based on air-ground point-to-point data communications.
(2) Air navigation service providers and operators have reported technical issues when implementing Regulation (EC) No 29/2009, particularly disconnections, known as Provider Aborts (‘PAs’), of existing air-ground data communications enabling the operations of data link services (‘DLS’) and which are beyond acceptable performance levels. For that reason certain air navigation service providers have already taken mitigation measures, consisting of the restriction of DLS operations to aircraft equipped with specific avionics through so-called ‘white lists’, so as to address potential safety impacts of those PAs in the operations of data link service.
(3) At the request of the Commission, the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘EASA’) conducted an investigation (3) to identify the root cause or causes of those technical issues and to recommend measures to address them. The investigation revealed that the random PA occurrences could not be attributed to a single, predictable cause but rather to a combination of factors related to the radio frequency environment and to the current single frequency implementation of the data link infrastructure. It was found that this excessive rate of random PAs causes a degradation in the network performance potentially presenting aviation safety risks by increasing the pilots and controllers' workload and creating confusion leading to a loss of situational awareness.
(4) EASA concluded in its investigation report that acceptable data link performance levels can only be established by deploying a multi-frequency infrastructure, which is also to be optimised for radio frequency interference prevention. It recommended establishing and implementing a plan of actions to further investigate the identified technical issues and to validate the necessary technical solutions. However, these measures require time and EASA therefore recommended to reconsider the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 and the timeframes of that Regulation. EASA also recommended that the implementation of the plan of actions be preferably performed by the deployment manager as referred to in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 409/2013 (4).
(5) In addition, with a view to addressing specifically the aviation safety aspect of DLS operations pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 29/2009, on 23 May 2014 EASA issued Safety Information Bulletin No 2014-14, which recommends that operators revert from data to voice when confronted with a high level of PAs.
(6) In line with the EASA recommendations, the Commission instructed the SESAR Joint Undertaking (‘SJU’) to draft a work plan for further investigation of the identified issues and for carrying out the specific actions recommended by EASA. The work plan, as presented by the SJU, includes two phases of studies and remedial actions deemed necessary in relation to, in particular, the data link ground infrastructure issues and the finding and validation of technical airborne solutions. The preliminary results and remedial actions are expected by 2016, while further validation may require two more years.
(7) Therefore, particularly due to the observed technical difficulties and shortcomings in the performance of the deployed DLS infrastructure, which have already led to certain mitigation measures being enacted, and their potential impact on aviation safety and given that the necessary studies and actions to identify and remedy them are expected to be completed during the course of 2018, the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 should be deferred.
(8) For the same reasons referred to in recital 7, and in order to retain the consistency of the requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 29/2009, certain other timeframes provided for in that Regulation should also be amended.
(9) In order to provide and operate data link services built on the required validated ground DLS capability, the dates of application for the requirements relating to the ground equipage for the airspace defined in Parts A and B of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 should be amended so as to ensure that the ground infrastructure is available 24 months before the date of application of the requirements relating to the airborne side. However, Member States responsible for the airspace defined in Part B of that Annex have already been provided with a longer period to implement the required DLS ground infrastructure. Therefore it is no longer justified to differentiate, in terms of dates of application, between airspace defined in Parts A and B of that Annex.
(10) In addition, the date by which the operators are required to ensure that the aircraft concerned have the capacity to operate the DLS in accordance with Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 should be adjusted, in order that it corresponds to the amended date of application of that Regulation. Moreover, in respect of this requirement concerning the capacity to operate the DLS, it is also no longer justified to distinguish between aircraft on the basis of the date of their individual certificate of airworthiness. However, the exemptions to this requirement for certain categories of aircraft, as well as the specific rule concerning new transport type State aircraft, should be retained and the relevant dates should be adjusted accordingly, so as to retain the practical effect of those rules. Only with respect to the exemption relating to aircraft with an individual certificate of airworthiness first issued before 1 January 2014 and fitted with data link equipment certified against one of the relevant Eurocae documents the current dates should be retained, at least for the time being, in the absence of clear and convincing data justifying their adjustment.
(11) The measures set out in this Regulation, in particular the amendment to the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 29/2009, are, subject to the need to adequately address any aviation safety issues that may arise in this connection, without prejudice to the existing possibilities in the context of the modulation of air navigation charges referred to in Article 16 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 391/2013 (5) or the allocation of air traffic flow management (ATFM) slots in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 255/2010 (6) to take account of the fact that certain operators may already have equipped, or will equip on a voluntary basis before the amended date of application of the Regulation, their aircraft with the capacity to operate DLS and that certain air traffic service providers have already implemented DLS ground infrastructure.
(12) Pursuant to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 441/2014 (7), the Croatian airspace is to be added to the airspace in which Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 applies. However, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 441/2014 only applies from 5 February 2016. Considering the current amendment to Regulation (EC) No 29/2009, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 441/2014 should, for reasons of clarity, be repealed and the amendment enacted by that Regulation should be inserted in this Regulation.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 29/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 5(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For gibberellic acid maximum residue levels (MRLs) were set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005. For Phlebiopsis gigantea, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus strain FE 9901, Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus, Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus, Bacillus firmus I-1582, orange oil, s-abscisic acid, L-ascorbic acid and Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus, no specific MRLs were set nor were the substances included in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, so the default value of 0,01 mg/kg laid down in Article 18(1)(b) of that Regulation applies'.
(2) As regards Phlebiopsis gigantea
 (2), Paecilomyces fumosoroseus strain FE 9901 (3), Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus (4), Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus (5), Bacillus firmus I-1582 (6) and Helicoverpa armigera nucleopolyhedrovirus (7) the European Food Safety Authority, (the Authority) concluded that these substances are not pathogenic to humans and do not require a quantitative consumer risk assessment. In view of that conclusion, the Commission considers that the inclusion of such substances in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is appropriate.
(3) For orange oil (8), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required. Orange oil is naturally occurring in plants and is used as a flavouring agent for medicine and food. In view of this it is considered appropriate to include this substance temporarily in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 pending submission of EFSA's reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 12(1).
(4) For gibberellic acid (9), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required. Gibberellic acid is naturally occurring in a wide range of plants. The Authority did not propose MRLs for grapes as residues were shown to be below the LOQ in treated and control samples and since it would not be possible to distinguish between exogenous and natural occurring gibberellins. In view of these reasons it is considered appropriate to include this substance temporarily in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 pending submission of EFSA's reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 12(1).
(5) For s-abscisic acid (10), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required. S-abscisic acid is naturally occurring in plants. In view of this it is considered appropriate to include this substance temporarily in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 pending submission of EFSA's reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 12(1).
(6) As regards L-ascorbic acid, the Authority concluded (11) that its inclusion in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is appropriate.
(7) Based on the scientific opinion and conclusions of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the appropriate modifications to the MRLs fulfil the relevant requirements of Article 5(1) and Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

In view of that conclusion, the Commission considers that the inclusion of such substances in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 is appropriate.\n\n((3)) For orange oil(8), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required. Orange oil is naturally occurring in plants and is used as a flavouring agent for medicine and food. In view of this it is considered appropriate to include this substance temporarily in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 pending submission of EFSA's reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 12(1).\n\n((4)) For gibberellic acid(9), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required. Gibberellic acid is naturally occurring in a wide range of plants. The Authority did not propose MRLs for grapes as residues were shown to be below the LOQ in treated and control samples and since it would not be possible to distinguish between exogenous and natural occurring gibberellins. In view of these reasons it is considered appropriate to include this substance temporarily in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 pending submission of EFSA's reasoned opinion in accordance with Article 12(1).\n\n((5)) For s-abscisic acid(10), the Authority could not conclude on the dietary risk assessment for consumers as some information was not available and further consideration by risk managers was required.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 22 June 1993 terminating the proceeding to review anti-dumping measures applicable to certain imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China
(93/377/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 14 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A . PREVIOUS PROCEDURE  (1) By Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters falling within CD code ex 9613 10 00 and originating, inter  alia, in the People's Republic of China. The rate applicable to products originating from that country was set at 16,9 %.
B. REVIEW  (2) In January, the Commission received submissions from Policity Industrial Ltd, Capital Industries Ltd and Gladstrong Investments Ltd (companies incorporated in Hong Kong and participants in joint-venture manufacturing operations in the  People's Republic of China) and from Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemcials Co., Ltd (a company introducing itself as being located in the People's Republic of China), manufacturers of the product in question, stating their intention to export the product  concerned from China to the Community in the near future and requesting the establishing of individual anti-dumping duty rates for their exports.
Those companies provided, on request, evidence that they did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period covered by the previous investigation into dumping (calendar year 1989), and that they were not related to or associated  with the Chinese export branches or other Chinese manufacturers of this product for which dumping was found during the original investigation period. One of the companies started exporting to the Community after the end of the investigation period.
(3) By a notice published on 11 March 1992 (3) the Community, after consultation within the Advisory Committee and in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, initiated a review of Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 in so far as it concerned  imports of pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China.
(4) Accordingly, the Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerend, as well as the representatives of the exporting country. It sent questionnaires to the parties directly concerend and gave them the opportunity to make  known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(5) Neither Policity Industrial Ltd, one of the exporters having requested the review, nor four producers in China, alleged to be potential exporters to the Community, replied to the questionnaire sent to them by the Commission. The other three  companies having requested the review, as well as three Chinese producers related to them, replied to the questionnaire.
(6) One of the companies having solicited the review requested and was granted a hearing. The Commission informed all the companies having cooperated in the review proceeding of the results of the investigation and the Commission's considerations in  this respect. The Commission also granted these companies a period within which to submit further comments and their comments were taken into consideration where appropriate.
(7) The investigation period for the review was calendar year 1991.
C. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION  (8) The Commission considered it necessary to examine whether the exporters having requested the review are companies which are independent of the Chinese State in reaching their business decisions. This would  distinguish the exporters from those exporters subject of the original investigation and would entitle them to individual treatment.
According to the consistent practice of the Community with regard to exports from a non-market economy country, that individual treatment is appropriate only in exceptional cases where the producer concerned has shown that its business decisions are  taken independently of the State authorities. In this connection, the sole fact that a company has the status of a joint venture, with a shareholding by a foreign investor, has not as such been considered sufficient by the Community to justify  individual treatment.
Indeed, individual dumping margins or anti-dumping duties are inappropriate when the State, through any form of control on the exporters concerned, can take advantage of differentiation of the anti-dumping duty and thus undermine the effectiveness of  the measures taken.
In examining whether this requirement is met, the Commission found the following:
1. Policity Industrial Ltd, Hong Kong
(9) Neither Policity Industrial Ltd, Hong Kong, nor its allegedly relate company in China, Dongguan Poly Action Plastics &  Metal Mfg Co Ltd, submitted any information concerning their business activities to the Commission. It could not therefore be  established whether the Chinese company operated outside the influence of the State authorities. No evidence of changed circumstances could therefore be found.
2. Capital Line Industries Ltd, Hong Kong
(10) From the information made available to the Commission by the company, it appeared that Capital Line Industries Ltd, Hong Kong, holds 30 % of the capital of the Chinese producer Dong Guan Lighter Factory, the remaining 70 % of shares being owned by  Chinese State-owned companies.
(11) The fact that State-owned companies have the majority shareholding in the Chinese manufacturer of lighters led the Commission to conclude that the Dong Guan Lighter Factory could not be considered an independent company operating outside the  influence of the State authorities.
3. Gladstrong Investments Ltd, Hong Kong
(12) From the data submitted by the company, it appeared that Gladstrong Investments Ltd, Hong Kong, is a participent in four joint-venture manufacturing operations in the People's Republic of China. While Gladstrong holds directly or indirectly a  maximum of 40 % of the capital of those companies, it appeared that the remaining capital (at least 60 %), was controlled by companies in which State authorities held the majority of shares.
(13) The Commission therefore considered that none of the four Chinese producers with which Gladstrong Investments Ltd, Hong Kong, was associated could be considered an independent company free of State control.
4. Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd, Hong Kong
(14) From the information made available to the Commission by the company, it appeared that Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd is in fact located in Hong Kong and is 50 % and is 50 % owned by a Hong Kong company and 50 % by a company which  itself is 100 % owned by the State of the People's Republic of China.
The supplier of Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd, Hong Kong, is a producer in China called 'Guang Dong Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd' whose stock is shared equally (50-50) between the same companies which own Sanshui Huafa  Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd, Hong Kong.
(15) The fact that Guang Dong Sanshui Huafa Industry &  Chemicals Co., Ltd is 50 % owned by a State controlled company in China means that the State authorities are able to block the business decisions of the company and thus exercise a significant  degree of control.
5. Conclusion
(16) For the reasons given above, no individual treatment can be granted to any of the Chinese companies involved in the review.
(17) One company submitted an offer of undertaking. However, since individual treatment is not appropriate for that company, the offer could not be considered.
D. TERMINATION OF REVIEW PROCEEDING  (18) In those circumstances, the proceeding to review the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to certain imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China  should be terminated without any change to the measures in force.
(19) No objections to this course of action were raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': ""93/377/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 June 1993 terminating the proceeding to review anti-dumping measures applicable to certain imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China""}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements (1), and in particular Article 36(4) of Annex II thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 17 July 2008 the Commission adopted Decision 2008/603/EC (2) granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Mauritius with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins. By Commission Implementing Decision 2011/377/EU (3) extension of that temporary derogation was granted until 31 December 2011. On 6 October 2011 Mauritius requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information received from Mauritius the catches of raw tuna remain unusually low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged and because of the problem of piracy in the Indian Ocean a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2012.
(2) On 14 August 2008 the Commission adopted Decision 2008/691/EC (4) granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Seychelles with regard to preserved tuna. By Implementing Decision 2011/377/EU extension of that temporary derogation was granted until 31 December 2011. On 17 November 2011 Seychelles requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to the information provided by Seychelles the catches of raw tuna remain very low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. Furthermore, the threat of piracy results in a reduced number of fishing days in lucrative but high risk areas. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged, a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2012.
(3) On 18 September 2008 the Commission adopted Decision 2008/751/EC (5) granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Madagascar with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins. By Implementing Decision 2011/377/EU extension of that temporary derogation was granted until 31 December 2011. On 25 October 2011 Madagascar requested in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex. According to this information sourcing of raw originating tuna remains difficult due to the problem of piracy in the Indian Ocean. Given that the abnormal situation since 2008 remains unchanged, a new derogation should be granted with effect from 1 January 2012.
(4) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC applied until 31 December 2011. It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the ACP countries to the Union as well as a smooth transition to the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between the Eastern and Southern Africa States on the one part and the European Community and its Member States on the other part (ESA-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement). Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be extended from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012.
(5) It would be inappropriate to grant derogations in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota granted to the ESA region under the ESA-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement. Consequently the quota amounts for 2012 should be set at 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 600 tonnes of tuna loins for Mauritius, 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 600 tonnes of tuna loins for Seychelles and 2 000 tonnes of preserved tuna and 500 tonnes of tuna loins for Madagascar.
(6) In the interest of clarity, it is appropriate to set out explicitly that the only non-originating materials to be used for the manufacture of preserved tuna and tuna loins of CN code 1604 14 16 should be tuna of HS Headings 0302 or 0303, in order for the preserved tuna and tuna loins to benefit from the derogation.
(7) Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '12.4.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 102/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 4 April 2012\namending Decisions 2008/603/EC, 2008/691/EC and 2008/751/EC as regards the temporary derogations from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Mauritius, Seychelles and Madagascar with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins\n(notified under document C(2012) 2321)\n(2012/190/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 17 July 2008 the Commission adopted Decision 2008/603/EC(2)granting a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Mauritius with regard to preserved tuna and tuna loins.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 144(1) and Article 148, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 (2) opened on a multiannual basis an autonomous import tariff quota for the import of 20 000 tonnes of high-quality beef. That Regulation has been amended by Regulation (EU) No 464/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) which increases the import tariff quota to 21 500 tonnes from the first day of the month following its publication, and to 48 200 tonnes as from 1 August 2012. Tariff quotas for agricultural products are to be managed in conformity with Article 144(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 464/2012 provides that the tariff quota is to be managed by the Commission by means of implementing acts, to be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers (4).
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 620/2009 of 13 July 2009 providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for high-quality beef (5) lays down rules for the administration of the tariff quota concerned by applying the simultaneous examination method of import licence applications, as referred to in Article 144(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Recent experience with the administration of the Union tariff quota for high-quality beef has shown a need to improve the management of this tariff quota. Experience in the use of the first-come, first-served management system referred to in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 has been positive in other agricultural sectors. Therefore, in the interest of administrative simplification and in order to avoid any speculative behaviour, the tariff quota concerning the import of high-quality beef originating in third countries should be managed in accordance with Articles 308a and 308b and Article 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6), which lays down rules for the management of tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of acceptance of customs declarations. Where imports are managed in accordance with those rules, no import licences should be required any more.
(3) In order to ensure a regular flow of imports, it is appropriate to sub-divide the annual tariff quota into quarterly sub-periods. Appropriate order numbers should be fixed in line with Article 308a(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 establishes that the quota year runs from 1 July to 30 June. In order to ensure a swift transfer from the current simultaneous examination method to the first-come, first-served management system the new management method should apply as from 1 July 2012.
(5) The quantity available for the first quarterly sub-period (1 July to 30 September 2012) should be calculated on a pro-rata basis taking into account the volume of the annual tariff quota applicable until 31 July 2012 and the new increased volume of the annual tariff quota applicable as of 1 August 2012.
(6) The release into free circulation of the goods imported under the tariff quota opened by Regulation (EC) No 617/2009 should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity issued by the competent authority of the exporting third country. The issue of such certificates of authenticity should guarantee that the imported goods qualify as high quality beef as defined in this Regulation.
(7) For reasons of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 620/2009 should be repealed and replaced by a new implementing regulation.
(8) Since the new management system is to apply as from 1 July 2012, licences applied for in June 2012 under Regulation (EC) No 620/2009 should not be issued.
(9) The Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its Chair,","{'header': '8.6.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 148/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 481/2012\nof 7 June 2012\nlaying down rules for the management of a tariff quota for high-quality beef', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EC) No 617/2009(2)opened on a multiannual basis an autonomous import tariff quota for the import of 20\xa0000 tonnes of high-quality beef.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

It may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.\n\n((9)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 26 January 2007.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nto Commission Regulation of 25 January 2007 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nRefunds\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa020\xa010\xa09400\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa020\xa090\xa09200\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa010\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1102\xa090\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa040\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09300\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa010\xa09500\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa013\xa090\xa09100\n(\n1\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa019\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa060\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1103\xa020\xa020\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa069\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa012\xa090\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09110\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa019\xa050\xa09130\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa001\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa003\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa005\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa020\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa022\xa030\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa023\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa051\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa029\xa055\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa010\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1104\xa030\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1107\xa010\xa011\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1107\xa010\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa011\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa012\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa013\xa000\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09200\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1108\xa019\xa010\xa09300\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1109\xa000\xa000\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa051\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa059\xa09000\n(\n2\n)\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa091\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa030\xa099\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa040\xa090\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09100\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa090\xa050\xa09900\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa090\xa075\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n1702\xa090\xa079\xa09000\nC10\nEUR/t\n0,00\n2106\xa090\xa055\xa09000\nC14\nEUR/t\n0,00\nNB:\nThe product codes and the ‘A ’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n) as amended.\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are as follows:\nC10\n:\nAll destinations\nC14\n:\nAll destinations except for Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n(\n1\n)\nNo refund shall be granted on products given a heat treatment resulting in pregelatinisation of the starch.\n(\n2\n)\nRefunds are granted in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 2730/75 (\nOJ L 281, 1.11.1975, p. 20\n), as amended.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In conformity with Decision 91/666/EEC, the purchase of antigens is a part of the Community action to establish Community reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines.
(2) Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC details the quantities and subtypes of antigen of the foot-and-mouth disease virus to be stored in Community antigen reserves.
(3) Forced by the epidemiological situation and following the advice of the World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, Pirbright, United Kingdom, and the advice of an expert group established to review certain provisions of Directive 85/511/EEC(5), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, the Community has made purchases of subtypes and quantities of foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.
(4) By Commission Decision 93/590/EC of 5 November 1993 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines(6), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC(7), arrangements were made for purchase of A5, A22 and O1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.
(5) By Commission Decision 97/348/EC of 23 May 1997 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(8), as last amended by Decision 2000/112/EC, arrangements were made for the purchase of A22-Iraq, C1 and ASIA1 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigens.
(6) By Commission Decision 2000/77/EC of 17 December 1999 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(9), arrangements were made for purchase of certain quantities of A Iran 96, A Iran 99, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.
(7) By Commission Decision 2000/569/EC of 8 September 2000 for the purchase by the Community of foot-and-mouth disease antigens and for the formulation, production, bottling and distribution of vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease(10), arrangements were made for purchase of additional quantities of A22-Iraq, O1-Manisa, ASIA 1-Shamir, A Malaysia 97, SAT 1, SAT 2 (East African and Southern African strains) and SAT 3 foot-and-mouth disease virus antigen.
(8) It appears necessary to align Annex I to Decision 91/666/EEC to the purchases made by the Community in the light of the epidemiological development.
(9) It appears also appropriate to update the Annex to Decision 2000/112/EC detailing the distribution between antigen banks of antigen reserves established within the framework of the Community action concerning reserves of foot-and-mouth disease vaccines and amending Decisions 93/590/EC and 97/348/EC.

The decision was notified to CSM on 12 December 1990. In the body  of the decision it was explained that the verification was ordered because the Commission had been informed of allegations that NV Centrale Suiker Maastschappij had participated in arrangements or concerted practices with certain other Community  producers concerning the marketing of sugar.
The Commission officials charged with the investigation began carrying it out immediately after the decision had been notified. This included examination of the 12 documents specified in Annex I (3). The Commission officials intended to take copies of  those documents which related to the exchange of information between CSM and Suiker Unie concerning the purchasing of sugar beet, as well as the passing on of information eminating from Tiense Suikerraffinaderij NV which involved its purchase prices for  sugar beet. However, CSM prevented them from doing so. It stated that it was not prepared to give copies of the documents in question because it could not reasonably be argued that the documents could prove any fact covered by the subject matter of the  investigation, as specified in the written authorization presented by the abovementioned Commission officials.
The Commission officials took minutes of the above. These were signed by CSM. Extracts from the documents allowing only their identification were annexed to the minutes.
The investigation was continued on the following day, 13 December 1990. In the course of that day, CSM stated that it was now prepared to allow copies to be taken of four of the abovementioned 12 documents. It stated that it had been mistaken about the  content of the four documents. The Commission officials took copies of them and confirmed this in writing (Annex II to this Decision) (3).
On 19 May 1991 the Commission decided to initiate a proceeding against CSM pursuant to Regulation No 17. On 13 June 1991 a decision was adopted pursuant to Article 16 (1) of Regulation No 17 imposing a periodic penalty payment on CSM and a statement of  objections sent in the context of the abovementioned proceeding.
On 14 June 1991, as a result of the Commission Decision imposing a periodic penalty payment, CSM declared its readiness, although protesting that it had no choice, to allow the Commission to make copies of the documents referred to in Annex I to the  Decision and not included in Annex II.
These copies were made at the offices of CSM on 2 July 1991.
On 12 July 1991 the Commission received a reply under the abovementioned proceeding. CSM declined a hearing.
(2) By letter of 21 December 1990 CSM asked the Commission to return the copy of a business document concerning sugar-beet prices which the Commission officials had taken during the investigation. The grounds advanced for the request were the same as  those given in the statement recorded in the abovementioned minutes.
The Commission provisionally refused this request since the inquiries in the proceeding which led to the investigation at the premises of CSM have not yet been completed. It could not, consequently, be established with certainty that the document was  not relevant to the investigation. In any case, the document is not, according to the Commission, one that is obviously not related to the subject matter of the investigation as specified in the decision of 6 December 1990.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
1. Article 14 of Regulation No 17
Pursuant to Article 14 of Regulation No 17, the Commission may, in carrying out the duties assigned to it by Article 89 and by provisions adopted pursuant to Article 87 of the Treaty, undertake all necessary investigations into undertakings. To this  end, the officials authorized by the Commission are empowered, inter alia, to examine the books and other business records of the undertaking and to take copies of or extracts from these books and business records.
Pursuant to Article 14 (3) of the same Regulation, undertakings are required to submit to investigations ordered by decision of the Commission.
The decision of 6 December 1990 requires CSM to allow the Commission officials charged with the investigation to examine the business records specified by them and to take copies of such business records. CSM failed to comply with this requirement in  respect of all of the documents listed in Annex I.
The fact that, in the case of the documents in Annex II, on the second day of the investigations, and in the case of the other documents, after receiving the Commission Decision imposing periodic penalty payments, CSM nevertheless allowed the Commission  to take the necessary copies where it had previously refused to let it do so, has no bearing on this infringement. The obligation incumbent on an undertaking to submit to an investigation ordered by a decision adopted pursuant to Article 14 (3) of  Regulation No 17 is not satisfied even if the undertaking's refusal to let officials charged with the investigation by the Commission to exercise their powers is only temporary. Any other interpretation would jeopardize the effectiveness of the  investigation.
CSM's view that the documents in question cannot prove any facts covered by the subject matter of the investigation, as specified in the Commission's decision of 6 December 1990, is unacceptable. It cannot be deduced either from Article 14 of Regulation  No 17 of from the abovementioned Commission decision that the undertaking's obligation to cooperate in the investigation is limited to supplying such documents as it considers relevant. It has consistently been held in the case law of the Court of  Justice of the European Communities that it is for the Commission to determine which business records must be presented for examination and from which any copies of extracts are to be taken (Cases 155/79, AM&  S v. Commission (1) and 46/87, Hoechst v.  Commission (2); confirmed, with regard to requests for information under Article 11 of Regulation No 17, by Case 374/87, Orkem v. Commission (3)).
CSM however considers that an undertaking's obligation to cooperate in an investigation is limited by the subject matter and purpose of the investigation as defined in the Commission decision. CSM concludes that it is up to the undertakings themselves  to judge the extent to which they are required to cooperate. Both of these positions are supported, in CSM's view, by the abovementioned Hoechst judgment.
The Commission does not call into question that in the first instance it is up to the company itself to assess its rights in the framework of a verification in the case of dispute. However, at issue is the question how an undertaking should assert its  rights. The answer is that the undertaking cannot take matters into its own hands but must apply to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities, which alone is competent to supervise the Commission's conduct.
Of course, the Commission officials charged with the investigation have only such powers as are specified in Article 14 of Regulation No 17 and in the investigation decision. They are under an obligation not to examine business records, or to stop  examining such records, if they are obviously or in the Commission officials' opinion not related to the subject matter of the investigation.
However, such documents are not, in the Commission's opinion, involved in this instance. Nor does CSM's minuted statement justifying its refusal to have copies taken, provide any evidence that the relevant documents are obviously not related to the  subject matter of the investigation as specified in the decision of 6 December 1990. The exchange of information concerning the purchasing of sugar beet, which is itself a major component in the cost price of the final product, could, by virtue of  Commission Decision 82/895/EEC (4) in Case UGAL/BNIC, constitute an infringement of the competition rules of the EEC Treaty in relation to the marketing of sugar.
However, only the Court of First Instance of the European Communities is entitled to review the lawfulness of an investigation decision and of the associated actions by the Commission officials charged with the investigation. If those officials take  copies of or extracts from business records which, in the opinion of the undertaking concerned, are not related to the subject matter of the investigation, the undertaking can ask the Commission to return the copies or extracts taken. The undertaking is  also able to apply to have the investigation decision declared void. At all events, the Commission is not allowed to make use of evidence which it acquired on the basis of an unlawful investigation decision or outside the scope of any such decision  (orders of the President of the Court of Justice of 26 March and 28 October 1987 in Cases 46/87R (5) and 85/87R (6)).
2. Article 15 of Regulation No 17
Pursuant to Article 15 (1) (c) of Regulation No 17, the Commission may by decision impose on an undertaking a fine of from 100 to 5 000 units of account where, intentionally or negligently, the undertaking refuses to submit to an investigation ordered  by decision issued in implementation of Article 14 (3).
CSM has not submitted, within the meaning of that provision, to the investigation ordered by the Commission by decision of 6 December 1990, since it prevented the Commission officials charged with the investigation (as explained above) from taking  copies of the documents referred to in Annex I.
Consequently, the Commission considers that there are grounds for imposing a fine on CSM. In setting the amount of this fine, account is taken of the fact that, on the second day of the investigation, CSM at its own initiative allowed the Commission  officials to take copies of the four documents referred to in Annex II. It is therefore assumed that in respect of these documents the infringement of Article 14 of Regulation No 17 occured through negligence. Moreover, it cannot be disputed that CSM  otherwise cooperated in the investigation. On the other hand, CSM intentionally prevented copies of the other documents from being taken, and allowed such copies to be taken only when threatened with the imposition of periodic penalty payments. Even if  CSM had been mistaken about the content and extent of its obligations, in respect of these further documents there can be no question of negligence since CSM acted in full knowledge of all relevant facts,","{'title': '92/500/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 October 1992 imposing a fine pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Council Regulation No 17 on CSM NV (Case IV/33.791 - CSM - ex IV/33.638 - Sugar) (Only the Dutch text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nCSM NV failed to submit fully to the investigation ordered by the Commision in its decision of 6 December 1990 adopted pursuant to Article 14 (3) of Regulation No 17 by temporarily preventing the taking of copies of the documents specified in  Annex I.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nA fine of ECU 3 000 is hereby imposed on CSM NV.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe fine imposed by Article 2 shall be paid, within three months of notification of this Decision, to the following bank account:\n\nNo 310-0933000-43,\n\nBanque Bruxelles Lambert,\n\nAgence européenne,\n\nRond-Point Schuman 5,\n\nB-1040 Brussels.\n\nAfter the expiry of that period, interest shall be automatically payable at the rate charged by the European Monetary Cooperation Fund for transactions in ecus on the first working day of the month in which this Decision was adopted, plus 3,5 %  percentage points, i.e. 14,25 %.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to:\n\nCSM NV,\n\nNienoord 13,\n\nNl-1112 XE Diemen.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC (1), and in particular Article 14(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The United Kingdom notified its intention to grant an approval derogating from the common aviation safety rules contained in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (2). Pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the Commission assessed the need for, and the level of protection emerging from, the proposed derogation, based on the recommendation from the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘the Agency’).
(2) The proposed derogation, notified by the United Kingdom on 2 August 2013, concerns the conversion of the existing national licences for sailplane pilots, set out in Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011. The United Kingdom argued that the derogation is needed so that the holder of any non-statutory qualification document issued by the British Gliding Association (BGA) may be credited with compliance with the relevant parts of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011, in accordance with the conversion report that has been developed in consultation with the Agency in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011. The derogation would enable the United Kingdom to issue equivalent Part-FCL LAPL(S) or SPL licences and instructor and examiner certificates to the holders of such qualification documents.
(3) The United Kingdom also gave reasons demonstrating that an equivalent level of protection would be achieved should the proposed derogation be granted. Based on the recommendation from the Agency, issued on 8 October 2013, the Commission concluded that the proposed derogation would provide a level of protection equivalent to the one attained by application of the common aviation safety rules, provided certain conditions are met.
(4) In accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, a decision by the Commission that a Member State may grant a proposed derogation needs to be notified to all Member States, which would also be entitled to apply the measure in question. This Decision should therefore be addressed to all Member States. The description of the derogation, as well as the conditions attached to it, should be such as to enable other Member States to also apply that measure when they are in the same situation, without requiring a further decision by the Commission.

(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Aviation Safety Agency Committee,","{'header': '3.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 196/35', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 1 July 2014\nauthorising the United Kingdom to derogate from certain common aviation safety rules pursuant to Article 14(6) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2014)\xa04355)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/426/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The United Kingdom notified its intention to grant an approval derogating from the common aviation safety rules contained in Commission Regulation (EU) No\xa01178/2011(2). Pursuant to Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0216/2008, the Commission assessed the need for, and the level of protection emerging from, the proposed derogation, based on the recommendation from the European Aviation Safety Agency (‘the Agency’).\n\n((2)) The proposed derogation, notified by the United Kingdom on 2 August 2013, concerns the conversion of the existing national licences for sailplane pilots, set out in Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01178/2011. The United Kingdom argued that the derogation is needed so that the holder of any non-statutory qualification document issued by the British Gliding Association (BGA) may be credited with compliance with the relevant parts of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No\xa01178/2011, in accordance with the conversion report that has been developed in consultation with the Agency in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No\xa01178/2011. The derogation would enable the United Kingdom to issue equivalent Part-FCL LAPL(S) or SPL licences and instructor and examiner certificates to the holders of such qualification documents.\n\n((3)) The United Kingdom also gave reasons demonstrating that an equivalent level of protection would be achieved should the proposed derogation be granted. Based on the recommendation from the Agency, issued on 8\xa0October 2013, the Commission concluded that the proposed derogation would provide a level of protection equivalent to the one attained by application of the common aviation safety rules, provided certain conditions are\xa0met.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 14(7) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0216/2008, a decision by the Commission that a Member State may grant a proposed derogation needs to be notified to all Member States, which would also be entitled to apply the measure in question. This Decision should therefore be addressed to all Member States. The description of the derogation, as well as the conditions attached to it, should be such as to enable other Member States to also apply that measure when they are in the same situation, without requiring a further decision by the Commission. For these purposes, considering that the aforementioned conversion report is not publicly available, the United Kingdom should make it available to the other Member States upon their request. In addition, the Member States should exchange information on the application of this measure where they apply it, in accordance with Article 15(1) of Regulation (EC) No\xa0216/2008, as this application may have effects outside the Member States that grant the derogation.\n\n((5)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Aviation Safety Agency Committee,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe United Kingdom may grant approvals derogating from Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01178/2011 and instead apply the rules laid down in section 1 of the Annex to this Decision, provided that conditions specified in section 2 of that Annex are complied with.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nAll Member States shall be entitled to apply the measure referred to in Article 1.

(5) According to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, upon the receipt from regional fisheries management organisations of the lists of fishing vessels presumed or confirmed to be involved in the IUU fishing, the Commission shall update the Union list.
(6) The Commission has received the updated lists from the regional fisheries management organisations.

(8) The vessel the ‘RED’, which was on the lists established or amended by Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 and Implementing Regulations (EU) No 724/2011, (EU) No 1234/2012 and (EU) No 672/2013, has been removed from their list by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) on 14 November 2012, by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) on 21 December 2012 and by the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (SEAFO) at its Compliance Committee Meeting of 11 December 2013. This vessel should be considered as removed from the Union list as of 11 December 2013.
(9) Considering that the same vessel might be listed under different names and/or flags depending on the time of its inclusion on the regional fisheries management organisations lists, the updated Union list should include the different names and/or flags as established by the respective regional fisheries management organisations.
(10) Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n\n((7)) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments as provided for in the said Article 93, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
Following a number of complaints from federations of firms in the synthetic fibre and textile sectors, the Commission, by letters of 26 July 1983 and 3 November 1983, requested information from the Belgian Government in respect of an alleged aid granted to a Belgian textile company for the production of polypropylene fibre and yarn.
By letter dated 18 November 1983, the Belgian Government informed the Commission that in March 1983 an aid had been granted to the largest Belgian textile and carpet group for the purpose of establishing a production plant for polypropylene staple fibre and filament yarn.
According to the Belgian authorities the aid had been granted under the transitional period of three months authorized by the Commission until the end of March 1983 for the 1982 aid programme in favour of the textile and clothing industry. The Commission also was informed that the aid amounted to Bfrs 224 million and took the form of a State participation in the capital of the subsidiary created by the textile and carpet group for the abovementioned purpose. Finally, the Belgian Governmemt indicated that this aid was the only intervention under the 1982 textile programme in favour of the textile and carpet group in question.
By telex dated 5 December 1983 the Commission requested additional information. Partial replies were communicated orally on 20 December 1983 and 11 January 1984.
Having examined the case, the Commission considered that the aid would be incompatible with the common market on the grounds that it would affect trade between Member States to an extent contrary to the common interest. The Commission also considered that in view of the overcapacities in polypropylene staple fibre and filament yarn the creation of any additional capacities should not be encouraged with State aid.
Furthermore, the Commission considered that the aid should have been notified to it in advance under the transitional period authorized for the 1982 textile-aid programme and that neither the textile and carpet group nor its subsidiary concerned were registered on the list of firms submitted to the Commission for the purpose of monitoring the application of the transitional period.
Consequently, the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in the first paragraph of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the aid and by letter of 13 February 1984 gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments.
II
The Belgian Government, in submitting by letter dated 13 March 1984 its comments under the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2), did not question the aid character of the intervention and pointed out that State participation reached only 18 % of total investment cost, if including the working capital required for the project in total investment costs. It argued that no advance notification had been required as the project, while being undertaken by a carpet producer, concerned synthetic fibre and yarn and thus products not subject to this notification procedure. Furthermore, it considered that the firm in question had been listed on the document sent to the Commission for the purpose of monitoring the application of the transitional period under the name of the principal owner of the textile and carpet group and his commercial domicile. The Belgian Government also disputed the overcapacity problems in the production of polypropylene fibre and yarn highlighted by the Commission.
The comments of two other Member States, seven federations of firms in the sector and four individual companies, submitted to the Commission under the Article 93 (2) procedure, supported the Commission's view and underlined the overcapacity problems which the polypropylene sector is facing. They highlighted the sensitivity of the sector because of the volume of trade and the degree of competition between Member States. It was also claimed that the aid gave an unfair advantage to the carpet and synthetic-fibre producer in question in competition with other Community manufacturers.
III
The acquisition of shareholdings in companies either by central governments or by public agencies under government authority may in certain cases constitute aid under Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
The State intervention in question is explicitly referred to by the Belgian Government as a State aid.
In polypropylene staple fibre and filament yarn there is a high volume of trade and a large degree of competition between Member States. Consequently, trade between Member States is affected by an intervention undertaken by a Member State.
In these circumstances the operation in question constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty lays down the principle that aid having the features there described is incompatible with the common market. The exceptions to this principle set out in Article 92 (3) specify objectives in the Community interest transcending the interests of the aid recipient. These exceptions must be construed narrowly when any regional or industry-aid scheme or any individual award under a general aid scheme is scrutinized. In particular they may be applied only when the Commission is satisfied that the free play of market forces alone, without the aid, would not induce the prospective aid recipient to adopt a course of action contributing to attainment of one of the said objectives.
To apply the exceptions to cases not contributing to such an objective would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.
In applying these principles in its scrutiny of individual aid awards, the Commission must satisfy itself that the aid is justified by the contribution the recipient is making to attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3), and is necessary to that end. Where this cannot be demonstrated, and especially where the aided investment would take place in any case, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to attainment of the objectives specified in the exceptions but merely serves to bolster the financial position of the recipient firm.
The recipient in the present case cannot be said to be making such a contribution in return for the aid.
The Belgian Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the planned aid falls within one of the categories of exceptions in Article 92 (3).
With regard to the exceptions provided for by Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aids which promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, the area in which the recipient undertaking's factory is located is not one where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (a), nor does the award appear likely to facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (c), a purpose, moreover, for which it is not intended.
As far as the exceptions in Article 92 (3) (b) are concerned, the measure does not have the feature of a 'project of common European interest' or of a project likely 'to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State', the promotion of which justifies application of this exception clause. Although the economy of Belgium faces social and economic difficulties, these are not the most serious in the Community. In this situation the danger of an escalation of State aids is most immediate and any State aid is most likely to affect trade between Member States.
As to the exceptions in Article 92 (3) (c), there is substantial overcapacity in both staple and filament yarn of polypropylene in the EEC. In 1983, as in the years before, capacity utilization is estimated to have been well below 70 %, which is insufficient for economically viable operation. In Belgium, moreover, the levels of utilization were much lower and stood at 50 % for staple fibre and only 40 % for filament yarn. Any artificial lowering of the establishment costs of a polypropylene plant would therefore weaken the competitive position of existing producers and would have the effect of reducing capacity utilization and depressing prices, to the detriment of, and possible withdrawal from the market of, producers which have hitherto survived owing to restructuring and productivity improvements undertaken from their own resources.
Since polypropylene staple fibre and filament yarn are traded predominantly within the Community, it is unquestionable that the aid would have an adverse effect on trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, especially as the aid was granted to a firm which is part of the largest single carpet producer in Belgium, and indeed the Community, which exports a very large percentage of its production to the other Member States.
Polypropylene filament yarn is the basic raw material of carpet production. It represents up to 60 % of the production costs of the final product. Assistance for the production of raw materials which are key inputs in producing a final product will considerably affect the costing of and profit margins on the final product. The aid, while having been granted for polypropylene production, must be regarded as directly favouring the manufacture of carpets of the group in question.
The aid in question favours a project under which production capacities for polypropylene fibres and yarn are to be expanded significantly. Under the 1971 and 1977 guidelines for textile and clothing industry aids, established by the Commission in cooperation with Member States, such projects should, in view of the sensitivity of the textile and clothing sector in general, not be supported with public finance. Furthermore, in a sector as sensitive as carpets and tufted carpets and in which the Belgian industry is already a high performer and competitive, an aid for such a purpose would not be in the common interest, particularly as it was granted in favour of the already by far largest Belgian textile firm. Any aid granted for such a purpose would serve only to increase the financial strength of the undertaking in question, giving it an unfair advantage in competition with other Community producers.
In the carpet market, polypropylene and nylon compete with each other. Like polypropylene, nylon has been in a state of severe oversupply in the Community, and strenuous efforts have been made to reduce capacity. The State-aided expansion of polypropylene production in question will counteract these efforts and weaken the Community nylon sector.
It is concluded that the aid in question, in view of the absence of any justification on grounds of the Community interest and the fact that the industry is one in which competition within the Community is very keen, is liable to affect trade to an extent contrary to the common interest. Accordingly, there is no factor which could justify the Commission in exempting the aid from the rule that aids are incompatible with the common market by applying the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) of the EEC Treaty.
Therefore, the aid amounting to Bfrs 224 million which was granted in March 1983 in disregard of Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, which requires that a Member State shall notify the Commission in advance of any aid plans, must be withdrawn,","{'title': '84/508/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 June 1984 on the aid granted by the Belgian Government to a producer of polypropylene fibre and yarn (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty lays down the principle that aid having the features there described is incompatible with the common market.
