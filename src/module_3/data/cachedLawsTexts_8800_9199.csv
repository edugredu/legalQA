(2) Given the present situation on the market in milk and milk products, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) The second subparagraph of Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) In accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding between the European Community and the Dominican Republic on import protection for milk powder in the Dominican Republic (2) approved by Council Decision 98/486/EC (3), a certain amount of Community milk products exported to the Dominican Republic can benefit from reduced customs duties.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 (2) has set out a relatively short period for the control bodies and control authorities to send their application for recognition for the purpose of compliance in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. As there is no experience with the direct application of Union rules on organic production and labeling of organic products outside the territory of the Union, more time should be given to control bodies and control authorities wishing to request their inclusion in the list for the purpose of compliance.
(2) In accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 has established a list of third countries whose system of production and control measures for organic production of agricultural products are recognised as equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. In the light of a new application and information received by the Commission from third countries since the last publication of the list, certain modifications should be taken into consideration and the list should be adapted accordingly.
(3) Certain agricultural products imported from Canada are currently marketed in the Union pursuant to the transitional rules provided for in Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008. Canada submitted a request to the Commission to be included in the list provided for in Annex III to that Regulation. It submitted the information required pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 of that Regulation. The examination of this information and consequent discussion with the Canadian authorities have led to the conclusion that in that country the rules governing production and controls of agricultural products are equivalent to those laid down in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Commission has carried out an on-the-spot check of the rules of production and the control measures actually applied in Canada, as provided for in Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.
(4) The Costa Rican, Indian, Israeli, Japanese and Tunisian authorities have asked the Commission to include new control and certification bodies and have provided the Commission with the necessary guarantees that they meet the preconditions laid down in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008.
(5) The duration of inclusion of Costa Rica and New Zealand in the list provided for in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 expires on 30 June 2011. In order to avoid trade disruption, there is a need to prolong the inclusion of Costa Rica and New Zealand. In the light of the experience, the inclusion should be prolonged for an unlimited period.
(6) New Zealand transmitted editorial amendments to the relevant specifications provided in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 following the recent amalgamation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the New Zealand Food Safety Authority.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the regulatory Committee on organic production,","{'header': '21.6.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 161/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 590/2011\nof 20 June 2011\namending Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008, laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 as regards the arrangements for imports of organic products from third countries\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2008(2)has set out a relatively short period for the control bodies and control authorities to send their application for recognition for the purpose of compliance in accordance with Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission which has for this purpose consulted the Monetary Committee,
Whereas the French authorities have decided to put into effect an economic policy programme whose nature is such as to reduce the rate of inflation, to re-establish a sustainable balance of payments position and to ensure a better convergence of economic policies within the Community while respecting the obligations which flow from the Treaty; whereas they have presented this programme by way of support for their request;
Whereas this programme includes in particular the following measures:
1. Reduction of the public deficits, notably by setting a limit of 3 % of GDP to the budget deficits of 1983 and 1984, the re-establishment and preservation of equilibrium in the accounts of social security and unemployment insurance in 1983 and 1984 and a reduction in the deficits of the large national enterprises.
2. Reduction of the target for the rate of growth of the money supply for 1983 from 10 to 9 %, which will result in a marked reduction in the rate of domestic credit expansion.
3. Encouragement for the development of savings.
4. Perseverance with efforts to elimininate indexation both of costs and prices throughout the economy;
Whereas, without prejudice to the question of their compatibility with Community rules, the restrictions on the allocation of foreign currency for tourist purposes decided upon on 28 March 1983 will be abolished by 31 December 1983 at the latest in accordance with the programme presented by the French authorities;

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 521/77 (3) lays down detailed rules for applying protective measures in the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables;
Whereas quantities of cultivated mushrooms provisionally preserved, but unsuitable for consumption in that state, released for free circulation in the Community have increased since the beginning of 1990;
Whereas the levels of prices applying in the main third country supplying the Community for the 1990/91 marketing year are lower than those for similar products obtained in the Community; whereas it is accordingly difficult to market the latter;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2891/90 of 5 October 1990 on the issue of import licences for provisionally preserved cultivated mushrooms (4) fixes the maximum quantity of that product which may be released for free circulation in 1990; whereas  Regulations (EEC) No 3758/90 (5), (EEC) No 809/91 (6), (EEC) No 2162/91 (7), (EEC) No 3106/91 (8) and (EEC) No 3705/91 (9) on protective measures applicable to imports of provisionally preserved cultivated mushrooms have fixed a maximum quantity  respectively for the periods 1 January to 31 March 1991, 1 April to 31 July 1991, 1 August to 31 October 1991, 1 November to 31 December 1991 and 1 January to 29 February 1992;
Whereas there is a danger that from 1 March 1992 applications for import licences may be excessive in relation to actual requirements and may be submitted for speculative reasons pending the entry into force of new regulations on the tariff  classification of certain provisionally preserved mushrooms and the relevant adaptation of the import arrangements for the mushrooms in question; whereas this could create serious disturbances on the Community market, which could undermine the  objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas protective measures must therefore be applied from 1 March 1992;
Whereas the protective measures must be such as to prevent large-scale imports during a very limited period; whereas, to that end, taking into consideration the criteria laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 521/77 and pending the entry into force of the  abovementioned measures the quantities of the product in question which may be released for free circulation for a period of two months should be determined on the basis of the quantities imported during the same period in the preceding year and of a  rate of increase in line with the smooth development of trade;
Whereas, in order to ensure that the said quantity is properly used and to avoid the submission of applications for speculative reasons, the bulk of the quantity should be reserved for importers who in the past obtained supplies of provisionally  preserved cultivated mushrooms on the basis of the quantities they obtained in 1989, 1990 and 1991, while access to that quantity should be maintained for new importers;
Whereas, lastly, the additional rules necessary for the issue of the licences should be laid down; whereas such rules are complementary to or derogate from the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2405/89 of 1 August 1989 laying down special  detailed rules for the application of the system of import licences and advance fixing certificates for products processed from fruit and vegetables (10), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2641/91 (11),","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 440/92 of 25 February 1992 on a protective measure applicable to imports of provisionally preserved cultivated mushrooms', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 23 July 1984
concerning assistance by the United Kingdom Government to a manufacturer of polyester yarn
(Only the English text is authentic)
(84/509/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments as provided for in the said Article, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By letter dated 30 January 1984, the United Kingdom Government notified the Commission of aid for the establishment of a new production unit for partially oriented polyester yarn (POY) at Stanley, Co. Durham. The relevant decision had been taken in 1982 and the major part of the assistance had already been paid. The yarn manufactured was intended to supply a UK processing company which had difficulty in obtaining supplies of this product on the markets of the Member States.
The assistance to be granted totals £ 1 71 400: £ 420 000 in the form of a selective grant under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972, £ 158 400 in the form of a training grant under Section 7 of the Industrial Development Act 1982 and £ 593 000 in the form of a Regional Development Grant under Part II of the Industrial Development Act 1982. Aid payments of £ 931 400 have already been made towards the investment costs of approximately £ 4 900 000. Before the notification was made, the Commission, acting on a complaint from a trade association, reminded the United Kingdom Government by letter dated 5 December 1983 of its obligations pursuant to the rules on aids to the man-made yarns and fibres industry introduced in 1977 and extended in 1979, 1981 and 1983, which aim to prevent the grant of assistance for the establishment of new capacity in an industry suffering from overcapacity and provide for prior notification of all types of assistance to the industry.
On 29 February 1984 the Commission initiated the procedure under the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of this aid and, by letter dated 8 March 1984, gave formal notice to the United Kingdom Government to submit its comments.
II
Submitting its comments to the Commission under the Article 93 (2) procedure by letter dated 18 April 1984, the United Kingdom Government argued that yarn of the quality produced by the assisted company was not available on the European market in 1981/82 and that UK processors had to import such yarn from third countries like Mexico, Taiwan and the United States. It also stated that the aid had led to the creation of 60 jobs in the recipient company and the maintenance of 75 jobs in downstream activities in north-west Durham, where unemployment is high.
The comments submitted to the Commission under the Article 93 (2) procedure by four Member States other than the United Kingdom and four associations representing the man-made fibres industry expressed support for the Commission's concern. They emphasized the surplus capacity problems in this branch and the efforts made by Community polyester yarn manufacturers in reducing their capacity by 61 500 tonnes: cuts were made both before 1982 and since then and more are still to be made. The comments revealed that the quality of the partially oriented yarn produced by the company at Stanley is not out of the ordinary and could therefore be manufactured by any European firm provided that the demand for the product comes from solvent processors. The UK industrial association pointed to the excess capacity for polyester yarn manufacture dating from 1977.
III
The aid granted by the United Kingdom Government is liable to affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty, by favouring the company in question or its production. Article 92 (1) lays down the principle that aid having the features described therein is incompatible with the common market. The exceptions to this principle set out in Article 92 (3) specify objectives in the Community interest transcending the interests of the aid recipient. These exceptions must be construed narrowly when any regional or industry aid scheme or any individual award under a general aid scheme is scrutinized. In particular, they may be applied only where the Commission is satisfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would not induce the recipient company to adopt a course of action contributing to the attainment of one of the objectives referred to in these exceptions.
To apply the exceptions to aids not furthering any such justifying contribution would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.
In applying these principles in its scrutiny of individual cases, the Commission must satisfy itself that the aid is justified by the contribution the recipient company is making to the attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3), and is necessary to that end. Where this cannot be demonstrated, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to the attainment of the objectives specified in the exceptions but merely serves to bolster the financial position of the company concerned.
In this case the recipient company cannot be said to be making any such contribution in return for the aid.
The United Kingdom Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, grounds for finding that the aid in question satisfies the tests qualifying it for one of the exceptions in Article 92 (3).
With regard to the exceptions provided for by Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aids that promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, the area in which the recipient company is located would qualify it for the exception within the meaning of Article 92 (3) (c). However, the establishment of a new production unit in an insecure branch suffering from overcapacity and the creation of 60 jobs plus the maintenance of 75 further jobs downstream does not seem likely to bring any lasting improvement in the area's underemployment, while it would certainly increase the difficulties of other company in the same industry within the Community. The establishment of the new unit is thus deleterious to the industry. In the regional context, establishing such a unit would be unlikely to secure the jobs in question in the long term, in view of the surplus capacity in the branch concerned.
As far as the exceptions in Article 92 (3) (b) are concerned, the project exhibits no feature of a project of common European interest or of a project to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State whose promotion would justify application of this exception clause. Although the social and economic problems in this part of the United Kingdom give cause for concern, they are not substantially more serious than those of other regions in the Community, while there is a genuine risk of outbidding for aid and any aid to this branch would be particularly likely to affect trade between Member States. Moreover, the socio-economic data available on the United Kingdom provides no grounds for concluding that there is a serious disturbance in its economy within the meaning of the Treaty, and in any case its Government's measures are not aimed at dealing with such a situation.
The aid cannot be regarded as falling within Article 92 (3) (c), that is, as an aid designed to facilitate the development of certain economic activities without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
The Commission has established that Community output of partially oriented polyester, yarn satisfied market requirements in 1981/82 and does so now, a new plant in an industry already in surplus would not contribute to the attainment of an objective in the Community interest that could justify the grant of assistance; indeed, such aid could be detrimental to other Community companies in the industry. The downstream processor's difficulties in obtaining yarn, which prompted the UK authorities to grant aid to a yarn manufacturer to establish facilities, were not caused by the unavailability of the yarn - of which in fact there was a surplus on the markets of the Member States - but by the insolvency of the processing company, which went bankrupt in 1982. It was subsequently taken over by the company forming the subject-matter of this Decision, which took on part of its staff, some 75 persons.
On account of current excess production capacity for all types of polyester yarn Community firms have had to cut back 61 500 tonnes between 1982 and 1985, following a previous reduction of approximately 80 000 tonnes. The production capacity of the industry's firms is used at a rate of between 65 % and 70 %, which means that the plants are not operating profitably. The recipient company itself uses only some 65 % of its capacity. Any new installation of capacity backed by State aid is contrary to the Community interest, which is to reduce capacity, and aggravates the situation of existing firms suffering from overcapacity.
Even in this case where the output of the assisted company is used chiefly within the company itself, which has taken over the operation of a bankrupt processing company, the damage would be no less to firms within the Community, for, faced with the new capacity and rigid consumption patterns, they themselves would have to make additional cuts to offset the new capacity at Stanley.
Since the United Kingdom Government failed to notify the aid in advance, the Commission was unable to state its views on the measures before they were implemented and became aware of them only when roughly £ 931 400 had already been paid to the firm in the form of grants at an approximate rate of 19 % of the investment costs estimated at £ 4 900 000.
Under the Industrial Development Act 1982, further aid in the form of a Regional Development Grant was payable at the rate of 22 % of expenditure by the company on new machinery or plant, buildings or works and wages and salaries. The assistance granted or to be granted constitutes investment aid incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92.
Accordingly, the aid forming the subject-matter of the Article 93 (2) procedure initiated - namely the assistance to the company under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972 (selective grant), Section 7 of the Industrial Development Act 1982 (training grant) and Part II of the Industrial Development Act 1982 (Regional Development Grant) - may not be granted, and the aids already paid to the company so far must be withdrawn,","{'title': '84/509/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 July 1984 concerning assistance by the United Kingdom Government to a manufacturer of polyester yarn (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe assistance notified by the United Kingdom Government by letter dated 30 January 1984 for the establishment of a plant producing partially oriented polyester yarn at Stanley, Co.

","COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 3106/85
of 6 November 1985
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Yugoslavia
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 (6) thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
1. Following a request by a Member State, Italy, into which market substantially all imports of Yugoslav copper sulphate are effected, the Commission, in November 1983, published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) a notice re-opening the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of copper sulphate originating in Yugoslavia.
2. This request alleged, with supporting evidence, that Yugoslav export prices of copper sulphate to the Community, and specifically to Italy, had been, even after the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty of 19.5 % in March 1983, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/83 (3), regularly below the published prices for raw copper which accounts for some 70 % of all production costs of copper sulphate. Accordingly, it was alleged that those export prices did not cover production costs and that this had led to a continuation of dumping, causing further injury to the Community industry.
3. Commission Decision 84/404/EEC (4) confirmed these allegations, a dumping margin of 61 % having been established. It was further calculated on the basis of the facts available to the Commission at the time of the review investigation, that an anti-dumping duty of 53 %, together with a minimum price duty to avoid possible circumvention, would have been required to eliminate the injury sustained by the Community industry and caused by the dumped imports. The level of ad valorem and minimum price duty was established on the basis of the price at which the Community industry would have had to sell to cover all costs of production and allow a 5 % margin for profit.
4. Following discussions in the Cooperation Council set up under the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (5) the Commission, by Decision 84/404/EEC accepted a price undertaking offered by the Yugoslav exporters concerned, and Regulation (EEC) No 486/83 was repealed by Regulation (EEC) No 2333/84 (6).
B. Breach of undertaking
5. On receipt, in 1985, from the Community industry of a complaint that Yugoslav imports of copper sulphate were again entering the Community at prices which were causing material injury, this complaint being supported by published statistical evidence on quantities and prices, the Commission, in accordance with Article 10 (6) of Regulation EEC No 2176/84, requested the Yugoslav exporters to comment. The comments, together with the information received by the Commission on a regular basis from the Yugoslav exporters, gave the Commission reason to believe that the price undertaking had been breached on a significant and regular basis during the period April to June 1985, the peak annual selling period for copper sulphate in the Community, sales being on a seasonal basis.
C. Re-opening
6. In such circumstances, the Commission considers that further investigation is warranted and has therefore re-opened the investigation.
D. Necessity of measures
7. On the basis of the evidence available and given the fact that a further Community producer has ceased operations since the acceptance of the undertaking in 1984, the Commission considers that the exemption from an anti-dumping duty of exporters of copper sulphate originating in Yugoslavia is no longer justified and that it is in the Community's interest to impose forthwith a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Yugoslavia.
E. Rate of duty
8. In accordance with Article 10 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, the rate of duty must be that based on the facts established before the acceptance of the undertaking, i.e. 53 % or the amount by which the free-at-Community-frontier price, offered before duty, to the first importer in the importing Member State is less than 600 ECU, whichever is the higher,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3106/85 of 6 November 1985 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Yugoslavia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 322(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 106a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Court of Auditors (1),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 10(4) to (8) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 (2), the Commission is to calculate and inform Member States of adjustments to the own resources based on value added tax referred to in point (b) of Article 2(1) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom (3) (‘VAT resource’) and on gross national income (GNI) referred to in point (c) of Article 2(1) of that Decision (‘additional resource’) in time for them to enter these adjustments in the Commission's account referred to in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 on the first working day of December.
(2) Under exceptional circumstances, these adjustments may result in very high amounts which may exceed substantially, as regards some Member States, two monthly twelfths to be made available as VAT resources and the additional resource, and in total, for all Member States, half of aggregate monthly twelfths.
(3) For some Member States the obligation to make available such high amounts may represent a high financial burden which may cause a severe fiscal strain on those Member States, particularly towards the end of the year.
(4) Therefore, Member States should have the possibility to request the postponement of the making available of these amounts until the first working day of September of the following year if certain conditions are met.
(5) Without prejudice to the existing obligation to make available the requested amounts to the Commission account, any Member State which decides to apply this option should transmit a request to the Commission, well in advance of the first working day of December, containing the date or dates of making available the adjustments, in order to allow an efficient management of the Union's cash requirements. Any delay in making available those adjustments on the date or dates communicated to the Commission should give rise to interest under the conditions of Article 11 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000.
(6) The amounts to be made available on the first working day of December 2014 as a result of adjustments are of an unprecedented size, a situation that could not have been foreseen when Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 was adopted.
(7) In order to prevent this exceptional and unforeseen situation from creating unreasonably heavy budgetary constraints on Member States just before the year-end, the option provided for in this Regulation should be applicable for adjustments which, pursuant to Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000, had to be entered in the Commission's accounts on the first working day of December 2014. In this regard, the Member States wishing to benefit from that option have already transmitted a formal request with a payment schedule to the Commission before the first working day of December 2014.

Whereas the use of tris (2,3 dibromopropyl)-phosphate to fireproof textile articles was prohibited by Directive 79/663/EEC (4) because of the health hazards it presents ; whereas subsequent examinations have shown that two other fire-retardant products, tris-(aziridinyl)-phosphinoxide and polybrominatedbiphenyls (PBB), are harmful to health and, consequently, should not be employed in textile articles which come into contact with the skin;
Whereas 3,3 dimethoxybenzidine is used in the manufacture of sneezing powder ; whereas, even though the information concerning the mutagenic and carcinogenic properties of this substance is not conclusive, the affinity of the structure of this substance to benzidine, which has a definitely established carcinogenic effect on man, suggests that great caution should be exercized in respect of its potential risks to health ; whereas it is clear that sneezing powder is mainly used by children who, in principle, represent a group which is sensitive to toxic chemicals and who should, consequently, receive special protection against health hazards ; whereas, therefore, the use of this substance should be prohibited in jokes and hoaxes such as sneezing powder;
Whereas some plant-based sneezing powders present dangers to those who use them, especially children, and are already banned for this reason in some Member States;

COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/71 of 21 June 1971 (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee established by Article 3 of that Regulation,
Whereas imports of textile products on the Community market have during recent years given rise to market disturbance and are causing serious damage to Community producers resulting in the closure of factories and considerable loss of employment;
Whereas, in consequence of this situation, imports of certain textile products originating in the majority of low-cost supplier countries are at present subject to a Community system of authorization and quantitative limitation;
Whereas the quantities of products covered by import documents already issued in the first four months of 1984 under the surveillance system introduced in Regulation (EEC) No 2819/79 (2), as last amended and extended by Regulation (EEC) No 3580/83 of 15 December 1983 (3), already reached 120 % of the imports of cotton fabric (category 2) into the Community for the whole of 1983, 91 % of the imports of shirts (category 8) into France for the whole of 1983, 234 % of the imports of towels and towelling (category 9) into the United Kingdom for the whole of 1983 and 90 % of the quantities of products covered by import documents for the whole of 1983 for bed linen (category 20) into the Community;
Whereas the extremely rapid growth in recent months of imports into the Community of cotton fabric, shirts, towels and towelling originating in Turkey has contributed to aggravating the cumulative disruption of these markets and that, particularly, in 1982 and 1983, the Community was obliged to submit the import of cotton fabric and towels to Community or regional restraints;
Whereas this situation, in particular the volume of import documents already issued, makes it necessary to take immediate action in order to avoid irreparable injury to Community producers;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to adopt, pursuant to Article 60 of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey, the protective measures needed to overcome these difficulties; whereas, however, such measures should initially be restricted to suspending temporarily the issuing of new import documents so that the latter's effects on the market situation can be assessed and any measures determined which ought subsequently to be applied,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1259/84 of 4 May 1984 to suspend temporarily the issuing of import documents in respect of certain textile products originating in Turkey', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe issuing of import documents provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2819/79 is suspended for textile products originating in Turkey and the Member States listed in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply until 15 July 1984.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 4 May 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nAntonio GIOLITTI\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 192, 26. 8. 1971, p. 14.\n\n(2) OJ No L 320, 15. 12. 1979, p. 9.\n\n(3) OJ No L 356, 20. 12. 1983, p. 16.\n\nANNEX\n\n1.2.3.4.5.6 //   //   //   //   //   //   // Cate- gory  // CCT heading No  // NIMEXE code (1984)  // Description  // Third countries  // Member States  //   //   //   //   //  //   // 2  // 55.09  //  55.09-03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 29, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, 41, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 98, 99  // Other woven fabrics of cotton: Woven fabrics of cotton, other than gauze, terry fabrics, narrow woven fabrics, pile fabrics, chenille fabrics, tulle and other net fabrics:  // Turkey  // EEC  //   //   //  //   //   //   // 8  // 61.03 A  //  61.03-11, 15, 19  // Men's and boys' under garments, in- cluding collars, shirt fronts and cuffs: Men's and boys' shirts, woven, of wool, of cotton or of man-made textile fibres  // Turkey  // F  //   //  //   //   //   //   // 9  // 55.08 62.02 B III a) 1  // 55.08-10, 30, 50, 80 62.02-71  // Terry-towelling and similar terry fabrics of cotton: Bed linen, table linen, toilet linen and kitchen linen; curtains and other fur- nishing articles: B.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (3). Chloropicrin is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (4) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish lists of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. These lists included chloropicrin.
(3) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (6) the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (7) was adopted on the non-inclusion of chloropicrin.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) The application was submitted to Italy, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) Italy evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 11 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on the risk assessment of chloropicrin to the Commission on 23 February 2011 (8). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 October 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for chloropicrin.
(7) During the evaluation of this active substance, concerns were identified. Those concerns were, in particular, the following. There is an unacceptable risk to operators. It was not possible to perform a reliable groundwater exposure assessment as data were missing concerning the metabolite dichloronitromethane and impurities of the active substance as manufactured. Insufficient data were available to conclude on the risks to sediment dwellers, bees, earthworms and non-target plants. A high risk to aquatic organisms, birds and mammals was identified. It was not possible to perform a reliable surface water and sediment exposure assessment as data were missing for chloropicrin and the metabolite dichloronitromethane. No reliable assessment of exposure concentrations in air of phosgene could be performed. A high potential for long-range atmospheric transport was identified.
(8) The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the conclusion of the Authority. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 21(1) to Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, the Commission invited the applicant to submit comments on the draft review report. The applicant submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.
(9) However, despite the arguments put forward by the applicant, the concerns referred to in recital 7 could not be eliminated. Consequently, it has not been demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing chloropicrin satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) Chloropicrin should therefore not be approved pursuant to Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(11) To provide Member States with time to withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing chloripicrin, Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 should be derogated from.
(12) For plant protection products containing chloropicrin, where Member States grant any period of grace in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 1 year after the withdrawal of the respective authorisation.
(13) This Regulation does not prejudice the submission of a further application for chloropicrin pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(14) In the interest of clarity, the entry for chloropicrin in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC should be deleted.
(15) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

Chloropicrin is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(4)and (EC) No 1490/2002(5)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish lists of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. These lists included chloropicrin.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC(6)the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances(7)was adopted on the non-inclusion of chloropicrin.\n\n((4)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n\n((5)) The application was submitted to Italy, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n\n((6)) Italy evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 11 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on the risk assessment of chloropicrin to the Commission on 23 February 2011(8). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 October 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for chloropicrin.\n\n((7)) During the evaluation of this active substance, concerns were identified. Those concerns were, in particular, the following. There is an unacceptable risk to operators. It was not possible to perform a reliable groundwater exposure assessment as data were missing concerning the metabolite dichloronitromethane and impurities of the active substance as manufactured. Insufficient data were available to conclude on the risks to sediment dwellers, bees, earthworms and non-target plants. A high risk to aquatic organisms, birds and mammals was identified. It was not possible to perform a reliable surface water and sediment exposure assessment as data were missing for chloropicrin and the metabolite dichloronitromethane. No reliable assessment of exposure concentrations in air of phosgene could be performed. A high potential for long-range atmospheric transport was identified.\n\n((8)) The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the conclusion of the Authority. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 21(1) to Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, the Commission invited the applicant to submit comments on the draft review report. The applicant submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.\n\n((9)) However, despite the arguments put forward by the applicant, the concerns referred to in recital 7 could not be eliminated. Consequently, it has not been demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing chloropicrin satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((10)) Chloropicrin should therefore not be approved pursuant to Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n\n((11)) To provide Member States with time to withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing chloripicrin, Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 should be derogated from.\n\n((12)) For plant protection products containing chloropicrin, where Member States grant any period of grace in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 1 year after the withdrawal of the respective authorisation.\n\n((13)) This Regulation does not prejudice the submission of a further application for chloropicrin pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n\n((14)) In the interest of clarity, the entry for chloropicrin in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC should be deleted.\n\n((15)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.\n\n((16)) The Standing Committee on the Food chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion.

On tandem axle bogies, the dampers must be positioned to minimize the oscillaton of the bogies.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe mean damping ratio D must be more than 20 % of critical damping for the suspension in its normal condition with hydraulic dampers in place and operating.\n\n2.4.\n\nThe damping ratio D of the suspension with all hydraulic dampers removed or incapacitated must be not more than 50 % of D.\n\n2.5.\n\nThe frequency of the sprung mass above the driving axle or bogie in a free transient vertical oscillation must not be higher than 2,0 Hz.\n\n2.6.\n\nThe frequency and damping of the suspension are given in paragraph 3. The test procedures for measuring the frequency and damping are laid down in paragraph 4.\n\n3.\n\nDEFINITION OF FREQUENCY AND DAMPING\n\nIn this definition a sprung mass M kg above a driving axle or bogie is considered. The axle or bogie has a total vertical stiffness between the road surface and the sprung mass of K Newtons/metre (N/m) and a total damping coefficient of C Newtons per  metre per second (N.s/m). The vertical displacement of the sprung mass is Z. The equation of motion for free oscillation of the sprung mass is:\n\nM\n\nd²Z\n\ndt²\n\n+ C\n\ndZ\n\ndt\n\n+ kZ = 0.\n\nThe frequency of oscillation of the sprung mass F rad/sec is:\n\nF =\n\nw\n\nK\n\nM\n\n-\n\nC²\n\n4M²\n\nThe damping is critical when C = Co,\n\nwhere\n\nCo = 2\n\nw\n\nKM\n\nThe damping ratio as a fraction of critical is C/Co.\n\nDuring free transient oscillation of the sprung mass the vertical motion of the mass will follow a damped sinusoidal path (Figure 2). The frequency can be estimated by measuring the time for as many cycles of oscillation as can be observed. The damping  can be estimated by measuring the heights of successive peaks of the oscillation in the same direction. If the peak amplitudes of the first and second cycles of the oscillaton are A1 and A2, then the damping ratio D is\n\nD =\n\nC\n\nCo\n\n=\n\n1\n\n2p\n\n.ln\n\nA1\n\nA2\n\nln being the natural logarithm of the amplitude ratio.\n\n4.\n\nTEST PROCEDURE\n\nTo establish by test the damping ratio D, the damping ratio with hydraulic dampers removed, and the frequency F of the suspension, the loaded vehicle should either:\n\n(a) be driven at low speed (5km/hr ± 1 km/hr) over an 80 mm step with the profile shown in Figure 1. The transient oscillation to be analysed for frequency and damping occurs after the wheels on the driving axle have left the step; or\n\n(b) be pulled down by its chassis so that the driving axle load is 1,5 times its maximum static value. The vehicle hold down is suddenly released and the subsequent oscillation analysed; or\n\n(c) be pulled up by its chassis so that the sprung mass is lifted by 80 mm above the driving axle. The vehicle hold up is suddenly dropped and the subsequent oscillation analysed; or\n\n(d) be subjected to other procedures in so far as it has been proved by the manufacturer, to the satisfaction of the technical department, that they are equivalent.\n\nThe vehicle should be instrumented with a vertical displacement transducer between driving axle and chassis, directly above the driving axle. From the trace, the time interval between the first and second compression peaks can be measured to obtain the  frequency F and the amplitude ratio to obtain the damping. For twin drive bogies, vertical displacement transducers should be fitted between each driving axle and the chassis directly above it.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In Article 13 (3) of Council Directive 85/511/EEC provisions are made for emergency vaccination.
(2) The principles provided for in this Article require to balance the decision on resorting to vaccination against basic Community interests which must not be endangered.
(3) Following the reports of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Ireland, the Commission adopted Decisions 2001/172/EC(4), 2001/208/EC(5), 2001/223/EC(6) and 2001/234/EC(7) concerning certain protection measures with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in the respective Member State.

(5) The killing of endangered species susceptible to foot and mouth disease will be an undesirable loss of genetic material and may even result in the eradication of a species therefore such a valuable part of our global heritage should be protected as far as possible.
(6) Zoological gardens or other well defined approved or registered premises with endangered species at risk must implement good husbandry practice, including all necessary precautions to avoid the possible introduction of foot and mouth virus in their premises.
(7) In accordance with Article 13(3) of Directive 85/511/EEC, where the competent authorities of a Member State believe that the disease may compromise endangered species, or other animals such as extremely rare breeds or animals used for irreplaceable and important research work which may also be included on a case by case basis, it is appropriate to provide that the technical modalities for their emergency vaccination shall be specified under a programme that the Member state may present to the Commission as an additional instrument to protect such animals of susceptible species.
(8) Detailed measures for the use of vaccination, identification, and subsequent control of these animals, must be included in the programme to be submitted.
(9) In its report of 10 March 1999 the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare made recommendations on the strategy for emergency vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease, which must be taken into account(9).
(10) Recourse to any kind of vaccination, even though limited to special categories of animals not primarily concerned by trade, may contribute to jeopardise the foot-and-mouth disease status in terms of international trade not only for the Member State or part of its territory where vaccination is carried out.
(11) The Commission prior to taking a Decision on emergency vaccination must ensure that the measures to be taken include at least those provided for in Article 13 (3) first to sixth indent of Directive 85/511/EEC.
(12) It will be necessary to review the present requirements, and the risks for trade in vaccinated zoo animals in the Scientific Committee and with the ""Office International des Epizooties"".

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species (1), and in particular Article 7(1) and Article 9(1)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 89/556/EEC sets out the animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of fresh and frozen embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species.
(2) That Directive provides, inter alia, that bovine embryos are not to be sent from one Member State to another unless they have been conceived by artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation using semen from a donor sire standing at a semen collection centre approved by the competent authority for the collection, processing and storage of semen or semen imported in accordance with Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (2).
(3) Commission Decision 92/452/EEC of 30 July 1992 establishing lists of embryo collection teams and embryo production teams approved in third countries for export of bovine embryos to the Community (3), provides that Member States are to import such embryos from third countries only if they have been collected, processed, including in vitro fertilisation, and stored by embryo collection teams included in the lists in that Decision.
(4) Following trade problems relating to new, stricter requirements for bovine semen used for fertilisation introduced by Commission Decision 92/471/EEC (4), the Commission adopted Decision 2005/217/EC of 9 March 2005 establishing the animal health conditions and the veterinary certification requirements for imports into the Community of bovine embryos (5).
(5) Decision 2005/217/EC allows for a transitional period expiring on 31 December 2006 for imports of bovine embryos collected or produced before 1 January 2006 and conceived using semen not fully complying with Directive 88/407/EEC on condition that such embryos are implanted into female bovine animals present in the Member State of destination and are excluded from intra-Community trade.
(6) The International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) has assessed as negligible the risk of transmission of certain contagious diseases via embryos to recipients or offspring, provided that the embryos are handled properly between their collection and their transfer. That position is also that of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as far as in vivo derived embryos are concerned. Nevertheless, in the interests of animal health, appropriate safeguards should be taken upstream with regard to semen used for fertilisation, in particular with respect to in vitro generated embryos.
(7) Community requirements for imports of bovine embryos derived by natural (in vivo) fertilisation and produced by in vitro fertilisation, in particular as regards semen used for fertilisation, should therefore be adapted.
(8) In the light of the risk assessment carried out by the IETS and in line with the recommendations of the OIE, the conditions governing imports of in vivo derived bovine embryos should be simplified while stricter animal health requirements should be maintained for imports of in vitro produced embryos, with special restrictions where the zona pellucida has been damaged during the process.
(9) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Decision 2005/217/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.
(10) However, in order to enable economic operators to adapt to the new requirements set out in this Decision it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period whereby imports of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species collected or produced before 1 January 2006 may, subject to certain conditions, be imported into the Community according to the requirements set out in Annex V to this Decision.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '28.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 57/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 4 January 2006\nestablishing the animal health and veterinary certification requirements for imports into the Community of bovine embryos and repealing Decision 2005/217/EC\n(notified under document number C(2005) 5796)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/168/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 89/556/EEC sets out the animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of fresh and frozen embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species.\n\n((2)) That Directive provides,inter alia, that bovine embryos are not to be sent from one Member State to another unless they have been conceived by artificial insemination orin vitrofertilisation using semen from a donor sire standing at a semen collection centre approved by the competent authority for the collection, processing and storage of semen or semen imported in accordance with Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(2).\n\n((3)) Commission Decision 92/452/EEC of 30 July 1992 establishing lists of embryo collection teams and embryo production teams approved in third countries for export of bovine embryos to the Community(3), provides that Member States are to import such embryos from third countries only if they have been collected, processed, includingin vitrofertilisation, and stored by embryo collection teams included in the lists in that Decision.\n\n((4)) Following trade problems relating to new, stricter requirements for bovine semen used for fertilisation introduced by Commission Decision 92/471/EEC(4), the Commission adopted Decision 2005/217/EC of 9 March 2005 establishing the animal health conditions and the veterinary certification requirements for imports into the Community of bovine embryos(5).\n\n((5)) Decision 2005/217/EC allows for a transitional period expiring on 31 December 2006 for imports of bovine embryos collected or produced before 1 January 2006 and conceived using semen not fully complying with Directive 88/407/EEC on condition that such embryos are implanted into female bovine animals present in the Member State of destination and are excluded from intra-Community trade.\n\n((6)) The International Embryo Transfer Society (IETS) has assessed as negligible the risk of transmission of certain contagious diseases via embryos to recipients or offspring, provided that the embryos are handled properly between their collection and their transfer.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for authorisation of the additives listed in the Annex to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) The applicant sought for the authorisation of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine. The use of chelated forms may overcome some of the problems of absorption that occurs when other forms are used. A similar product is authorised with amino acids derived from soya protein. However, in this request for authorisation the trace elements are chelated with synthetic glycine and, therefore, needs a specific authorisation.
(6) The applicant submitted a dossier in support of the use in feedingstuffs of chelated forms of iron, manganese, copper and zinc with synthetic glycine.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 12 December 1985
accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the USSR and terminating the investigation
(85/542/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 (2) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the USSR and the People's Republic of China.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the USSR exporter and certain importers of the product concerned requested and were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission and made submissions expressing their views on the duty.
(3) The USSR exporter requested and was granted the opportunity to meet representatives of the complainants for the purpose of presenting his opposing views.
C. Dumping
(4) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty and the Commission therefore considers its findings on dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 to be definitive.
Consequently, the preliminary determinations on dumping are confirmed.
D. Injury
(5) The USSR exporter argued that injury has also been caused by imports originating in other non-member countries not subject to the anti-dumping proceeding and that anti-dumping duties imposed on imports from the USSR and the People's Republic of China only could not be a remedy but would only shift market shares to other low-price exporters.
The Commission had already considered this factor in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 under paragraph 16. As no fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry was received and, in particular, no proof that imports from other non-member countries have been sold at lower prices than those from the USSR and the People's Republic of China or have been dumped was submitted, the Commission therefore confirms the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85.
E. Community interest
(6) One party concerned argued that the introduction of protective measures would not be in the Community's interest because it would make the production of certain bicycles in the Community less competitive.
In view of the negligibly low incidence of a price increase of roller chains for cycles on the cost of bicycle production, the Commission's conclusions on Community interest in Regulation 2317/85 remain, however, unchanged.
F. Undertaking
(7) The USSR exporter, having been informed that the main findings of the preliminary investigation had been confirmed, offered an undertaking concerning its exports of roller chains for cycles to the Community.
The effect of this undertaking will be to increase the export price by an amount equivalent to the anti-dumping duty provisionally imposed and will be sufficient to eliminate the injury caused by the dumped imports.
In these circumstances the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the USSR may be terminated without imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty.
No objection to this course of action was raised in the Advisory Committee.
The Council is to decide under Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 on the collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duty,","{'title': '85/542/EEC: Commission Decision of 12 December 1985 accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the USSR and terminating the investigation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking given by Autoexport, Moscow, USSR, in connection with the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of roller chains for cycles falling within subheading No ex 73.29 of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE Code ex 73.29-11 originating in the USSR is hereby accepted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping investigation referred to in Article 1 is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 12 December 1985.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilly DE CLERCQ\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 217, 14. 8. 1985, p. 7.'}]}"

(3) By its Decision 74/296/Euratom(3) and that of 16 November 1992 the Council conferred on HKG a number of advantages listed in Annex III to the Treaty, for a period of 25 years as from 1 January 1974.
(4) By letters of 25 November 1998, 15 March 1999 and 13 June 2000, HKG requested extension of its tax advantages for the new period for which it had been granted Joint Undertaking status.
(5) HKG's current objective is to implement a programme for decommissioning the nuclear power station up to the safe enclosure stage and, thereafter, to carry out a programme of surveillance of the enclosed nuclear installations.
(6) There is no equivalent to these programmes in the Community since, to date, no high-temperature reactor has been shut down definitively in the Community.
(7) Implementation of these programmes is therefore important since they provide useful experience for the development of the nuclear industry in the Community, notably as regards the decommissioning of nuclear installations.
(8) HKG should be assisted with implementing the programme for decommissioning the nuclear power station up to the safe enclosure stage and the programme of surveillance of the enclosed nuclear installations, by lightening the financial burden.
(9) Arrangements for financing HKG's activities have been agreed between the Federal Government, the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia, HKG and its members for the period up to 31 December 2009.
(10) The advantages conferred on HKG should therefore be extended for the same period as the extension of its Joint Undertaking status, that is until 31 December 2009,","{'title': '2002/356/Euratom: Council Decision of 7 May 2002 on the extension of the advantages conferred on the Joint Undertaking Hochtemperatur-Kernkraftwerk GmbH (HKG)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMember States hereby extend for eleven years with effect from 1 January 1999 the following advantages listed in Annex III to the Treaty conferred on the Joint Undertaking Hochtemperatur-Kernkraftwerk GmbH (HKG):\n\n1. under paragraph 4 of the said Annex, the exemption from the Grunderwerbsteuer (tax on the acquisition of immovable property);\n\n2. under paragraph 5 of the said Annex:\n\n- the exemption from Grundsteuer (land tax),\n\n- the exemption from that part of the profits tax which is levied, pursuant to Article 8, point 1 of the Gewerbesteuergesetz (trade tax law), on the interest due on long-term debt.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe advantages listed in Article 1 shall be conferred on HKG subject to the condition that the Commission has access to all the industrial, technical and economic information, including that relating to safety, acquired by HKG in the course of implementation of the programme for decommissioning the nuclear power station up to the safe enclosure stage and of the programme of surveillance of the enclosed nuclear installations.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1052/2002(4), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community(1), and in particular Article 37 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC concerns the definition of the concept of 'originating products' and methods of administrative cooperation. Article 37(1) thereof provides that derogations from those rules of origin may be adopted where justified by the development of existing industries or the creation of new industries in a country or territory, while Article 37(4) stipulates that, in every case, an examination shall be made to ascertain whether the rules relating to cumulation of origin do not provide a solution to the problem.
(2) On 20 February 2002 the Netherlands requested a derogation from the rule of origin in respect of an annual quantity of 3000 tonnes of non-ACP sugar, imported from Colombia into the Netherlands Antilles, for processing and subsequent exportation to the Community over a period of five years and expected to have a positive impact on the development of the existing industry. The Netherlands requested that this derogation be applied within the annual quantity of 28000 tonnes provided for the ACP/EC-OCT cumulation of origin under Article 6(4) of Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC.
(3) On 13 May 2002, the Netherlands withdrew the request, pending the outcome of an additional examination of the possibilities to supply ACP sugar to the producer concerned.
(4) On 4 October 2002, the Netherlands submitted additional information, according to which sugar producers in five different ACP States had refused, in May and June 2002, to supply the producer with the sugar required, while one sugar producer in Guyana was willing to supply the quantity and quality requested but offered a price (USD 450/tonne fob Georgetown) that was much higher than the price of the Colombian sugar (USD 275/tonne franco warehouse of the purchaser). The Netherlands asked for the request for a derogation from the rule of origin to be reconsidered, in particular on the basis of that information.
(5) In particular the Netherlands indicate that the labour and overheads in the Antilles represents an amount of EUR 1095570 for 3000 tonnes of finished products. The value of the finished products represents EUR 3241200.
(6) An examination of the information supplied shows that the value added of the transaction, as defined by Article 1(i), exceeds 45 % of the ex-works price of the finished product, in both cases of supply of Colombian and Guyana sugar.
(7) According to the information supplied by the Netherlands on the occasion of the request of 20 February 2002, the producer obtained, under the annual quota of 28000 tonnes for 2002, an import licence for a quantity of 6222 tonnes. Consequently, the application by the producer for 2002, pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 192/2002, amounted to a quantity of 10000 tonnes. In accordance with the provisions of Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 192/2000, the producer had to submit its application for 2002 to the national authorities in the first ten working days of February of that year. The producer concerned has submitted its application for an import licence prior to the introduction by the Netherlands of the initial request for a derogation from the rules of origin. When introducing its request for an import license, the producer concerned was not in a position to assume that a derogation from the rules of origin would be granted and therefore took a risk as to whether any or all of the certificates could be used with the possible consequence of the loss of the guarantee.
(8) In the light of all these elements, the requested derogation is not justified with regard to Article 37(1) of Annex III. The information provided indicates that the rules relating to cumulation of origin can provide a solution to the problem. In particular no information has been supplied to the effect that the transaction using Guyana sugar would be so uneconomical as to cause the producer to cease its activities. Moreover, given that the value added represented by the transaction in the case of supply of both Colombian and Guyana sugar exceeds 45 % of the ex-works price of the finished product, Article 37(7) does not apply.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'title': '2003/34/EC: Commission Decision of 10 January 2003 refusing to grant a derogation from Council Decision 2001/822/EC, as regards the rules of origin for sugar from the Netherlands Antilles (notified under document number C(2002) 5501)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe request initially submitted on 20 February 2002 by the Netherlands, and completed on 4 October 2002, for a derogation from Council Decision 2001/822/EC, as regards the rules of origin for sugar from the Netherlands Antilles, is hereby rejected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 January 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrederik Bolkestein\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 314, 30.11.2001, p. 1.'}]}"

Whereas heat generators for space heating and the production of domestic hot water in new or existing non-industrial buildings should be inspected at the stage of manufacture or at the time of installation;
Whereas it should be made compulsory in new non-industrial buildings to provide, in economically justifiable conditions, thermal insulation both for generators and for the system whereby the heated fluids are distributed;
Whereas the Commission should receive regular information on the implementing measures adopted and the results obtained or anticipated;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 144(1), in conjunction with Article 4, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Stabilisation and Association Agreement’), signed on 16 June 2008, is in the process of ratification.
(2) The Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Interim Agreement’), and the measures adopted by Council Regulation (EC) No 594/2008 of 16 June 2008, on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (2), provide for the early implementation of the trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
(3) The Interim Agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement provide that wines originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina may be imported into the Union, within the limits of Union tariff quotas, and subject to the condition that no export subsidies should be paid for exports of these quantities by Bosnia and Herzegovina, at a zero-rate customs duty.
(4) The Commission should adopt the implementing measures for the opening and the administration of those Union tariff quotas.
(5) In Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3), management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of acceptance of customs declarations are set out.
(6) Particular care should be taken to ensure that all Union importers have equal and continuous access to the tariff quotas and that the zero-rate duty laid down for the quotas is applied uninterruptedly to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted. In order to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of those quotas, there should be no obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. Communication between the Member States and the Commission should, as far as possible, take place by electronic transmission.
(7) From the entry into force of the Interim Agreement on 1 July 2008 until the final day of application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 of 30 November 2009 introducing exceptional measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union’s Stabilisation and Association process (4), wine exports from Bosnia and Herzegovina took place within quota number 09.1515 set out in that Regulation. This Regulation should therefore apply from 1 January 2011.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1600/83 (2), and in particular Article 26 (4) thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/83 (3) laid down general rules for the supply of milk and certain milk products to schoolchildren;
Whereas there is a need for detailed rules, taking account, where possible, of schemes already implemented in some Member States and the experience thus gained; whereas it is necessary inter alia to define the beneficiaries of the scheme in question and the characteristics of the products;
Whereas, in order to take account of problems involving conservation and transport, it would be appropriate, in the case of schools in the French overseas departments, to provide that chocolate-flavoured or flavoured milk for which a subsidy is granted may be reconstituted milk;
Whereas it would be appropriate also to specify the cases in which, under Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1842/83, the quantity of milk distributed daily may exceed 0,25 litre;
Whereas, it is necessary to determine for each product the amount corresponding to 125 % of the target price;
Whereas Member States must ensure that the products in question are not used for a purpose other than that for which they are intended;
Whereas it is essential to specify that the aid is granted in respect of the use of Community products; whereas, moreover, provision should be made, for control purposes, for the products to be purchased in the Member State in which the school is located from approved suppliers in that Member State; whereas, for the same reasons and in view of the purposes of the measure, the commitments to be entered into by suppliers and schools should be determined;
Whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1598/77 of 15 July 1977 laying down detailed rules for the sale of milk and certain milk products at reduced prices to schoolchildren (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1440/83 (5), no longer apply; whereas, for reasons of clarity, that Regulation should be expressly repealed;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/83 is applicable from 1 August 1983; whereas application of the new detailed rules introduced by this Regulation may cause implementing difficulties in some Member States; whereas Member States should therefore be authorized to derogate from it during the 1983/84 school year;
Whereas the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2167/83 of 28 July 1983 laying down detailed rules for the supply of milk and certain milk products to schoolchildren', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe beneficiaries of the Community aid referred to in Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1842/83 shall be schoolchildren and students regularly attending a school of any grade or category including nursery schools but excluding universities and institutes of further education comparable with universities.\n\nThe schoolchildren referred to above shall qualify for Community aid during periods spent at holiday camps organized by a school, an association, a group or a local authority as referred to in Article 7 (1).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 9,004 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4177/2 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 8 August 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Marche; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;

Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the authorities of Italy has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/6 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of Italy;

of 22 May 1985
concerning an aid scheme for potable spirits producers in France

(85/379/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 798/85 (2),
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty,
Whereas:
I
On 3 October 1983, the French Government notified the Commission under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty of a scheme to assist producers of potable spirits, to be implemented subject to the Commission's approval.
By telex dated 6 October 1983, followed by a telexed reminder on 17 November 1983, the Commission asked the French Government to supply further information about the scheme.
In a letter dated 7 December 1983, the French Government sent the Commission a brief reply.
On 31 January 1984, the Commission again contacted the French Government requesting further details.
By letter dated 13 March 1984 and by telex dated 30 March 1984, the French Government asked the Commission to give it more time to reply.
By telex dated 11 April 1984, the French Government sent the Commission additional information, pointing out, however, that the details of certain aids still had to be worked out.
The scheme provides for FF 12 million in grants to armagnac and calvados producers for storage and maturing operations. The anticipated duration of the scheme is three years.
The French Government gives as the main reason for awarding such aid the fact that the spirits producers in question are faced with structural and economic difficulties.
II
Armagnac and calvados are products which compete with spirits and alcoholic beverages produced in other Member States, notably whisky, brandies and gin. In 1982, intra-Community trade in all these products was worth approximately 800 million ECU.
In recent years, a fall in the consumption of these products has been recorded in most Member States.
This is due, on the one hand, to the general economic recession and, on the other, to the increase in the taxes and excise duties levied on such products.
In France, sales of alcoholic beverages other than wine and beer fell by 4 % in 1983 compared with 1980. Over the same period, sales of cognac fell by 26,5 %, of armagnac by 17 % and of calvados by 32 %. On the other hand, sales of grain spirits (whisky, gin, etc.) increased by 41 %. The considerable drop in cognac, armagnac and calvados sales is due especially to an increase in the taxes on those products.
Armagnac production is dependent on production of the region's wines and sometimes varies considerably from year to year.
Exports to Community countries account for approximately 50 % of sales on the French market.
As with armagnac, calvados production varies greatly from one year to the next depending on the apple harvest in Normandy.
In 1982, exports to Community countries accounted for approximately 30 % of sales on the French market and 84 % of total calvados exports.
III
Following scrutiny of the planned aid under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, effected on the basis of the analysis of the market in the products concerned on the one hand, and having regard to the additional information furnished by the French authorities on
the other, the Commission decided on 30 May 1984 to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) EEC in respect of the aids for the private storage and maturing of armagnac and calvados on account of their effects on trade between Member States. The expected cost of financing these measures is FF 12 million.
Under the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission gave the French Government and the other Member States and interested parties other than the Member States notice to submit their comments.
The French Government replied on 1 August 1984 to the Commission's letter of formal notice of 8 June 1984, arguing, among other things, that in respect of the aids for the private storage of armagnac and calvados those products are produced using traditional methods in rural areas giving rise to a high manufacturing cost for the producers concerned.
Of the other Member States, the United Kingdom Government supports the Commission's action in initiating the Article 93 (2) EEC procedure; it points out in particular that United Kingdom spirits producers face serious difficulties in exporting their products and that the French aids cause distortions of competition in the spirits and comparable products sector.
Of the interested parties other than the Member States, the Scotch Whisky Association expressed similar concern in its letter to the Commission dated 28 February 1984.
IV
By notifying in good time its proposal to provide assistance to spirits producers, the French Government has fulfilled its obligation under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
In the sector of alcoholic beverages, and more particularly of spirits, there are substantial trade flows between Member States and competition is intense, partly because there is surplus production capacity and partly because consumption of such products is either at a standstill or is declining. When State aids strengthen the competitive position of certain firms whose products for the subject-matter of intra-Community trade, the latter must be deemed to be affected by those aids. In the present case, by reducing certain costs or increasing the income of the recipient firms, the planned aids may affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty, which provides that such aids are incompatible with the common market.
The exceptions to this principle do not apply in this case in view of the features of the plannned aids and the fact that they do not seek to satisfy the conditions for application of those exceptions.
Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty specifies which aids may be considered compatible with the common market. Such compatibility is determined in the light of objectives pursued in the interest of the Community and not in that of a single Member State.
In order to safeguard the proper functioning of the common market, and having regard to the principle embodied in Article 3 (f) of the EEC Treaty, the exceptions to the incompatibility of aids provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty must be construed narrowly when any aid is scrutinized.
In particular, they may be invoked only where the Commission is satifsfied that, without the aid, market forces alone would be insufficient to guide the recipients towards patterns of behaviour that would serve one of the said objectives.
To apply the said exceptions in the case of aid that did not serve such an objective or where aid is not necessary for that purpose would be to place the industries or firms of certain Member States at an unfair advantage. Their financial position would be bolstered as a result, whereas trading conditions between Member States would be affected and competition distorted without any jusification on grounds of the common interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3).
The proposed assistance for the storage and maturing of armagnac and calvados spirits would relieve the recipients of certain costs inherent in those operations. In fact, the operations are intended to enable them to sell later a better quality product at a higher price. This means that the producer foregoes an immediate income and pays certains costs, which are covered, however, by a higher return at some point in the future. Both in France and in other Member States, however, spirits competing with armagnac and calvados undergo similar treatment without their producers qualifying for assistance to cover part of the cost.
To agree to such aid being granted to armagnac and calvados producers alone would, under the circumstances, be tantamount to inflicting on their competitors a disadvantage which might be reflected in an unwarranted drop in their sales.
The aid is operating aid involving no restructuring, redeployment or innovation. V
In view of the above, the prohibition provided for in Article 92 (1) cannot be waived under paragraph 2 of that Article, given that the exceptions provided for in that paragraph are clearly not applicable in the present case.
Nor do the aids for the private storage and maturing of armagnac and calvados satisfy the conditions for the application of one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
With regard to the exceptions contained in subparagraphs (a) and (c) of Article 92 (3) for aids to promote the development of certain areas, the Armagnac and Calvados areas are not ones where the standard of living is abnormally low or where there is serious underemployment within the meaning of subparagraph (a).
The operating aids planned by the French Government are not likely to contribute to the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of subparagraph (c).
As regards the exceptions provided for in subparagraph (b) of Article 92 (3), it is obvious that the aids in question are not intended to support a project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the French economy.
Lastly, as to the exception in subparagraph (c) of Article 92 (3) regarding aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, the aids in question, being intended to cover certain operating costs, cannot have a development effect within the meaning of that exception. Moreover, the fact that a substantial proportion of the products which are to qualify for assistance is exported to other Member States makes it impossible to take the view that trading conditions would not be affected to an extent contrary to the common interest.
Consequently, the planned aids do not satisfy the conditions necessary for application of one of the exceptions in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': ""82/379/EEC: Commission Decision of 19 May 1982 establishing that the apparatus described as 'Beckman - UV Spectrophotometer, model 24 with recorder and accessories' may not be imported free of Common Customs Tariff duties (Only the French, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, English and Greek texts are authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty specifies which aids may be considered compatible with the common market.

After consultation of the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions, the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of the Regulation, the Commission shall take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The United Kingdom Government submitted to the Commission on 14 April 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the West Midlands region fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The draft contains the information listed in Article 16 of the Regulation, and in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000, the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible shall be 1 January 2000. Under Article 30 of the Regulation, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the single programming document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(8) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.

The annual breakdown must be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 20 December 1996, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 (1). Since Community demand for the products in question is to be met under the most favourable conditions, certain existing tariff quotas should be extended or adjusted, and some new Community tariff quotas should be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, without disturbing the markets for these products.
(2) Since the quota amount for one Community tariff quota is insufficient to meet the needs of the Community industry for the current quota period, it should be increased with effect from 1 January 2007.
(3) It is no longer in the Community interest to continue to grant Community tariff quotas in 2007 for certain products on which duties were suspended in 2006. These products should therefore be removed from the table in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96.
(4) In view of the many changes to be made, clarity requires Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 to be replaced in its entirety.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) In view of the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely upon the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes naled.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, naled (CAS Nr 300-76-5; EC Nr 206-098-3) has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) France was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 17 February 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 9 December 2011, in an assessment report.
(5) The assessment has demonstrated that biocidal products used as insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods and containing naled cannot be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. The scenarios evaluated in the human health risk assessment as well as in the environmental risk assessment showed a potential and unacceptable risk. Furthermore, the evaluation has not demonstrated sufficient efficacy. It is therefore not appropriate to include naled for use in product type 18 in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) In the interest of legal certainty, the date as of which biocidal products of product type 18 containing naled should no longer be placed on the market should be specified, taking into account both the unacceptable effects of those products and the legitimate expectations of manufacturers of those products.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '15.5.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 126/12', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 11 May 2012\nconcerning the non-inclusion of naled for product type 18 in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market\n(notified under document C(2012) 3050)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/257/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products,
Whereas:
(1) Following the publication of a scientific study in 2001, entitled ‘Use of permanent hair dyes and bladder cancer risk’, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers, replaced by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP), by Commission Decision 2004/210/EC (2), concluded that the potential risks were of concern. It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye substances.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products further recommended an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dye substances including the requirements for testing substances used in hair dye products for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.
(3) Following the opinions of the SCCP, the Commission, together with Member States and stakeholders, agreed on an overall strategy to regulate substances used in hair dye products, according to which the industry was required to submit files containing the scientific data on hair dye substances to be evaluated by the SCCP.
(4) Substances for which no updated safety files are submitted allowing an adequate risk assessment should be included in Annex II to Directive 76/768/EEC.
(5) Some hair dye substances have already been banned, either as a result of opinions by the SCCP or due to lack of safety data. The substances currently under consideration were carefully selected to be regulated together since they are listed in Annex IV. As no safety files on these substances for their use in hair dye products were submitted to the SCCP for a risk assessment by the agreed deadlines, there is no evidence that these substances, when used in hair dye products, can be considered safe for human health.
(6) Substances without safety files 1-Hydroxy-2,4-diaminobenzene (2,4-Diaminophenol) and its dihydrochloride salt; 1,4-Dihydroxybenzene (Hydroquinone); [4-[[4-anilino-1-naphthyl][4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]methylene]cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]dimethylammoniumchloride (Basic Blue 26); Disodium 3-[(2,4-dimethyl-5-sulphonatophenyl)azo]-4-hydroxynaphthalene-1-sulpho-nate (Ponceau SX) and 4-[(4-Aminophenyl)(4-iminocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene)methyl]-o-toluidine and its hydrochloride salt (Basic Violet 14), currently listed as colorants in Annex IV and as hair dye substances in Annex III, Part 1 and Part 2, shall be deleted from Annex III and banned for use in hair dye products in Annex II.
(7) Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of the Council of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1806/89 (2), and in particular Article 5 (5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1424/76 of 21 June 1976 laying down general rules for intervention on the market in rice (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 794/91 (4) and in particular the second paragraph of Article 4 thereof,
Whereas where rice is purchased from intervention agencies for the purposes of fulfilling obligations arising from the award of food-aid supply contracts in connection with international conventions on food aid or other supplementary programmes, the conditions applicable with regard to prices and the detailed rules of application are to be determined in advance;
Whereas, in order to enable interested parties to take part under optimum conditions in the procedure for the award of food-aid supply contracts, they should be given the possibility of examining at their expense the quality and the characteristics of the product before the expiry of the closing date for the submission of tenders;
Whereas, in order to facilitate transactions, purchase applications must contain all information required to identify the product;
Whereas, in order to avoid disruption of the Community market and any distortion of competition between Community operators, the purchase price for the goods from public storage must be determined according to clear-cut criteria and be known to all tenderers in advance; whereas, in view of these requirements, provision should be made for goods purchased by the person awarded a food-aid supply contract to be paid for at the buying-in price determined pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76;
Whereas, in order that the conditions of competition existing when tenders are submitted for the award of the food-aid supply contract are not altered subsequent to the award of the contract, a derogation from the application of certain procedures for adjusting the prices on the basis of the date of conclusion of the purchase contract or the date of removal of the goods should be introduced;
Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87 of 8 July 1987 laying down general rules for the mobilization in the Community of products to be supplied as Community food aid (5) makes provision for the successful tenderer to deliver, with a view to a food-aid supply contract, rather than goods from public stocks or, where appropriate, manufactured therefrom, goods mobilized on the market or manufactured therefrom provided that he purchases the goods mentioned in the notice of invitation to tender; whereas compliance with this latter obligation is essential on the one hand to meet the objective of contributing towards reducing public stocks and on the other hand to ensure the equality of operators in the award of the supply contract; whereas provision should therefore be made for the lodging by the successful tenderer of a specific security to ensure compliance with the obligation to pay the purchase price to the intervention agency concerned within a short time; whereas, consequently, with a view to that objective, provision should be made for failure to lodge a purchase application with the intervention agency under the conditions laid down to result in the loss of the security relating to the supply of the food aid, lodged pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (6), as mended by Regulation (EEC) No 3745/89 (7), should be applied for the lodging and the release of that specific security;
Whereas the execution of Community food-aid supply contracts is the subject of specific surveillance arrangements; whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 569/88 of 16 February 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2322/91 (9), should accordingly not apply;

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For Adoxophyes orana granulovirus the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2007/669/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Germany received on 29 November 2004 an application from Andermatt Biocontrol GmbH for the inclusion of the active substance Adoxophyes orana granulovirus in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2007/669/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 13 August 2008.
(4) The draft assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance Adoxophyes orana granulovirus
 (4) on 4 April 2012. The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and was finalised on 13 July 2012 in the format of the Commission review report for Adoxophyes orana granulovirus.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing Adoxophyes orana granulovirus may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve Adoxophyes orana granulovirus.
(6) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing Adoxophyes orana granulovirus. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(7) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.

ForAdoxophyes orana granulovirusthe conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2007/669/EC(3).\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Germany received on 29 November 2004 an application from Andermatt Biocontrol GmbH for the inclusion of the active substanceAdoxophyes orana granulovirusin Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2007/669/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((3)) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 13 August 2008.\n\n((4)) The draft assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substanceAdoxophyes orana granulovirus(4)on 4 April 2012. The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and was finalised on 13 July 2012 in the format of the Commission review report forAdoxophyes orana granulovirus.\n\n((5)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containingAdoxophyes orana granulovirusmay be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approveAdoxophyes orana granulovirus.\n\n((6)) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containingAdoxophyes orana granulovirus. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((7)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1208/84 (2), and in particular Article 51 (1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 50 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 lays down that the products referred to in Article 1 (2) (a) and (b) of that Regulation may be imported only if they are accompanied by a certificate attesting that they comply with the provisions governing production, marketing and, should such be the case, supply for direct human consumption in the third countries in which they originate;
Whereas Article 51 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 lays down that products imported from third countries and falling within heading No 22.05 of the Common Customs Tariff which have undergone oenological practices not allowed by Community rules, or which do not conform either to the provisions of that Regulation or to those adopted in implementation thereof, may not, except by way of derogation, be offered or disposed of for direct human consumption;
Whereas Article 2 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 354/79 of 5 February 1979 laying down general rules for the import of wines, grape juice and grape must (3), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession, exempts from the requirement to present the abovementioned certificate imports of wine originating in and coming from third countries whose annual exports to the Community are less than 1 000 hl; whereas, in view of the current level of exports of United States wines to the Community, an arrangement should be introduced which is more appropriate to the situation;
Whereas, with the aim of fostering the harmonious development of trade in wine products between the Community and the United States of America, and in view of the effectiveness of the control system in force in the United States and the particular extent to which compliance with provisions governing the production, marketing and disposal of wine for direct human consumption is thereby ensured, the import into the Community of United States wines which have undergone certain oenological processes not provided for by Community rules should be authorized if, in the present state of scientific knowledge, those processes have been shown to be identical or almost equivalent to oenological processes permitted in the Community; whereas other oenological processes in use in the United States which are not permitted in the Community necessitate further scientific research; whereas, therefore, authorization for the import into the Community of United States wines which have undergone such processes should be limited to a certain period; whereas, however, it should be made clear that such authorization may be reviewed at any time, after consultation with the United States authorities, in particular were it to be found that the use of certain oenological practices could present a public health risk;
Whereas, in a letter sent to the Government of the United States of America on 6 July 1983, the Community, represented by the Commission, expressed the intention of modifying Community provisions in respect of oenological processes with a view to encouraging trade in the wine sector; whereas the necessary provisions should therefore be incorporated in Community legislation in order to put those modifications into effect;
Whereas the Government of the United States of America undertook in its letter dated 26 July 1983 to delete from the American provisions a large number of substances whose use has hitherto been permitted in the manufacture of wine, and to replace expressions having little meaning in such provisions with scientific terms, thus making identification easier; whereas the Government of the United States of America further undertook to ensure that geographical names referring to a Community wine-growing area were no longer used as generic names unless such use was traditional; whereas the Government of the United States of America also undertook to work in constant collaboration with the Community with the object of expanding scientific knowledge on certain oenological processes referred to in 1 (b) of the Annex to this Regulation; whereas, moreover, the United States Government recognized the need to establish collaboration between on the one hand, the competent autho
rities in the Member States, coordinated if necessary by the Commission, and on the other hand, the competent American authorities in order to facilitate the prevention of fraud; whereas these commitments should, therefore, be respected and provision should be made for certain derogatioins from Article 51 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1873/84 of 28 June 1984 authorizing the offer or disposal for direct human consumption of certain imported wines which may have undergone oenological processes not provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 337/79', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 1 of 28 April 1970 laying down additional provisions for the common organization of the market in wine, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2722/71, 2 and in particular Article 9 (6) thereof;
Whereas the first subparagraph of Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 provides that where the free-at-frontier offer price for a wine, plus customs duties, is lower than the reference price for that wine, a countervailing charge equal to the difference between the reference price and the free-at-frontier offer price plus customs is to be levied on imports of that wine and of wines in the same category;
Whereas, however, that countervailing charge is not levied as regards third countries which are prepared and in a position to guarantee that the price of imports of products originating in and coming from their territory will not be lower than the reference price less customs duties and that any deflection of trade will be avoided:
Whereas the following have intimated their readiness to give that guarantee in respect of exports of certain wines to the Community:    - the Government of the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria by application dated 13 December 1971;
- the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco by application dated 20 December 1971;
- the Government of the Tunisian Republic by application dated 5 January 1972;
- the Government of the Republic of Turkey by application dated 10 January 1972;
Whereas exports of Algerian wine to the Community will be effected only on the basis of a written contract concluded with the Office National de Commercialisation et d'Exportation des Produits viti-vinicoles, an official agency under the control of the Ministry of Agriculture and the sole exporter ; whereas exports of wines to the Community will be effected only if the free-at-Community-frontier offer price is not lower than the reference price less customs duties actually levied;
Whereas exports of Moroccan wine to the Community will be effected only on the basis of a written contract concluded with the Office de Commercialisation et d'Exportation, an official agency under the control of the Ministry of Trade and the sole exporter ; whereas exports of wine to the Community will be effected only if the free-at-Community-frontier offer price is not lower than the reference price less customs duties actually levied;
Whereas the Tunisian Government has given an undertaking that all exports of wine to the Community will be effected only on the basis of a written contract under the supervision of the Office du Vin de Tunisie, a Government agency which will issue a registration certificate authorizing export only if the free-at-Community-frontier offer price is not lower than the reference price less customs duties actually levied;
Whereas the Turkish Government has given an undertaking that all exports of wine to the Community will be effected only on the basis of a  1OJ No L 99, 5.5.1970, p. 1. 2OJ No L 282, 23.12.1971, p. 1.
written contract after approval by the Ministry of Trade which will issue the registration certificate authorizing export only if the free-at-Community-frontier offer price is not lower than the reference price less customs duties actually levied;
Whereas the Tunisian and Turkish Governments have, moreover, undertaken to impose appropriate penalties on their exporters in order to ensure compliance with the measures taken;
Whereas furthermore the Algerian, Moroccan, Tunisian and Turkish Governments will ensure that any deflection of trade will be avoided ; whereas they will take any measures necessary for this purpose and take all appropriate steps to ensure, in particular, that no action is taken which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the reference prices less customs duties actually levied, such as taking over marketing costs, resorting to linked transactions, or any other action having similar effect;
Whereas they undertake to communicate regularly to the Commission details of wine exports to the Community and to enable the Commission to exercise a continuous supervision of the effectiveness of the measures they have taken;
Whereas questions affecting observance of the guarantees given have been discussed in detail with the competent authorities of each of these third countries ; whereas, following these discussions, it may be assumed that they are in a position to abide by their guarantees ; whereas consequently there is no need to levy a countervailing charge on imports of certain wines originating in and coming from Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia or Turkey ; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2223/70 1 waiving the countervailing duty on imports of certain wines originating in and coming from certain third countries, as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2436/71, 2 should be supplemented accordingly;
Whereas pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2313/71 3 of 29 October 1971, as regards Algeria, and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2823/71 4 of 20 December 1971, as regards Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey, compliance with conditions listed in the second subparagraph of Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 816/70 also leads to the provisional partial suspension, until 31 August 1972, of the Common Customs Tariff duties applicable to wines originating in and coming from these countries and which are the subject of the quarantees ; whereas this suspension therefore will become operative on the date on which this Regulation takes effect;

Whereas the marketing years for a certain number of agricultural products begin on 1 July; whereas, in addition, the 1986/87 milk year has been caried forward until 30 June; whereas the Council has not, to date, adopted the prices for the 1987/88 marketing years for a large number of agricultural products; whereas the Commission, in compliance with the tasks entrusted to it by the Treaty, is obliged to adopt the precautionary measures essential to ensure continuity of operation of the common agricultural policy; whereas, pending the decisions to be taken imminently by the Council or, failing this, by the Commission for the new 1987/88 marketing years, these measures are taken as a precaution and are without prejudice to the said decisions;
Whereas these short-term precautionary measures should be aimed at retaining on a provisional basis, from 1 July 1987 and at the level of 30 June 1987;
- the import levies for milk and milk products,
- the accession compensatory amounts,
- the aids for colza and rape seeds, dried fodder, peas, field beans and sweet lupins,
- the production refunds for sugar;
Whereas, however, as regards cereals and sugar, the import levies should be determined as from 1 July on the basis of the threshold prices valid on 30 June;
Whereas provisions should also be made to retain as from 1 July the intervention buying-in prices for skimmed-milk powder, sugar and colza and rape seeds and to retain the minimum prices for peas, field beans and sweet lupins;
Whereas the co-responsibility levies for milk and milk products and for cereals are one of the key factors in ensuring balance on the markets concerned; whereas they should be retained at the levels applicable on 30 June;
Whereas the Commission has already been obliged, pending a decision by the Council, to lay down as a precautionary measure, by Regulations (EEC) No 1213/87 (1) and (EEC) No 1503/87 (2), a number of prices in the fruit and vegetable sector in order to ensure the continuity of the intervention arrangements for those products in respect of which the period of application of the basic and buying-in prices began in May and June; whereas the prices applicable from 1 July for the products in question should be fixed along the same lines;
Whereas, pending the fixing of the prices for the 1987/88 marketing year, the measures necessary to avoid speculative trading and market disturbance should be adopted; whereas this aim can be met by suspending the possibility of advance fixing of the import levies, export refunds and certain of the aids referred to above;
Whereas it should be stressed that the amounts set out in this Regulation will be adjusted, where appropriate, with effect from 1 July, on the basis of the decisions adopted in respect of the prices for the 1987/88 marketing year; whereas, likewise, the attention of traders should be drawn to the fact that the monetary compensatory amounts applicable will be adjusted, where appropriate, with effect form 1 July, on the basis of the decisions adopted in respect of prices and the representative rates,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1826/87 of 29 June 1987 on precautionary measures and the suspension of advance fixing in certain sectors', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) In September 1993 the Commission received a complaint from the Committee of the Cotton and Allied Textile Industries of the EC ('Eurocoton`) concerning imports of certain types of bedlinen originating in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. The complaint was lodged on behalf of producers of the product in question allegedly representing a major proportion of total bedlinen output in the Community. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain types of bedlinen of certain fibres, pure or mixed, bleached, dyed or printed, falling within CN codes 6302 21 00, 6302 22 90, 6302 31 10, 6302 31 90 and 6302 32 90.
(2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) Owing to the volume of information gathered and the complexity of the investigation, the proceeding exceeded the normal duration of one year as provided for in Article 7 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
II. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(4) The complainant Community producers formally withdrew the complaint concerning imports of certain types of bedlinen originating in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey. The Commission considers that a termination in this context would not be contrary to the interest of the Community.
(5) Consequently, the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain types of bedlinen originating in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey should be terminated without imposition of protective measures.
(6) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.
(7) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding and have been given the opportunity to comment,","{'title': '96/416/EC: Commission Decision of 9 July 1996 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain types of bedlinen originating in India, Pakistan, Thailand and Turkey'}"

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (2) provides for a system of derived intervention prices the level of which must be fixed in such a way that the differences between them reflect the disparities which, given a normal harvest, arise under natural conditions of price formation on the market, and that the forces of supply and demand may adapt freely on that market;
Whereas there is a surplus on the market in rice in Italy and a deficit in the other Member States ; whereas experience has shown that in such a situation freedom of movement within the Community is not influenced by a system of derived intervention prices but by the ratio between the target price and the intervention price ; whereas the system of regional prices should be abolished and replaced by a single intervention price;
Whereas there should be sufficient difference between the target price, which determines the level of protection of the Community market, and the intervention price to ensure market fluidity and to balance surpluses in production areas with requirements in consumer areas ; whereas, to attain this objective, the target price should be established on the basis of the intervention price, taking into consideration, in addition to the element reflecting the cost of transport between the area having the largest surplus and that having the largest deficit, and also husking costs, a market element reflecting the difference, in the production area with the largest surplus, between market prices and the level of the intervention price following a normal harvest;

Pursuant to Decision 2012/734/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion.
(2) Annex II to the Agreement concerns the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation. For a number of products, Appendix 2A to that Annex provides for the possibility of derogations from the rules of origin set out in Appendix 2 to Annex II in the framework of annual quotas. As the Union has decided to use that possibility, it is necessary to provide the conditions for the application of those derogations for imports from Central America.
(3) The quotas set out in Appendix 2A to Annex II should be managed on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (2).

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 958/93 of 5 April 1993 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative import restrictions and monitoring of textile and clothing products originating in certain third countries
THE COUNCIL OF  THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Community has negotiated agreements with a number of supplier countries on trade in textile products on the basis of the Protocol for the extension of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement; whereas a number of other protocols, arrangements or specific  import regimes are also applied with some third countries in the context of association agreements and other types of preferential arrangements;
Whereas these agreements, protocols and arrangements provide, inter alia, that the supplier countries' exports into the Community of certain textile products falling within Section XI of the combined nomenclature shall be subject to quantitative limits  fixed at Community level or to a monitoring procedure;
Whereas a basic characteristic of these agreements, protocols and arrangements is the establishment of a double-checking system in order to ensure compliance with the quantitative limits established thereunder;
Whereas Article 8a of the Treaty provides for the creation of an internal market, comprising an area without internal frontiers in which the free circulation of goods is ensured; whereas for this reason and also to take account of the principles laid  down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities the above agreements, protocols and arrangements do not provide any more for the breakdown of the Community quantitative limits into national sub-quotas;
Whereas in order to apply Community quantitative limits and monitoring procedures in conformity with the agreements, protocols and arrangements negotiated with the supplier countries it is necessary to establish a special management procedure;
Whereas it is desirable that such a common management system be decentralized as far as possible by allowing import authorizations to be issued, as in the past, by the Member States' authorities in accordance with the double-checking system established  in those agreements, protocols and arrangements;
Whereas, however, it is necessary, in the absence of the breakdown of the Community quantitative limits into national sub-quotas, to make sure that the competent authorities of the Member States, when issuing the import licences, do not exceed the  quantitative limits establishing in the agreements, protocols or arrangements;
Whereas for this purpose the competent authorities of the Member States should not issue import licences before obtaining the prior confirmation of the Commission that there are still amounts available of the total Community quantitative limit for which  an application is submitted by an importer to the said competent authorities;
Whereas the Commission should provide its confirmation to the requests notified by Member States, and shall allocate to the extent possible, the full amount notified;
Whereas requests notified by the competent authorities to the Commission shall be considered to be valid if they establish the supplier third country, the category of textile products concerned, the amount to be imported, the number of the export  licence and the Member State of intended customs clearance;
Whereas pending the establishing and smooth operation of the central computerized system it is necessary to provide, for a limited period of time, that Member States shall not issue import licences over a certain initial maximum amount of the total  Community import limit; whereas this maximum amount should be fixed in terms of certain percentages of the Community quota uniform for each product category and for each third country concerned;
Whereas for the effective management of the Community quantitative limits and to establish the total amount of imports subject to a monitoring procedure during this transitional period, the competent authorities of the Member States should submit at  regular intervals statistical information of the licences issued;
Whereas it should be possible during this transitional period to allow for certain adjustments to be made to the maximum amounts provided for each Member State, so as to take account of the number of import applications submitted in the Member States as  well as the level of utilization of each quantitative limit concerned;
Whereas it is necessary to provide that a committee will assist the Commission for the purposes of implementation of this Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 958/93 of 5 April 1993 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative import restrictions and monitoring of textile and clothing products originating in certain third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

amending Annexes I and II to Council Directive 2002/56/EC as regards minimum conditions to be satisfied by seed potatoes and lots of seed potatoes
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/56/EC of 13 June 2002 on the marketing of seed potatoes (1), and in particular Article 24 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Since the adoption of Directive 2002/56/EC new methods of potato breeding have been developed, diagnostic tools to identify harmful organisms and agronomic practices to fight the spread of harmful organisms have been improved.
(2) Those technical developments permit the production of seed potatoes fulfilling stricter requirements than those laid down in Annexes I and II to Directive 2002/56/EC. At the same time knowledge about new disease agents has become available and knowledge about existing diseases has evolved showing that some diseases require stricter measures.
(3) Against this background, the standard of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the marketing and commercial quality control of seed potatoes has been adapted in view of those technical and scientific developments (2).
(4) Taking into account those developments, certain minimum conditions and tolerances, as set out in Annexes I and II to Directive 2002/56/EC, should be updated and restrictions concerning black scurf, powdery scab and seed potatoes, which have become excessively dehydrated and shrivelled, should be added in Annex II.
(5) Since the adoption of Directive 2002/56/EC, scientific knowledge has developed concerning the link between the number of generations and the level of presence of pests of seed potatoes. Limiting the number of generations is a necessary way of mitigating the phytosanitary risk posed by pests in latent form. That limitation is necessary for the mitigation of that risk, and no other less stringent measures are available to replace it. A maximum of seven generations for pre-basic and basic seed potatoes achieves a balance between the need to multiply sufficient numbers of seed potatoes for the production of certified seed potatoes, and the protection of their health status.
(6) The requirements concerning the harmful organism Synchytrium endobioticum (Schilb.)

At the same time knowledge about new disease agents has become available and knowledge about existing diseases has evolved showing that some diseases require stricter measures.\n\n((3)) Against this background, the standard of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the marketing and commercial quality control of seed potatoes has been adapted in view of those technical and scientific developments(2).\n\n((4)) Taking into account those developments, certain minimum conditions and tolerances, as set out in Annexes I and II to Directive 2002/56/EC, should be updated and restrictions concerning black scurf, powdery scab and seed potatoes, which have become excessively dehydrated and shrivelled, should be added in Annex II.\n\n((5)) Since the adoption of Directive 2002/56/EC, scientific knowledge has developed concerning the link between the number of generations and the level of presence of pests of seed potatoes. Limiting the number of generations is a necessary way of mitigating the phytosanitary risk posed by pests in latent form. That limitation is necessary for the mitigation of that risk, and no other less stringent measures are available to replace it. A maximum of seven generations for pre-basic and basic seed potatoes achieves a balance between the need to multiply sufficient numbers of seed potatoes for the production of certified seed potatoes, and the protection of their health status.\n\n((6)) The requirements concerning the harmful organismSynchytrium endobioticum (Schilb.)

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in the Agreement concluded between the Community and Switzerland, and approved by Decision  86/559/EEC  (1), the Community undertook to open each year, subject to certain conditions, a  Community tariff quota at zero rate of duty for table cherries originating in this country; whereas  this tariff quota should be opened, and, where necessary, the conditions of eligibility laid down  should be specified; whereas, for reasons of simplification, provision should be made to empower  the Commission to give effect, following receipt of the opinion of the Customs Code Committee, to  necessary amendments and technical adaptations of this Regulation arising from amendments of the  combined nomenclature and Taric codes and to adaptations of the volume, periods and quota rate  arising from decisions by the Council;
Whereas the tariff quota provided in the Agreement in question relates to an indefinite period and  accordingly, for reasons of efficiency and simplifying the implementation of the measures  concerned, it appears suitable to provide that the application of this Regulation should be placed  on a multiannual footing;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and the prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white sugar and raw sugar, non-denatured and exported without further processing, are being fixed, account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar, and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavour or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/11/EC(2), and in particular Article 7(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Auto-Oil programmes, which were initiated in 1992 to provide the analytical foundation for the setting of vehicle emission and fuel quality standards for the year 2000 and beyond, in order to achieve air quality objectives with a particular focus on reducing road transport emissions, identified the standard of motor vehicle maintenance as a key factor in the effect of traffic on air quality.
(2) Directive 96/96/EC specifies the tests to be carried out at periodic inspections to check that emissions from both petrol and diesel driven vehicles are still within acceptable limits.
(3) A working group of experts from the International Motor Vehicle Inspection Committee (CITA), and from other relevant organisations was established by the Commission and met during year 2000. The group examined the options for amending the limits for the emission tests prescribed in Directive 96/96/EC and in Directive 2000/30/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community(3) to determine whether improved environmental benefits could be realised. The Group concluded that the currently prescribed limits are invariably well above what the vehicle is capable of achieving in practice, provided that it is properly maintained: the current limits are therefore not as effective as they could be in facilitating the detection of gross emitters, i.e. vehicles whose exhaust emissions are at least 50 % more than would be expected from a properly maintained vehicle.
(4) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the committee for the adaptation to technical progress of the Directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers instituted by Article 8 of Directive 96/96/EC,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2003/27/EC of 3 April 2003 on adapting to technical progress Council Directive 96/96/EC as regards the testing of exhaust emissions from motor vehicles (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex II to Directive 96/96/EC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Exhaust emissions\n\n8.2.1. Motor vehicles equipped with positive-ignition engines and fuelled by petrol\n\n(a) Where the exhaust emissions are not controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter that is lambda-probe controlled:\n\n1. Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2. Visual inspection of any emission control equipment fitted by the manufacturer in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\nAfter a reasonable period of engine conditioning (taking account of manufacturer\'s recommendations) the carbon monoxide (CO) content of the exhaust gases is measured when the engine is idling (no load).\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available or where the Member States\' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference value, the CO content must not exceed the following:\n\n(i) for vehicles registered or put into service for the first time between the date from which Member States required the vehicles to comply with Directive 70/220/EEC(1) and 1 October 1986: CO - 4,5 % vol.\n\n(ii) For vehicles registered or put into service for the first time after 1 October 1986 - 3,5 % vol.\n\n(b) Where the exhaust emissions are controlled by an advanced emission control system such as a three-way catalytic converter that is lambda-probe controlled:\n\n1. Visual inspection of the exhaust system in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2.

Determination of the efficiency of the vehicle\'s emission control system by measuring the lambda value and the CO content of the exhaust gases in accordance with section 4 or with the procedures proposed by the manufacturers and approved at the time of type-approval. For each of the tests the engine is conditioned in accordance with the vehicle manufacturer\'s recommendations.\n\n4. Exhaust pipe emissions - limit values\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases is that stated by the vehicle manufacturer. Where this information is not available the CO content must not exceed the following:\n\n(i) Measurement at engine idling speed:\n\nThe maximum permissible CO content in the exhaust gases must not exceed 0,5 % vol. and for vehicles that have been type-approved according to the limit values shown in row A or row B of the table in section 5.3.1.4. of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC(2) or later amendments the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,3 % vol. Where identification to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC is not possible then the above shall apply to vehicles registered or first put into service after 1 July 2002.\n\n(ii) Measurement at high idle speed (no load), engine speed to be at least 2000 min-1:\n\nCO content: maximum 0,3 % vol. and for vehicles that have been type-approved according to the limit values shown in row A or row B of the table in section 5.3.1.4. of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC or later amendments the maximum CO content must not exceed 0,2 % vol. Where identification to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC is not possible then the above shall apply to vehicles registered or first put into service after 1 July 2002.\n\nLambda: 1± 0,03 or in accordance with the manufacturer\'s specifications.\n\n(iii) For motor vehicles equipped with on-board diagnostic systems (OBD) in accordance with Directive 70/220/EEC (as amended by Directive 98/69/EC and subsequent amendments) Member States may as an alternative to the test specified in item (i) establish the correct functioning of the emission system through the appropriate reading of the OBD device and the simultaneous checking of the proper functioning of the OBD system.\n\n8.2.2. Motor vehicles equipped with compression-ignition (diesel) engines\n\n(a) Exhaust gas opacity to be measured during free acceleration (no load from idle up to cut-off speed) with gear lever in neutral and clutch engaged.\n\n(b) Vehicle preconditioning:\n\n1. Vehicles may be tested without preconditioning although for safety reasons checks should be made that the engine is warm and in a satisfactory mechanical condition.\n\n2. Except as specified in subparagraph (d)(5), no vehicle will be failed unless it has been preconditioned according to the following requirements:\n\n(i) Engine shall be fully warm, for instance the engine oil temperature measured by a probe in the oil level dipstick tube to be at least 80 °C, or normal operating temperature if lower, or the engine block temperature measured by the level of infrared radiation to be at least an equivalent temperature. If, owing to vehicle configuration, this measurement is impractical, the establishment of the engine\'s normal operating temperature may be made by other means, for example by the operation of the engine cooling fan.\n\n(ii) Exhaust system shall be purged by at least three free acceleration cycles or by an equivalent method.\n\n(c) Test procedure:\n\n1. Visual inspection of any emission control equipment fitted by the manufacturer in order to check that it is complete and in a satisfactory condition and that there are no leaks.\n\n2. Engine and any turbocharger fitted, to be at idle before the start of each free acceleration cycle. For heavy-duty diesels, this means waiting for at least 10 seconds after the release of the throttle.\n\n3. To initiate each free acceleration cycle, the throttle pedal must be fully depressed quickly and continuously (in less than one second) but not violently, so as to obtain maximum delivery from the injection pump.\n\n4. During each free acceleration cycle, the engine shall reach cut-off speed or, for vehicles with automatic transmissions, the speed specified by the manufacturer or if this data is not available then two thirds of the cut-off speed, before the throttle is released. This could be checked, for instance, by monitoring engine speed or by allowing a sufficient time to elapse between initial throttle depression and release, which in the case of vehicles of category 1 and 2 of Annex 1, should be at least two seconds.\n\n(d) Limit values:\n\n1. The level of concentration must not exceed the level recorded on the plate pursuant to Directive 72/306/EEC(3).\n\n2. Where this information is not available or where Member States\' competent authorities decide not to use it as a reference, the level of concentration must not exceed the level stated by the manufacturer or the limit values of the coefficient of absorption that are as follows:\n\nMaximum coefficient of absorption for:\n\n- naturally aspirated diesel engines = 2,5 m-1\n\n- turbo-charged diesel engines = 3,0 m-1\n\n- a limit of 1,5 m-1 shall apply to the following vehicles that have been type-approved according to the limit values shown in:\n\n(a) row B of the table in section 5.3.1.4 of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC - (Light Duty Vehicle Diesel - Euro4);\n\n(b) row B1 of the tables in section 6.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 88/77/EEC, as amended by Directive 1999/96/EC(4) - (Heavy Duty Vehicle Diesel - Euro4);\n\n(c) row B2 of the tables in section 6.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 88/77/EEC, as amended by Directive 1999/96/EC - (Heavy Duty Vehicle Diesel - Euro5);\n\n(d) row C of the tables in section 6.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 88/77/EEC, as amended by Directive 1999/96/EC - (Heavy Duty Vehicle - EEV)\n\nor limit values in later amendments of Directive 70/220/EEC as amended by Directive 98/69/EC, or limit values in later amendments of Directive 88/77/EEC as amended by Directive 1999/96/EC, or equivalent values where use is made of equipment of a type different from that used for EC type-approval.\n\nWhere identification to section 5.3.1.4 of Annex I to Directive 70/220/EEC, as amended by Directive 98/69/EC or to section 6.2.1 of Annex I to Directive 88/77/EEC, as amended by Directive 1999/96/EC is not possible then the above shall apply to vehicles registered or first put into service after 1 July 2008.\n\n3. Vehicles registered or put into service for the first time before 1 January 1980 are exempted from these requirements.\n\n4. Vehicles shall only be failed if the arithmetic means of at least the last three free acceleration cycles are in excess of the limit value. This may be calculated by ignoring any measurement that departs significantly from the measured mean, or the result of any other statistical calculation that takes account of the scattering of the measurements. Member States may limit the number of test cycles.\n\n5. To avoid unnecessary testing, Member States may, by way of exception from the provisions of paragraph 8.2.2(d)(4), fail vehicles which have measured values significantly in excess of the limit values after less than three free acceleration cycles or after the purging cycles (or equivalent) specified in subparagraph 8.2.2(b)2(ii). Equally to avoid unnecessary testing, Member States may, by way of exception from the provisions of 8.2.2(d)(4) pass vehicles which have measured values significantly below the limits after less than three free acceleration cycles or after the purging cycles (or equivalent) specified in subparagraph 8.2.2(b)2(ii).\n\n8.2.3. Test equipment\n\nVehicle emissions are tested using equipment designed to establish accurately whether the limit values prescribed or indicated by the manufacturer have been complied with.\n\n8.2.4. Where, during EC type-approval, a type of vehicle is found not to have satisfied the limit values laid down by this directive, the Member States may lay down higher limit values for that type of vehicle on the basis of proof supplied by the manufacturer. They must forthwith inform the Commission thereof and it in turn must inform the other Member States.""\n\n(1) OJ L 76, 9.3.1970, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 350, 28.12.1998, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 190, 20.8.1972, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 44, 16.2.2000, p. 1.'}]}"

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as amended by Directive 2000/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/31/EEC of 14 June 1993 on stands for two-wheel motor vehicles(3), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 93/31/EEC is one of the separate directives under the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC. The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to that Directive.

Whereas, under the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 an aid system was introduced for the use of grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in wine-growing zones C III (a) and C III (b) for the preparation in the United Kingdom and Ireland of certain products, falling within CN code 2206 and for the use of concentrated grape musts produced in the Community for the manufacture of certain products marketed in the United Kingdom and in Ireland with instructions for obtaining from them a beverage in imitation of wine;
Whereas the products falling within CN code 2206 referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of the abovementioned Regulation are at the moment produced exclusively from concentrated grape must; whereas, at present, aid should therefore be fixed for the use of concentrated grape must alone;
Whereas implementation of the aid system requires administrative arrangements for checking both the origin of the products for which aid is given and the use to which they are put;

Whereas, so that the aid system can have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity for which applications may be submitted should be fixed;

Whereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas, to allow for technical losses, the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;
Whereas for technical reasons operators lay in their stocks a long time before manufacturing the marketed products; whereas arrangements should accordingly be made to enable advance payment of the aid to be made to operators, the competent authorities being guaranteed by an appropriate security against the risk of incorrect payment; whereas the period within which advance payment is to be made and the procedure for release of the security should be specified;

","Council Regulation (EC) No 1146/2001
of 11 June 2001
concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Liberia
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 301 thereof,
Having regard to Council Common Position 2001/357/CFSP of 7 May 2001 concerning restrictive measures against Liberia(1),
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 7 March the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1343(2001), hereinafter referred to as UNSCR 1343(2001), voicing serious concern at the role played by Liberian authorities in respect of the conflict in Sierra Leone.
(2) The Security Council decided inter alia that all States should take the necessary measures to prevent Liberia from being provided with technical training or assistance to military activities related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of arms and related material. On 4 May 2001 the Security Council established that the Liberian authorities did not comply with the requests from the UNSC. The necessary measures should therefore also be taken to prevent the imports of rough diamonds from Liberia, whether or not such diamonds originate in Liberia.
(3) Some of these measures fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the territory of the Community is concerned. For the purpose of this Regulation, the territory of the Community is deemed to encompass the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.
(4) The Commission and the Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, and cooperate with the Committee established by paragraph 14 of UNSCR 1343(2001), in particular by supplying information to it.
(5) Violations of the provisions of this Regulation should be subject to sanctions and Member States should impose appropriate sanctions to that end. It is, moreover, desirable that sanctions for violations of the provisions of this Regulation can be imposed as from the date of entry into force of this Regulation and that Member States institute proceedings against any persons, entities or bodies under their jurisdiction that have violated any of the said provisions,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1146/2001 of 11 June 2001 concerning certain restrictive measures in respect of Liberia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For disodium phosphonate the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2008/953/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC France received on 11 February 2008 an application from ISK BioSciences Europe N.V. for the inclusion of the active substance disodium phosphonate in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2008/953/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 27 August 2009.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter 'the Authority'). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance disodium phosphonate (4) on 22 April 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 16 July 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for disodium phosphonate.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing disodium phosphonate may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the use which was examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve disodium phosphonate.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing disodium phosphonate. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 of 14 June 1993 fixing the non-rotational  set-aside rate referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92  (1), and in particular  Article 3 thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 2336/95 of 26 September 1995 derogating from Regulation (EEC) No  1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops as regards the  set-aside requirement for the 1996/97 marketing year  (2) fixed the set-aside requirement for  rotational set-aside and for all other forms of set-aside at 10  %; whereas, nevertheless, for  producers who transfer their set-aside requirement to another producer in accordance with Article 7   (7), second indent, of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92  (3), as last amended by Regulation  (EC) No 2800/95  (4), the rate for rotational set-aside is increased by 5  %; whereas, however,  this increase is reduced to 3  % for cases covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93; whereas it is  therefore necessary to determine which cases are covered by the latter Regulation;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 authorized a non rotational setaside rate of an  additional three percentage points on the rotational rate for land set-aside for the 1994/95 and  1995/96 marketing years in a Member State where the area to be entered into set aside in the first  year of the scheme was forecast to exceed 13  % of its base area; whereas during that period the  Commission was required to carry out a study in order to ascertain the effects of rotation on  yields in Member States which qualified; whereas it was intended that the decision would be taken,  on the basis of such report, as to the rate which should apply in such Member States as from the  1996/97 marketing year;
Whereas the United Kingdom satisfied the criterion set out above; whereas the Commission carried  out a study in the United Kingdom; whereas the results of that study are inconclusive because of  the very low number of producers who effected non-rotational set-aside, and because the data for  the second of the two marketing years is not yet available;
Whereas there is currently no sound basis on which to determine whether or not the three additional  percentage points afford the same guarantee in terms of production control as the rate adopted for  rotational set-aside; whereas the results of the study which are currently available do not,  however, exclude this possibility;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 also authorizes a non-rotational set-aside rate of an  additional three percentage points on the rotational rate in the vulnerable zones referred to in  Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against  pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural souces  (5), or in the whole of the territory of a  Member State which applies the action programmes in the Directive to the whole of its territory;  whereas such authorization is conditional on the Commission accepting that there is a significant  reduction in the use of fertilizers in the Member State concerned; whereas the Commission was  required to draw up a report at the end of the 1995/96 marketing year concerning the effect on  production; whereas until the report is completed, no definitive conclusions can be drawn; whereas  however the Commission recognizes that the reduction in the use of fertilizers in Denmark can be  considered to be significant, which applies the action programmes provided for in Directive  91/676/EEC;
Whereas producers in Denmark and the United Kingdom should, for the marketing year 1996/97, be  treated as cases covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1541/93 for the purposes of transfers of their  set-aside requirement;

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas lemons are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas lemons harvested during a given crop year are marketed from June to May of the next year; whereas reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period 1 June to 31 May of the following year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of the abovementioned Regulation stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State with regard to Article 23 (2) plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production  costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (3), and in particular Article 17(2), Articles 22 and 25 and Article 61(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down implementing measures for certain products under Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and for the organisation of official controls under Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, derogating from Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (4) lays down model animal health certificates for the introduction into the Union of certain aquatic animals and products of animal origin intended for human consumption.
(2) The model health certificate for imports of fishery products intended for human consumption, set out in Appendix IV of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005, contains an animal health attestation with regard to the requirements for susceptible species to certain diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, including epizootic ulcerative syndrome.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 of 12 December 2008 implementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards conditions and certification requirements for the placing on the market and the import into the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof and laying down a list of vector species (5) lays down animal health conditions and certification requirements for imports into the Union of certain aquaculture animals and of certain products thereof.
(4) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 sets out a list of vector species for the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC. The vector species for epizootic ulcerative syndrome are currently included in that list.
(5) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 sets out, inter alia, the list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which the import into the Union of ornamental fish susceptible to one or more of the diseases listed in Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC and intended for closed ornamental facilities is permitted.
(6) India and Vietnam are listed in that Annex to make the import of fish species susceptible to epizootic ulcerative syndrome subject to specific animal health provisions eliminating the risks of that disease.
(7) In addition, the model animal health certificates set out in Parts A and B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 contain animal health attestations with regard to the requirements for susceptible species and vector species to certain diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, including epizootic ulcerative syndrome.
(8) Directive 2006/88/EC, as amended by Commission Implementing Directive 2012/31/EU (6), no longer lists epiizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) as an exotic disease in Part II of Annex IV thereto.
(9) For reasons of consistency and clarity of Union law, Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should be amended in order to remove the provisions therein making references to epizootic ulcerative syndrome.
(10) Following the removal of epizootic ulcerative syndrome from the list in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC the corresponding animal health provisions applicable to India and Vietnam have become redundant and therefore those countries should be removed from the list of countries that are to apply disease specific animal health measures to aquatic animals intended for export to the Union.
(11) Thailand is listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, as a third county from which imports of cyprinidae intended for farming, relaying areas, put and take fisheries and open and closed ornamental facilities into the Union is permitted. Thailand has request to be listed in Annex III for the purposes of permitting exports of also other fish species from that third country into the Union.
(12) An inspection by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) concerning aquatic animal health was carried out in Thailand in November 2009. The FVO recommendations following that inspection have been satisfactorily implemented by the competent authority in Thailand. It is therefore appropriate to permit imports into the Union from that third country also of other fish species. The entry for Thailand in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

The vector species for epizootic ulcerative syndrome are currently included in that list.\n\n((5)) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 sets out,inter alia, the list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which the import into the Union of ornamental fish susceptible to one or more of the diseases listed in Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC and intended for closed ornamental facilities is permitted.\n\n((6)) India and Vietnam are listed in that Annex to make the import of fish species susceptible to epizootic ulcerative syndrome subject to specific animal health provisions eliminating the risks of that disease.\n\n((7)) In addition, the model animal health certificates set out in Parts A and B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 contain animal health attestations with regard to the requirements for susceptible species and vector species to certain diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, including epizootic ulcerative syndrome.\n\n((8)) Directive 2006/88/EC, as amended by Commission Implementing Directive 2012/31/EU(6), no longer lists epiizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS) as an exotic disease in Part II of Annex IV thereto.\n\n((9)) For reasons of consistency and clarity of Union law, Regulation (EC) No 2074/2005 and Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should be amended in order to remove the provisions therein making references to epizootic ulcerative syndrome.\n\n((10)) Following the removal of epizootic ulcerative syndrome from the list in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC the corresponding animal health provisions applicable to India and Vietnam have become redundant and therefore those countries should be removed from the list of countries that are to apply disease specific animal health measures to aquatic animals intended for export to the Union.\n\n((11)) Thailand is listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, as a third county from which imports of cyprinidae intended for farming, relaying areas, put and take fisheries and open and closed ornamental facilities into the Union is permitted.

DIRECTIVE 2005/84/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 14 December 2005
amending for the 22nd time Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (phthalates in toys and childcare articles)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 14 of the Treaty establishes an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured.
(2) Work on the internal market should improve the quality of life, health protection and consumer safety. This Directive complies with the requirements of ensuring a high level of health protection and of consumer protection in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities.
(3) The use of certain phthalates in toys and childcare articles made of plasticised material or including parts made of plasticised material should be prohibited as the presence of certain phthalates presents or could potentially present risks related to the health of children. Toys and childcare articles which, although not intended for that purpose, can be put in the mouth, may under certain circumstances present a risk to the health of small children if they are made of plasticised material, or include parts made of plasticised material, which contains certain phthalates.
(4) The Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE), after being consulted by the Commission, has delivered opinions on the health risks raised by these phthalates.
(5) Commission Recommendation 98/485/EC of 1 July 1998 on childcare articles and toys intended to be placed in the mouth by children of less than three years of age, made of soft PVC containing certain phthalates (4), invited Member States to take measures to ensure a high level of child health protection with regard to these products.
(6) Since 1999, the use of six phthalates in toys and childcare articles intended to be placed in the mouth by children under the age of three is subject to a temporary ban at European Union level following the adoption of Commission Decision 1999/815/EC (5) in the framework of Council Directive 92/59/EEC of 29 June 1992 on general product safety (6). This Decision is being renewed regularly.
(7) Limitations already adopted by certain Member States on the placing on the market of toys and childcare articles because of their phthalate content directly affect the completion and functioning of the internal market. It is therefore necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and consequently to amend Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC (7).
(8) The precautionary principle should be applied where scientific evaluation does not allow the risk to be determined with sufficient certainty in order to ensure a high level of protection of health, in particular for children.
(9) Children as developing organisms are particularly vulnerable to reprotoxic substances. Therefore, the exposure of children to all practically avoidable sources of emissions of these substances, especially from articles which are put into the mouth by children, should be reduced as far as possible.
(10) During risk assessments and/or within the framework of Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (8), di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) have been identified as reprotoxic substances and have therefore been classified as reprotoxic, category 2.
(11) Scientific information regarding di-isononyl phthalate (DINP), di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP) and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP) is either lacking or conflictual, but it cannot be excluded that they pose a potential risk if used in toys and childcare articles, which are by definition produced for children.
(12) The uncertainties in the evaluation of exposure to these phthalates, such as mouthing times and exposure to emissions from other sources, require that precautionary considerations be taken into account. Therefore, restrictions on the use of these phthalates for toys and childcare articles and on the placing on the market of such articles should be introduced. However, the restrictions for DINP, DIDP and DNOP should be less severe than the ones proposed for DEHP, DBP and BBP for reasons of proportionality.
(13) The Commission should review other applications of articles made from plasticised material or including parts made from plasticised material which may expose people to risks, especially those used in medical devices.
(14) In line with the Commission Communication on the Precautionary Principle, the measures based on this principle should be subject to review in the light of new scientific information.
(15) The Commission, in cooperation with the Member State authorities responsible for market surveillance and enforcement for toys and childcare articles, and in consultation with the relevant organisations of producers and importers, should monitor the use of phthalates and other substances as plasticisers in toys and childcare articles.
(16) For the purpose of Directive 76/769/EEC, the term ‘childcare article’ should be defined.
(17) In accordance with paragraph 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-making (9), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.
(18) The Commission will review the use of the phthalates listed in Annex I to Directive 76/769/EEC in other products when the risk evaluation under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances (10) will have been concluded.
(19) This Directive applies without prejudice to Community legislation laying down minimum requirements for the protection of workers contained in Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (11) and in individual directives based thereon, in particular Council Directive 90/394/EEC of 28 June 1990 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens at work (12) and Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on protection of health and safety of workers from the risk related to chemical agents at work (13),","{'header': '27.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/40', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2005/84/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14\xa0December 2005\namending for the 22nd time Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (phthalates in toys and\xa0childcare articles)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article\xa014 of the Treaty establishes an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and\xa0capital is ensured.\n\n((2)) Work on the internal market should improve the quality of life, health protection and\xa0consumer safety.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.

Whereas:
(1) Decision 1999/870/EC(1) authorised the Deputy Secretary-General of the Council to act, in the context of the integration of the Schengen acquis within the European Union, as representative of certain Member States for the purposes of concluding contracts relating to the installation and the functioning of the communication infrastructure for the Schengen environment, ""Sisnet"", and to manage such contracts.
(2) The financial obligations arising under those contracts are not borne by the general budget of the European Communities. Therefore, the provisions of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(2) do not apply.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and the prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white sugar and raw sugar, non-denatured and exported without further processing, are being fixed, account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar, and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavour or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(8) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the re-importation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 460/2003 of 13 March 2003 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar without further processing', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe refunds to be granted on exports of the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, non-denatured and without further processing, are hereby fixed in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 14 March 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 March 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26.\n\n(3) OJ L 214, 8.9.1995, p. 16.\n\nANNEX\n\nREFUNDS ON WHITE SUGAR AND RAW SUGAR EXPORTED WITHOUT FURTHER PROCESSING\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1.).\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1779/2002 (OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are:\n\nS00: all destinations (third countries, other territories, victualling and destinations treated as exports from the Community) with the exception of Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo, as defined in UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999) and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, save for sugar incorporated in the products referred to in Article 1(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 (OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29).'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) The preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007 (3). That preparation was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 as a feed additive for laying hens and, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, for a new use in water for drinking, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 1 July 2014 (4) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority further concluded that the use of the preparation has the potential to increase laying intensity and improve the feed-to-egg mass ratio. It considered that the results are independent of the mode of administration provided that the exposure in water for drinking is the same by an equivalent dose to feed. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of the preparation of Lactobacillus acidophilus CECT 4529 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) As a consequence of the granting of a new authorisation under Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, Regulation (EC) No 1520/2007 should be amended accordingly.
(7) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/98(2), and in particular Article 7(3) thereof,
(1) Whereas the application of intervention measures in respect of beef has resulted in a build-up of stocks in several Member States; whereas outlets for those products exist in certain third countries; whereas, in order to prevent storage being prolonged excessively, part of those stocks should be put up for sale by periodical tender for export to those countries; whereas, in order to ensure that the products sold are of a uniform quality, the meat put up for sale should have been bought in pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68;
(2) Whereas the sale should be conducted in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 of 4 October 1979 on detailed rules of application for the disposal of beef bought in by intervention agencies(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2417/95(4), and in particular Titles II and III thereof, and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96(6), subject to certain special exceptions on account of the particular use to which the products in question are to be put;
(3) Whereas, in order to ensure that the sales by tender are conducted properly and uniformly, measures in addition to those provided for in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 should be adopted;
(4) Whereas provision should be made for derogations from Article 8(2)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 in view of the administrative difficulties which the application of that point is creating in the Member States concerned; whereas, with a view to better stock management, the Member States should be able to stipulate only certain cold stores or parts thereof for deliveries of the meat sold;
(5) Whereas, for practical reasons, export refunds will not be granted on beef sold under this Regulation; whereas, however, successful tenderers will be required to apply for export licences for the quantity awarded, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2648/98(8);
(6) Whereas, in order to ensure that the beef sold is exported to the eligible third countries, provision should be made for a security to be lodged before the goods are taken over and the primary requirements should be determined;
(7) Whereas products from intervention stocks may in certain cases have undergone several handling operations; whereas, to help ensure satisfactory presentation and marketing, the repackaging of the products should be authorised in certain circumstances;
(8) Whereas Commision Regulation (EC) No 1222/1999(9), should be repealed;
(9) Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1587/1999 of 20 July 1999 on periodical sales by tender of beef held by certain intervention agencies for export and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1222/1999', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Articles 1(2) and 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1845/2001 of 20 September 2001 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 21 September 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 September 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 141, 24.6.1995, p. 12.\n\n(3) OJ L 145, 27.6.1968, p. 12.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 20 September 2001 fixing the representative prices and additional import duties to imports of molasses in the sugar sector\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease(3), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In Article 13(3) of Directive 85/511/EEC provisions are made for emergency vaccination.
(2) The principles provided for in this Article require to balance the decision on resorting to vaccination against basic Community interests which must not be endangered.
(3) Following the reports of outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Ireland, the Commission adopted Decisions 2001/172/EC(4), 2001/208/EC(5), 2001/223/EC(6) and 2001/234/EC(7) concerning certain protection measures with regard to foot-and-mouth disease in the respective Member State.
(4) In addition to the measures within the framework of Directive 85/511/EEC, the Netherlands apply as a precautionary measure the pre-emptive killing of susceptible animals in holdings situated in close proximity to infected or suspect holdings, taking into account the epidemiological situation and the high density of susceptible animals in certain parts of the territory.
(5) Killing of animals for disease reasons must be carried out in accordance with Council Directive 93/119/EEC of 22 December 1993 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killing(8).
(6) Large scale killing of animals of infected or contaminated holdings may quickly exhaust the capacities for safe destruction of carcasses and thereby unavoidably delay the pre-emptive killing and this may lead to the amplification and spread of the virus.
(7) The competent authorities of the Netherlands have presented to the Commission a programme to employ vaccination as an additional instrument to control and eradicate foot-and-mouth disease in connection with the pre-emptive killing of animals of susceptible species. Although the use of vaccine in the framework of pre-emptive killing is only useful where the expected delay in killing exceeds the time required to build-up sufficient immunity to reduce effectively the spread of virus, it should under no circumstances compromise the progress in reducing the number of animals of susceptible species around outbreaks.
(8) In its report of 10 March 1999 the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare made recommendations on the strategy for emergency vaccination against foot-and-mouth disease, which must be taken into account(9).
(9) Recourse to any kind of vaccination will inevitably jeopardise the foot-and-mouth disease status in terms of international trade not only for the Member State or part of its territory where vaccination is carried out.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 153(2)(b) in conjunction with Article 153(1)(b) and (e) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the European Parliament and the Council may, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for gradual implementation aiming to improve the working conditions and the information and consultation of workers. Such directives must avoid imposing disproportionate costs, or administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way that would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings, which are the drivers of sustainable growth and jobs.
(2) Directives 2008/94/EC (4), 2009/38/EC (5) and 2002/14/EC (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directives 98/59/EC (7) and 2001/23/EC (8), either exclude certain seafarers from their scope or allow Member States to exclude them.
(3) In its Communication of 21 January 2009 entitled ‘Strategic goals and recommendations for the EU's maritime transport policy until 2018’, the Commission emphasised the importance of establishing an integrated legal framework in order to make the maritime sector more competitive.
(4) The existence of, and/or possibility of introducing, exclusions may prevent seafarers from fully enjoying their rights to fair and just working conditions and to information and consultation, or limit the full enjoyment of those rights. Insofar as the existence of, and/or possibility of introducing, exclusions is not justified on objective grounds and seafarers are not treated equally, provisions which allow such exclusions should be deleted.
(5) The present legal situation, existing in part as a result of the specific nature of the seafaring profession, gives rise to unequal treatment of the same category of workers by different Member States, according to whether or not they apply the exclusions and optional exclusions allowed by the legislation in force. A significant number of the Member States have made no, or only limited, use of those optional exclusions.
(6) In its Communication of 10 October 2007 entitled ‘An Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union’, the Commission outlined that such a policy is based on the clear recognition that all matters relating to Europe's oceans and seas are interlinked, and that sea-related policies must develop in a joined-up way if they are to achieve the desired results. It also stressed the need for an increase in the number and quality of maritime jobs for citizens of the Union and the importance of improving working conditions on board, inter alia, through investment in research, education, training, health and safety.
(7) This Directive is in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy and its employment objectives and with the strategy set out by the Commission in its Communication of 23 November 2010 entitled ‘An Agenda for new skills and jobs: A European contribution towards full employment’.
(8) The so-called blue economy represents a substantial share of the Union economy in terms of jobs and gross added value.
(9) In accordance with Article 154(2) TFEU, the Commission has consulted the social partners at the Union level on the possible direction of Union action in this field.
(10) In the framework of their social dialogue, the social partners in the maritime sector have reached a common understanding which is of major importance for this Directive. That common understanding strikes a good balance between the need to improve seafarers' working conditions and the need to take proper account of the sector's specific features.
(11) Considering the particular nature of the maritime sector and the particular working conditions of the workers affected by the exclusions deleted by this Directive, it is necessary to adapt some of the provisions of the Directives that are amended by this Directive to reflect the specificities of the sector concerned.
(12) Having regard to the technological developments of recent years, in particular as regards communications technology, the information and consultation requirements should be updated and applied in the most appropriate manner, including by using new technologies for remote communication and by enhancing the availability of the internet and ensuring its reasonable use on board, in order to improve the implementation of this Directive.
(13) The rights of seafarers covered by this Directive which are afforded by the Member States in the national legislation implementing Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC should not be affected. The implementation of this Directive should not serve to justify any regression in relation to the situation which already prevails in each Member State.
(14) The Maritime Labour Convention of 2006 of the International Labour Organization aims to achieve both decent working and living conditions for seafarers by providing for health and safety standards, fair terms of employment and professional training, and secure fair competition for ship owners through its global application as well as to guarantee an international level playing field with regard to some, but not all, employees' rights, regardless of nationality or vessel flag. That Convention, Council Directive 2009/13/EC (9) and Directives 2009/16/EC (10) and 2013/54/EU (11) of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down seafarers' rights to decent working conditions in a wide range of areas, provide coherent rights and protection at work for seafarers, and contribute to a level playing field including within the Union.
(15) The Union should strive to improve working and living conditions on board ships, and to exploit the potential for innovation in order to make the maritime sector more attractive to Union seafarers, including young workers.
(16) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to improve the working conditions of seafarers and their information and consultation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(17) This Directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to fair and just working conditions and to information and consultation within the undertaking. This Directive should be implemented in accordance with those rights and principles.
(18) Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '8.10.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 263/1', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/1794 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 6 October 2015\namending Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC and 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, and Council Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC, as regards seafarers\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the European Parliament and the Council may, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for gradual implementation aiming to improve the working conditions and the information and consultation of workers.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 (1), and in particular Article 18(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2006/594/EC (2), as amended by Decision 2007/191/EC (3), the Commission fixed an indicative allocation by Member State of the commitment appropriations for the Convergence Objective for the period 2007 to 2013.
(2) In accordance with paragraph 10 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, in 2010 it has been established that the cumulated GDP for the years 2007 to 2009 in the Czech Republic, in Poland and in Slovakia has each diverged by more than ± 5 % from the cumulated GDP estimated in accordance with paragraph 9 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, including as a consequence of exchange rate changes. The amounts allocated for the period 2011 to 2013 to the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia should therefore be adjusted accordingly.
(3) In accordance with points 16 and 17 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (4) on 16 April 2010 the Commission adopted the Communication on the technical adjustment of the financial framework for 2011 in line with movements in GNI, including the adjustment of amounts allocated from funds supporting cohesion to the Member States concerned by divergence between estimated and actual GDP for the period 2007-2009 (5), by which it informed that a positive adjustment is necessary for the Czech Republic of EUR 237 045 801, for Poland of EUR 632 392 153 and for Slovakia of EUR 137 711 534, to be shared in equal amounts in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
(4) In order to establish the amounts allocated to the Member States concerned, it is necessary to take into account the pro-rata allocation between the Convergence and Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in the current programming period 2007-2013 for each of the Member States concerned and the need to make the most efficient use of the allocation of the funds to projects currently being implemented. Therefore, this Decision should allocate only the part of the overall positive adjustments concerning the Convergence objective.
(5) For reasons of efficiency, it is appropriate to replace the amounts in the row Total of Table 2 of Annex III to Decision 2006/594/EC for the years 2007 to 2010 since they do not reflect the figures given for Bulgaria.

(2008/832/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes bromuconazole.
(3) For bromuconazole the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For bromuconazole the rapporteur Member State was Belgium and all relevant information was submitted on 14 November 2005.
(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group Evaluation and presented to the Commission on 26 March 2008 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance bromuconazole (4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 July 2008 in the format of the Commission review report for bromuconazole.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. In particular, based on the available information, it was not possible to assess the potential contamination of surface water and groundwater. Moreover, with regard to ecotoxicology, there are concerns due to the high risk to aquatic organisms. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that bromuconazole met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing bromuconazole satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Bromuconazole should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing bromuconazole are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing bromuconazole should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing bromuconazole remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for bromuconazole according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the detailed implementation rules of which have been laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (5), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.

However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing bromuconazole satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((7)) Bromuconazole should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((8)) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing bromuconazole are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n\n((9)) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing bromuconazole should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing bromuconazole remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.\n\n((10)) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for bromuconazole according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the detailed implementation rules of which have been laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008(5), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nBromuconazole shall not be included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall ensure that:\n(a)\nauthorisations for plant protection products containing bromuconazole are withdrawn by 3 May 2009;\n(b)\nno authorisations for plant protection products containing bromuconazole are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nAny period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article\xa04(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire on 3 May 2010 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1) and in particular Article 64(2) and Article 186, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) During the 2011/2012 sugar marketing year, the Union average bulk white sugar ex-factory price reached a level of 175 % of the reference price of EUR 404 per tonne and was approximately EUR 275 per tonne higher than the world market price. The Union price is now stable at a level of around EUR 700 per tonne, which is the highest level reached since the reform of the sugar market organisation and disturbs the optimal fluidity of the sugar supply on the Union market. The expected increase of this already high price level during the 2012/2013 marketing year substantiates the risk of serious market disturbances which should be prevented by the necessary measures.
(2) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/2013, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 0,5 million tonne than in 2011/2012. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.
(3) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 5 400 000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/2013 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 2 000 000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.
(4) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/2013.
(5) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.
(6) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota (2) has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.
(7) For a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, a reduced surplus levy should be fixed at a level per tonne allowing for a fair treatment of Union sugar producers, ensuring the good functioning of the Union sugar market and helping to reduce the difference between Union and world market sugar prices without creating risks of accumulation of surpluses in the Union market.
(8) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar.
(9) With a view to increasing the supply, sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market with a reduced surplus levy.
(10) The reduced surplus levy should be paid after the application is admitted and before the certificate is issued.
(11) The validity of the certificates should be limited in time to encourage a fast improvement of the supply situation.
(12) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant’s own production should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.
(13) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply. The minimum eligibility requirements for applications should be specified.
(14) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received. In order to simplify and standardise those notifications, models should be made available.
(15) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.
(16) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether the quantity applied for was fully or partially granted.
(17) The competent authorities should notify the Commission of the quantities for which certificates with a reduction of the surplus levy have been issued. For this purpose, models should be made available by the Commission.
(18) Sugar quantities released on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates issued under this Regulation should be subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne. This consistent approach is aimed at preventing abuse of the mechanism introduced by this Regulation.
(19) For the purpose of establishing average prices for quota and out-of-quota sugar on the Union market in accordance with Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (3), sugar covered by a certificate issued pursuant to this Regulation should be considered as quota sugar.
(20) In accordance with Article 2(1)(a) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (4) contributions and other duties provided for within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are to constitute own resources. It is therefore necessary to set the date of establishment of the amounts in question within the meaning of Article 2(2) and Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (5).

of 22 December 2009
on support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP among third countries
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 26(2) and Article 31(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 26 June 1997, the Council adopted the EU Programme for Preventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in Conventional Arms, committing the EU and its Member States to take concerted action to assist other countries in preventing and combating the illicit trafficking of arms.
(2) On 8 December 2008, the Council adopted Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment, which lays down eight criteria for the export of conventional arms (1), establishes a notification and consultation mechanism for denials and includes a transparency procedure through the publication of the EU annual reports on arms exports. That Common Position contributes significantly to the harmonisation of national arms export control policies and its principles and criteria have been officially subscribed to by several third countries.
(3) Article 11 of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP states that Member States will use their best endeavours to encourage other arms exporting States to apply the criteria of that Common Position.
(4) The European Security Strategy adopted by Heads of State and Government on 12 December 2003 enunciates five key challenges to be faced by the EU in the post-Cold War environment: terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, regional conflicts, State failure and organised crime. The consequences of the uncontrolled circulation of conventional weapons are central to four of these five challenges. Indeed, the uncontrolled transfer of arms contributes to a worsening of terrorism and organised crime, and is a major factor in triggering and spreading conflicts, as well as in the collapse of State structures. In addition, the Strategy underlines the importance of export controls to contain proliferation.
(5) The International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 2005, aims to enhance the effectiveness of, and complement, existing bilateral, regional and international agreements to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.
(6) The EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, provides that the EU should, at regional and international level, support the strengthening of export controls and the promotion of the criteria of the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, subsequently replaced by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, by, inter alia, helping third countries to draft national legislation on this and promoting measures to improve transparency.
(7) On 6 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of all Member States of the European Union, adopted Resolution 61/89, entitled ‘Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms’. In December 2006 and June and December 2007, the Council adopted conclusions underlining that it is important for the EU and Member States to play an active role and cooperate with other States and regional organisations in the process within the United Nations to establish common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms, which would be a major contribution to tackling the undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms which undermines peace, security, development and full respect for human rights.
(8) On 17 March 2008, the Council adopted Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP on support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports among third countries (2), the last activity under this Joint Action took place on 27 and 28 October 2009,","{'header': '29.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 348/16', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION 2009/1012/CFSP\nof 22 December 2009\non support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP among third countries', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 26 June 1997, the Council adopted the EU Programme for Preventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in Conventional Arms, committing the EU and its Member States to take concerted action to assist other countries in preventing and combating the illicit trafficking of arms.\n\n((2)) On 8 December 2008, the Council adopted Common Position 2008/944/CFSP defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment, which lays down eight criteria for the export of conventional arms(1), establishes a notification and consultation mechanism for denials and includes a transparency procedure through the publication of the EU annual reports on arms exports.

In addition, the Strategy underlines the importance of export controls to contain proliferation.\n\n((5)) The International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 8 December 2005, aims to enhance the effectiveness of, and complement, existing bilateral, regional and international agreements to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects.\n\n((6)) The EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition, adopted by the European Council on 15 and 16 December 2005, provides that the EU should, at regional and international level, support the strengthening of export controls and the promotion of the criteria of the Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, subsequently replaced by Common Position 2008/944/CFSP, by,inter alia, helping third countries to draft national legislation on this and promoting measures to improve transparency.\n\n((7)) On 6 December 2006, the United Nations General Assembly, with the support of all Member States of the European Union, adopted Resolution 61/89, entitled ‘Towards an arms trade treaty: establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms’. In December 2006 and June and December 2007, the Council adopted conclusions underlining that it is important for the EU and Member States to play an active role and cooperate with other States and regional organisations in the process within the United Nations to establish common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms, which would be a major contribution to tackling the undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms which undermines peace, security, development and full respect for human rights.\n\n((8)) On 17 March 2008, the Council adopted Joint Action 2008/230/CFSP on support for EU activities in order to promote the control of arms exports and the principles and criteria of the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports among third countries(2), the last activity under this Joint Action took place on 27 and 28 October 2009,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0For the purposes of the practical implementation of:\n—\nthe European Security Strategy,\n—\nthe EU Strategy to combat illicit accumulation and trafficking of SALW and their ammunition,\n—\nArticle 11 of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP,\n—\nthe EU Programme for Preventing and Combating Illicit Trafficking in Conventional Arms,\n—\nthe International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons, and,\n—\nthe Council Conclusions on a International Arms Trade Treaty,\nthe European Union shall support activities in order to further the following objectives:\n(a)\nto promote, among third countries, the criteria and principles of Common Position 2008/944/CFSP;\n(b)\nto assist third countries in drafting and implementing legislation to ensure effective control of arms exports;\n(c)\nto assist third countries in the training of licensing officers to ensure adequate implementation and enforcement of arms export controls;\n(d)\nto assist third countries and regions in the elaboration of national and regional reports on arms exports and the promotion of other forms of scrutiny in order to promote transparency and accountability of arms exports;\n(e)\nto encourage third countries to support the United Nations process aiming at the adoption of a legally binding international treaty establishing common standards for the global trade in conventional arms, and to assist in ensuring that they are in a position to comply with such possible common standards.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0A description of the projects furthering the objectives, as referred to in paragraph 1, is set out in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR), shall be responsible for the implementation of this Decision.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The technical implementation of the projects referred to in Article 1(2) shall be carried out by the following implementing entity:\nThe German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control, BAFA.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The implementing entity shall perform its tasks under the responsibility of the HR.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 5(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC in conjunction with point 2 of Section I of Part A of Annex IV thereto, Member States shall ban the introduction into the Union of wood packaging material unless it has been subjected to an approved phytosanitary treatment as specified in the International Standard for Phytosanitary Measures No 15 (2) and displays a mark, as specified within the same Standard, indicating that the wood packaging material has been subjected to such a phytosanitary treatment. Pursuant to Article 15(1) of that Directive derogations from those provisions may, however, be provided for if it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms.
(2) Certain wood packaging material of conifers (Coniferales) in the form of boxes actually in use in the transport of ammunition, which were manufactured on 31 August 2007 at the latest and originating from the United States, does not fulfil the conditions set out in Article 5(1) of Directive 2000/29/EC in conjunction with point 2 of Section I of Part A of Annex IV thereto. Hereinafter those boxes are referred to as ‘the boxes’.
(3) The Commission has concluded on the basis of information supplied by the United States that the boxes do not present any risk of spreading harmful organisms, provided that certain conditions are satisfied concerning absence or limited presence of bark, treatment and repair of the boxes as well as their storage and transport.
(4) Therefore, Member States should be authorised to allow the boxes to be introduced into, as well as stored and moved within, their territory provided that the conditions referred to in recital 3 are satisfied, while the provisions of Directive 2000/29/EC should apply after they become empty.
(5) In order to ensure effective controls and overview of the potential phytosanitary risks, any person moving or storing the boxes after the checks provided for in the enacting terms should notify the responsible official body concerning that movement or storage, and the boxes concerned.
(6) Member States should inform each other and the Commission when they become aware of a consignment not complying with the conditions referred to in recital 3. They should, on an annual basis, provide the Commission and the other Member States with information on the imports made, in order to assess the application of this Decision.

Whereas Denmark has shown the existence of exceptional and temporary difficulties in supplying its transforming industry on the Community market with special sheet for the manufacture of preserved-food cans; whereas such difficulties should have disappeared by the end of 1987;

fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '29.4.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 108/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 656/2005\nof 28 April 2005\nfixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(5), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(6), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(7), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(8), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(9) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(10) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(11), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(12) with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, are not eligible for export refunds.

(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Directive 91/414/EEC shall continue to apply to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC before 14 June 2011.
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 29 March 2001 an application from Makhteshim Agan Ltd, for the inclusion of the active substance novaluron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) By Commission Decision 2001/861/EC (3) it was confirmed that, on preliminary examination, the dossier was considered ‘complete’, in that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(4) Member States where thereby given the possibility to grant provisional authorisations, for plant protection products containing novaluron for an initial period of three years, in accordance with Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC. That initial period of three years can start at any time, as soon as an application is assessed.
(5) In accordance with the second sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 11(6) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 of 25 February 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards the procedure for the assessment of active substances which were not on the market 2 years after the date of notification of that Directive (4) the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) asked the rapporteur Member State on 16 June 2011 to request additional information from the applicant.
(6) By letter of 29 February 2012 the applicant informed the United Kingdom, the Authority and the Commission of its intention not to support the evaluation any further and not to submit further data. By the same letter the applicant withdrew its application. Since the additional information requested by the Authority was not submitted, the dossier can no longer be considered to be complete.
(7) Decision 2001/861/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Existing provisional authorisations should, consequently, be withdrawn and no new authorisations granted.
(9) For plant protection products containing novaluron, where Member States grant any period of grace in accordance with Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, this period should expire at the latest one year after the withdrawal of the respective authorisation.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '11.4.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 101/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 4 April 2012\namending Decision 2001/861/EC as regards novaluron\n(notified under document C(2012) 2164)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/187/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Directive 91/414/EEC shall continue to apply to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC before 14 June 2011.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 29 March 2001 an application from Makhteshim Agan Ltd, for the inclusion of the active substance novaluron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((3)) By Commission Decision 2001/861/EC(3)it was confirmed that, on preliminary examination, the dossier was considered ‘complete’, in that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((4)) Member States where thereby given the possibility to grant provisional authorisations, for plant protection products containing novaluron for an initial period of three years, in accordance with Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the European Parliament and Council Directive 98/8/EC of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular Article 16 (2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 16(2) second subparagraph, and (3) of Directive 98/8/EC (hereinafter referred to as ’the Directive’) provide that, where the requisite information and data for the evaluation of an active substance have not been submitted within the prescribed period, it may be decided not to include the active substance in Annexes I, IA or IB of the Directive. Following such a decision, Member States should withdraw all authorisations for biocidal products containing the active substance.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1896/2000 and (EC) No 2032/2003 lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first and second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of the Directive. Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 specifies 1 September 2006 as the date with effect from which Member States shall cancel existing authorisations for biocidal products containing active substances in respect of which there has been neither an accepted notification nor an expression of interest by a Member State.
(3) Article 4a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1048/2005, lays down the conditions under which Member States may apply to the Commission for an extension of the phase-out period laid down in its Article 4(2) and the conditions for granting such an extension.
(4) For some of the active substances for which use in biocidal products shall be prohibited after 1 September 2006, applications for extension of this phase-out period have been submitted by individual Member States to the Commission together with information demonstrating a need for further use of the substances concerned.
(5) Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland have submitted information demonstrating the absence of suitable alternatives to pine tar with regard to its use as a wood protection product on historical wooden buildings, vessels and articles. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate in order to preserve the cultural heritage of these Member States and countries.
(6) The Czech Republic has submitted information demonstrating the highly prevalent use of sodium N-chlorobenzenesulphonamide/Chloramine B as a disinfectant by the Czech armed forces and public health services. Its substitution by other, notified substances might prove problematic if it were to happen by the end of the phase-out period, especially where public procurement procedures need to be carried out. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate to allow for a switch to other disinfectants.
(7) Greece has submitted information demonstrating the prevalent use of temephos for mosquito nuisance and public health control by public authorities. Its substitution by other, notified substances might prove problematic if it were to happen by the end of the phase-out period, especially where public procurement procedures need to be carried out. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate to allow for a switch to other available substances.
(8) The United Kingdom has submitted information demonstrating the need for temporary continuation of use of ammonia as a veterinary hygiene biocidal product to prevent infections by coccidia, cryptosporidium and nematodes in livestock. An extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems appropriate to permit its gradual replacement by other available substances that are notified for evaluation under the Directive's review programme.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 26(2) and Article 31(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 20 July 2001, the States participating in the ad-hoc Conference adopted the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (the Programme of Action). On 8 December 2005, the United Nations General Assembly adopted an International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (International Tracing Instrument). Both these international instruments declare that States will cooperate, as appropriate, with the United Nations to support their effective implementation.
(2) The 2008 Third Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action noted in its final report the importance of regional approaches to the implementation of the Programme of Action and the usefulness, therefore, of convening regional meetings sponsored by interested States and international, regional and sub-regional organisations in a position to do so. The final report also encouraged States to support and make full use of existing mechanisms that support the implementation of the Programme of Action and the matching of needs with resources, such as the Programme of Action Implementation Support System.
(3) On 15-16 December 2005, the European Council adopted the EU Strategy to combat the illicit accumulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons (SALW) and their ammunition (the EU SALW Strategy). The EU SALW Strategy identifies support for the UN Programme of Action as the first priority for action at international level, and calls for the adoption of a legally binding international instrument on the tracing and marking of SALW and ammunition.
(4) Following the adoption of the international tracing instrument, the European Union supported its full implementation through the adoption and implementation of Council Joint Action 2008/113/CFSP of 12 February 2008 in support of the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) (1). The implementation of that Joint Action was positively assessed by the Council of the European Union.
(5) On 2 December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/64/50 on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects which encourages all initiatives, including those of international, regional and sub-regional organisations, for the successful implementation of the Programme of Action and emphasises that initiatives by the international community with respect to international cooperation and assistance remain essential and complementary to national implementation efforts.
(6) Resolution A/RES/64/50 also provided that the fourth biennial meeting of States to consider the national, regional and global implementation of the Programme of Action should be held in New York from 14 to 18 June 2010, and that a conference to review progress made in implementation of the Programme of Action will be convened for a period of 2 weeks in New York, no later than in 2012.
(7) Also on 2 December 2009, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution A/RES/64/51 on Problems arising from the accumulation of conventional ammunition stockpiles in surplus, which encourages States in a position to do so to contribute to the development within the United Nations of technical guidelines for the stockpile management of conventional ammunition, in order to assist States in improving their national stockpile management capacity, preventing the growth of conventional ammunition surpluses,","{'header': '19.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 188/37', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION 2011/428/CFSP\nof 18 July 2011\nin support of United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs activities to implement the United Nations Programme of Actions to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 20 July 2001, the States participating in the ad-hoc Conference adopted the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (the Programme of Action).

(2) As a result of the detection of residues from the pharmacologically active substance malachite green whose use in veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals is not authorised in the Community, and its metabolite leucomalachite green in aquaculture products, the level to be set for harmonised MRPL for that substance has been agreed in consultation with the Community Reference Laboratories, the National Reference Laboratories and the Member States.
(3) It is necessary to provide harmonised levels for the control of that substance to ensure the same level of consumer protection in the Community.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular the second alternative of Article 21(3) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 2006/74/EC (2) included triclopyr as active substance in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC (3), under the condition that the Member States concerned ensure that the notifier at whose request triclopyr was included in that Annex provide further confirmatory information on the risk assessment on acute and long-term exposure for birds and mammals and the risk to aquatic organisms from exposure to the metabolite 6-chloro-2-pyridinol.
(2) Active substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and are listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (4).
(3) The notifier submitted additional information with a view to confirm the risk assessment for birds and mammals and aquatic organisms to the rapporteur Member State Ireland within the time period provided for its submission.
(4) Ireland assessed the additional information submitted by the notifier. It submitted its assessment, in the form of two addenda to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission, and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter ‘the Authority’, on 25 January 2011 and on 22 November 2013.
(5) The Commission considered that the additional information provided by the notifier demonstrated that an unacceptable risk for birds and mammals could not be excluded except by imposing further restrictions.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for triclopyr.
(7) The Commission has concluded that the further confirmatory information required has not fully been provided and that an unacceptable risk for birds and mammals cannot be excluded except by imposing further restrictions.
(8) It is confirmed that the active substance triclopyr is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. In order to minimise the exposure of birds and mammals, it is, however, appropriate to amend the conditions of use of this active substance, in particular by restricting its use.
(9) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing triclopyr.
(11) For plant protection products containing triclopyr, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire, at the latest, 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter ""the Directive"") has provided for the development of a Community list of active substances authorised for use in plant-protection products.
(2) The applicant Menno Chemie Vertriebs-Ges. submitted a dossier for the new active substance benzoic acid to Germany on 25 May 1998.
(3) The applicant BASF Plc submitted a dossier for the new active substance BAS 615H to the United Kingdom on 28 April 1997.
(4) In accordance with the provisions of Article 6(3) of the Directive, the Commission confirmed in its Decision 98/676/EC(3) that the dossier submitted for benzoic acid could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and for a plant protection product containing this active substance, of Annex III to the Directive.
(5) In accordance with the provisions of Article 6(3) of the Directive, the Commission confirmed in its Decision 98/398/EC(4) that the dossier submitted for BAS 615H (cinidon-ethyl) could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and for a plant-protection product containing this active substance, of Annex III to the Directive.
(6) Such confirmation of data and information is necessary to permit a detailed examination of the dossier and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for a period up to three years, for plant-protection products containing the active substance concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of the Directive and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant-protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive.
(7) For benzoic acid the effects on human health and the environment are being assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of the Directive, for the uses proposed by the applicant. Germany acting as nominated rapporteur Member State submitted to the Commission on 12 December 2000 the draft assessment report concerned. The submitted report is being reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and in Working Groups thereof.
(8) For BAS 615H (cinidon-ethyl) the effects on human health and the environment are being assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of the Directive, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The United Kingdom acting as nominated rapporteur Member State submitted to the Commission on 2 November 1998 the draft assessment report concerned. The submitted report is being reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health and in working groups thereof.
(9) It will not be possible to complete the evaluation of the dossiers within three years of the adoption of the Decisions on completeness referred to above because the examination of the dossiers after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States has taken longer than three years.
(10) Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted of plant protection products containing these active substances for a period of 12 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the Directive so as to enable examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that within 12 months the completion of the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 17197 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (1), and in particular Article 5(1)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Directive 2002/95/EC the Commission is required to evaluate certain hazardous substances prohibited pursuant to Article 4(1) of that Directive.
(2) Certain materials and components containing lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) or polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) should be exempt from the prohibition, since the elimination or substitution of these hazardous substances in those specific materials and components is still impracticable.
(3) Since the risk assessment of DecaBDE, under Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances (2), has concluded that there is at present no need for measures to reduce the risks for consumers beyond those which are being applied already, but additional studies are required under the risk assessment, DecaBDE can be exempted until further notice from the requirements of Article 4(1) of Directive 2002/95/EC. Should new evidence lead to a different conclusion of the risk assessment, this decision would be re-examined and amended, if appropriate. In parallel industry is implementing a voluntary emissions reduction programme.
(4) Exemptions from the prohibition for certain specific materials or components should be limited in their scope, in order to achieve a gradual phase-out of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, given that the use of those substances in such applications will become avoidable.
(5) Pursuant to Article 5(1)(c) of Directive 2002/95/EC, each exemption listed in the Annex to that Directive must be subject to a review at least every four years or four years after an item is added to the list with the aim of considering deletion of materials and components of electrical and electronic equipment if their elimination or substitution via design changes or materials and components which do not require any of the materials or substances refered to in Article 4(1) is technically or scientifically possible, provided that the negative environmental, health and/or consumer safety impacts caused by substitution do not outweigh the possible environmental, health and/or consumer safety benefits thereof. Therefore, the review of each exemption provided for in this Decision will be done before 2010.
(6) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Directive 2002/95/EC, the Commission has consulted producers of electrical and electronic equipment, recyclers, treatment operators, environmental organisations and employee and consumers associations and forwarded the comments to the Committee established by Article 18 of Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (3) (the Committee).
(7) The Commission submitted the measures provided for in this Decision for vote in the Committee established under Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC on waste on 19 April 2005. There was no qualified majority in favour of these measures. Thus, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC, a Proposal for a Council Decision was submitted to Council on 6 June 2005.

Determination of the combination BaO + PbO\n\nWeigh, to within 0.0001 grammes, approximately 0.5 grammes of powdered glass and place in a platinum dish. Moisten with water and add 10 millilitres of a 15 % solution of sulphuric acid and 10 millilitres hydrofluoric acid. Heat in sand bath until white fumes are given off. Allow to cool and treat again with 10 millilitres hydrofluoric acid. Heat until reappearance of white fumes. Allow to cool and rinse the sides of the dish with water. Heat until reappearance of white fumes. Allow to cool, carefully add 10 millilitres of water, then transfer to a 400 millilitres beaker. Rinse the dish several times with a 10 % sulphuric and solution and dilute to 100 millilitres with same solution. Boil for 2-3 minutes. Leave to stand overnight.\n\nPass through a filtering crucible of 4 porosity, wash first of all with a 10 % solution of sulphuric acid, then two or three times with ethyl alcohol. Dry for one hour in an oven at 150 ºC. Weigh BaSO4 + PbSO4.\n\n1.1.2. Determination of BaO\n\nWeigh, to within 0.0001 grammes, about 0.5 grammes of powdered glass and place in a platinum dish. Moisten with water and add 10 millilitres of hydrofluoric acid and 5 millilitres perchloric acid. Heat in sand bath until white fumes are given off.\n\nAllow to cool and add a further 10 millilitres hydrofluoric acid. Heat until reappearance of white fumes. Allow to cool and rinse the sides of the dish with distilled water. Heat again and evaporate until almost dry. Start again with 50 millilitres of a 10 % solution of hydrochloric acid and heat gently to aid dissolution. Transfer to a 400 millilitres beaker and dilute to 200 millilitres with water. Bring to boil and pass a current of hydrogen sulphide through the hot solution. When the precipitate of lead sulphide drops to the bottom of the beaker, turn off the hydrogen sulphide. Pass through a fine filter paper and wash with cold water saturated with hydrogen sulphide.\n\nBoil the filtrates and then, if necessary, reduce them by evaporation to 300 millilitres. Add to boiling mixture 10 millilitres of a 10 % solution of sulphuric acid. Remove from heat and leave to stand for at least four hours.\n\nPass through a fine filter paper, wash with cold water. Calcine the precipitate to 1050 ºC, and weigh the BaSO4.\n\n1.2. Determination of ZnO\n\nEvaporate the filtrates from the separation of BaSO4 so as to reduce their volume to 200 millilitres. Neutralise with ammonia in the presence of methyl red and add 20 millilitres of N/10 sulphuric acid. Adjust the pH to 2 (pH meter) by adding N/10 sulphuric acid or N/10 caustic soda whichever the case, and precipitate the zinc sulphide in the cold by passing a current of hydrogen sulphide. Let the precipitate settle for four hours, then collect on a fine filter paper. Wash with cold water saturated with hydrogen sulphide. Dissolve the precipitate on the filter by pouring through it 25 millilitres of a hot 10 % solution of hydrochloric acid. Wash the filter with boiling water until a volume of about 150 millilitres is obtained. Neutralise with ammonia in the presence of litmus paper, then add 1-2 grammes solid urotropine to buffer the solution to about pH 5. Add a few drops of a 0.5 % freshly prepared aqueous solution of xylenol orange and titrate with an N/10 solution of Complexon III until the pink changes to citron yellow.\n\n1.3. Determination of K2O\n\nby precipitation and weighing of potassium tetraphenylborate.\n\nProcedure : 2 grammes of glass are attacked, after crushing and sieving, by\n\n2 millilitres concentrated HNO3\n\n15 millilitres HCO4\n\n25 millilitres HF\n\nin a platinum dish on a water-bath then in a sand bath. After dense fumes of perchloric acid have been given off (continue until dry), dissolve with 20 millilitres of hot water and 2-3 millilitres concentrated HCl.\n\nTransfer to a 200 millilitres graduated flask and adjust to volume with distilled water.\n\nReagents : 6 % solution of sodium tetraphenylborate : dissolve 1.5 grammes of the reagent in 250 millilitres distilled water. Remove the light cloudiness which remains by adding 1 gramme of hydrated aluminia. Shake for five minutes and filter, taking care to re-filter the first 20 millilitres obtained.\n\nWashing solution for the precipitate : prepare a little of the potassium salt by precipitation in a solution of about 0.1 grammes KCl to 50 millilitres N/10 HCl into which the solution of tetraphenylborate is poured while stirring, until precipitation ceases. Filter through a sinter. Wash with distilled water. Dry in a desiccator at room temperature. Then pour 20-30 milligrammes of that salt into 250 millilitres of distilled water. Stir from time to time. After thirty minutes, add 0.5-1 gramme of hydrated alumina. Stir for a few minutes. Filter.\n\nMethod of operation : Take an aliquot of the acid digest corresponding to about 10 milligrammes of K2O. Dilute to about 100 millilitres Slowly add the reagent solution, about 10 millilitres per assumed 5 milligrammes of K2O, while gently stirring. Allow to stand for a maximum of fifteen minutes then filter through a tared sintered crucible of porosity 3 or 4. Wash with washing solution. Dry for thirty minutes at 120 ºC. Conversion factor 0.13143 for K2O.\n\n1.4. Tolerances\n\n± 0.1 in absolute value for each determination. If the analysis gives a lower value, within the tolerances, than the limits fixed (30,24 or 10 %), the average of at least three analyses must be taken. If that average is greater than or equal to 29.95, 23.95 or 9.95 respectively, the glass must be accepted in the category corresponding to 30,24 and 10 % respectively.\n\n2. PHYSICAL DETERMINATIONS     2.1. Density\n\nMethod by hydrostatic balance to within ± 0.01. A sample of at least 20 grammes is weighed in air and weighed immersed in distilled water at 20 ºC.\n\n2.2. Refractive index\n\nThe index is measured on the refractometer to within ± 0.001.\n\n2.3. Microhardness\n\nVickers hardness is to be measured according to the standard ASTM E 92-65 (Revision 1965) but using a load of 50 grammes and taking the average of 15 determinations.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) after confirmation of TSEs in a flock of ovine or caprine animals and sets out a list of rapid tests approved for TSE monitoring.
(2) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 260/2003 (2), since 1 October 2003 certain measures have applied following the confirmed presence of a TSE in ovine or caprine flocks. At the time, two types of TSE potentially present in ovine or caprine animals, namely scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), could not be routinely discriminated in ovine or caprine animals. Strict measures were therefore introduced on the grounds that every TSE case in ovine or caprine animals could be BSE.
(3) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 36/2005 (3), since January 2005 discriminatory testing has been mandatory in all confirmed TSE cases in ovine and caprine animals. Following the stepping-up of surveillance in ovine and caprine animals in 2005 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 214/2005 (4), preliminary results indicate that BSE can be ruled out in all positive TSE cases to date. Measures for the eradication of TSEs in ovine and caprine animals will be reconsidered in the framework of the TSE road map. Discussion on the subject will, however, not be finalised before the end of 2005.
(4) In order to prevent stricter measures to eradicate TSEs in ovine animals becoming applicable despite ongoing discussion on their possible review, transitional measures currently applying until 1 January 2006 on the restocking of flocks culled in connection with TSE eradication should be extended.
(5) In its report of 2 September 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended the approval of a new BSE rapid post-mortem test. That test should be included in the list of rapid tests for monitoring BSE.
(6) Until now, no formal evaluation of tests specifically for the purpose of testing ovine or caprine animals has been completed. Five rapid tests currently listed in Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 were provisionally approved, pending evaluation, for the monitoring programme in ovine and caprine animals on the basis of data provided by the test manufacturers.
(7) In its reports of 17 May and 26 September 2005 on the evaluation of rapid post-mortem tests intended for ovine and caprine animals, the EFSA recommended the approval of eight new rapid post-mortem tests, including the five provisionally approved rapid tests. These tests should be included in the list of rapid tests for monitoring TSEs in ovine and caprine animals.
(8) Changes to rapid tests and to test protocols may only be made with the approval of the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs. The CRL has approved changes to the BSE rapid post-mortem test called ‘Inpro CDI’. The CRL has also accepted the change of name to ‘Beckman Coulter InPro CDI kit’.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Economic operators have not submitted tenders for some of the cereals covered by these tenders for several weeks now, apart from recent bids for small quantities.

(3) In view of this situation and in order to make the quantities of common wheat and barley currently blocked in respect of the standing invitations to tender under Regulation (EC) No 990/2006 available for resale on the internal market, the quantities covered by those invitations to tender should be reduced, in the case of common wheat, by 968 tonnes for the Czech Republic, 199 946 tonnes for Hungary and 91 tonnes for Slovakia, and, in the case of barley, by 342 tonnes for Lithuania, 19 011 tonnes for Hungary and 356 tonnes for Poland.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 99 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Whereas, notwithstanding the achievement of the customs union, which involves the abolition of customs duties and the majority of the charges having equivalent effect in trade between Member States, it is necessary, until harmonisation of indirect taxes has reached an advanced stage, to retain the imposition of tax on importation and the remission of tax on exportation in such trade;
Whereas it is desirable that, even before such harmonisation, the populations of the Member States should become more strongly conscious of the reality of the common market and that to this end measures should be adopted for the greater liberalisation of the system of taxes on imports in travel between Member States ; whereas the need for such measures has been emphasised repeatedly by members of the Assembly;
Whereas reductions of this kind in respect of travel constitute a further step in the direction of the reciprocal opening of the markets of the Member States and the creation of conditions similar to those of a domestic market;
Whereas such reductions must be limited to non-commercial importations of goods by travellers ; whereas, as a general rule, such goods can only be obtained in the country from which they come (country of exit) already taxed, so that if the country of entry forgoes, within the prescribed limits, charging turnover tax and excise duty on imports, this avoids double taxation without leading to an absence of taxation;
Whereas a Community system of tax reductions on imports has proved necessary also in respect of travel between third countries and the Community;","{'title': 'Council Directive 69/169/EEC of 28 May 1969 on the harmonisation of provisions laid down by Law, Regulation or Administrative Action relating to exemption from turnover tax and excise duty on imports in international travel', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 2(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2104/2001(4), provides for the issue by the customs authority at the port of unloading of a certificate attesting the quantity of each product unloaded. However, the Regulation does not lay down the format of that certificate and this has caused a lack of harmonisation. In order to overcome that problem therefore, a model certificate should be included.
(2) In particular, exceptional circumstances, the representative cif prices calculated in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 result in a duty being fixed for lower quality common wheat that is less than that for higher quality common wheat. The lower duty should be applied to the qualities concerned.
(3) Under Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96, where the duty on the quality to be imported is not the highest duty for the product concerned, importers of common and durum wheat must lodge a specific security additional to those required under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(5) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001(6). The purpose of that guarantee is to ensure that the duty applicable to the quality imported is paid. Where the duty applicable to each quality is zero, that guarantee is no longer necessary.
(4) Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 provides for the customs authorities to take representative samples of certain products on import in order to determine the rate of duty applicable on the basis of the quality of the product. Where the import duty is the same for the different qualities of the same product, the taking of samples to achieve the above objective no longer has any point.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 597/2002 of 5 April 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 on rules of application (cereal sector import duties) for Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the common organisation of the market in cereals', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1249/96 is amended as follows:\n\n1.

(1) African swine fever is a highly contagious virus infection of domestic pigs and wild boars, with the potential for very serious and rapid spread, irrespective of national borders.
(2) Since 2007, Russia has been reporting numerous outbreaks of African swine fever in pigs and wild boars throughout the country.
(3) In January 2011 an outbreak of African swine fever was reported close to the Union border, in the region of Saint Petersburg. The presence of that disease close to the Union border constitutes a serious risk to the livestock population in the Union.
(4) The transporter should ensure that for each vehicle used for the transport of animals a register containing information on cleansing and disinfection is retained for a minimum period of 3 years according to Council Directive 64/432/EEC (2).
(5) Import of pigs and pig meat products is not permitted from Russia, however the virus causing the disease persists also in a contaminated environment outside the host animal and can be introduced into the Union with vehicles which have transported pigs.
(6) It is therefore necessary to adopt certain protection measures at Union level taking into account the risk of the spread of the disease, virus survival in the environment and potential routes of its transmission.

Having regard to Council Directive 74/63/EEC of 17 December 1973 on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition (1), as last amended by Directive 96/25/EC (2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas Directive 74/63/EEC provides for regular updating of its Annexes to take account of advances in scientific and technical knowledge;
Whereas, in the light of experience and to improve clarity, the Articles to which the Annexes to Directive 74/63/EEC relate should be listed in the title of the Annexes to Directive 74/63/EEC;
Whereas feed materials containing levels of undesirable substances and products in excess of those indicated for those feed materials in Annex I to Directive 74/63/EEC may only be supplied to compound feed manufacturers approved in accordance with the provisions of Council Directive 95/69/EC of 22 December 1995 laying down the conditions and arrangements for approving and registering certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector (3); whereas those undesirable substances and products, as already announced in Directive 96/25/EC on the circulation of feed materials, where they are not already listed in respect of certain feed materials in Part A of Annex II to Directive 74/63/EEC, should be included in the list in Part B of Annex II to Directive 74/63/EEC opposite the corresponding feed materials;
Whereas Directive 96/25/EC has replaced the terms 'straight feedingstuffs` and 'raw materials` with 'feed materials`, it would seem sensible to adapt the Annexes to this new terminology;
Whereas Directive 74/63/EEC provides for a consolidated version of the Annexes to be adopted at regular intervals in order to incorporate the amendments made on account of advances in scientific and technical knowledge; whereas, since the adoption of the Directive, the Annexes have been amended a number of times; whereas, by reason of their number, complexity and dispersal among numerous Official Journals, the texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation; whereas this opportunity should therefore be taken to consolidate them;

(2) Those prices should be fixed immediately so the customs duties applicable can be determined.
(3) Following the accession of Cyprus to the European Union on 1 May 2004, it is no longer necessary to fix import prices for Cyprus.
(4) Likewise, it is no longer necessary to fix import prices for Israel, Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, in order to take account of the agreements approved by Council Decisions 2003/917/EC of 22 December 2003 on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the State of Israel concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures and the replacement of Protocols 1 and 2 to the EC-Israel Association Agreement (3), 2003/914/EC of 22 December 2003 on the conclusion of an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures and the replacement of Protocols 1 and 3 to the EC-Morocco Association Agreement (4) and 2005/4/EC of 22 December 2004 on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip concerning reciprocal liberalisation measures and the replacement of Protocols 1 and 2 to the EC-Palestinian Authority Interim Association Agreement (5).

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The use of hydrogen peroxide is already subject to restrictions and conditions laid down in Annex III, Part 1 to Directive 76/768/EEC.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products, which has been replaced by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (hereinafter SCCS) pursuant to Commission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 August 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing Decision 2004/210/EC (2), has confirmed that a maximum concentration of 0,1 % of hydrogen peroxide present in oral products or released from other compounds or mixtures in those products is safe. It should therefore be possible to continue to use hydrogen peroxide in that concentration in oral products, including tooth whitening or bleaching products.
(3) The SCCS considers that the use of tooth whitening or bleaching products containing more than 0,1 % and up to 6 % of hydrogen peroxide present or released from other compounds or mixtures in these products may be safe if the following conditions are satisfied: an appropriate clinical examination is carried out in order to ensure there are no risk factors or any other oral pathology of concern and that exposure to these products is limited so as to ensure that the products are used only as intended in terms of frequency and duration of application. These conditions should be fulfilled in order to avoid reasonably foreseeable misuse.
(4) Those products should therefore be regulated in a way that ensures that they are not directly available to the consumer. For each cycle of use of those products, the first use should be limited to dental practitioners, as defined under Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (3) or under their direct supervision if an equivalent level of safety is ensured. Dental practitioners should then provide access to those products for the rest of the cycle of use.
(5) An appropriate labelling regarding the concentration in hydrogen peroxide of the tooth whitening or bleaching products containing more than 0,1 % of this substance should be provided for in order to ensure the appropriate use of these products. For this purpose, the exact concentration in percentage of hydrogen peroxide present or released from other compounds and mixtures in those products should be clearly indicated on the label.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 (3) lays down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.
(2) Those specifications may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(3) On 10 September 2013, an application was submitted for the amendment of specifications concerning the food additive calcium propionate (E 282). The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.
(4) The current specifications for calcium propionate (E 282) set a maximum fluoride level of 10 mg/kg which creates difficulties for the supply of raw materials and the production of that additive. Calcium propionate (E 282) is obtained from calcium oxide (E 529) for which a maximum fluoride level of 50 mg/kg is set. In order to produce calcium propionate complying with the currently established maximum fluoride level, manufacturers need to use calcium oxide with maximum fluoride levels of 33 mg/kg, which is below the currently authorised maximum level. As a consequence, there is hardly any calcium oxide available on the European market for the production of calcium propionate. In order to have a sufficient supply of calcium oxide for the production of calcium propionate the maximum level of fluoride for calcium propionate should be increased from 10 to 20 mg/kg.
(5) The new maximum level of 20 mg/kg remains far below the maximum levels of fluoride currently in place for other food additives. The additional exposure to fluoride based on the new maximum level should remain limited and should not lead to an increase in the overall intake. It is therefore appropriate to allow the amendment of the specifications concerning the food additive calcium propionate (E 282).
(6) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the update concerned is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas environment statistics form part of the framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information 1993-97 adopted by the Council in Decision 93/464/EEC (5); whereas Article 4 of that Decision foresees the need for further  specific implementing actions to be decided by the Council; whereas the present development programme for environment statistics is such an action;
Whereas there is a clear need for integrated quantitative information on the relationship between the environment on the one hand and the socio-economic activities and policies on the other hand;
Whereas it is essential for developments in official environmental statistics to be coordinated in order to contribute to meeting the main international, Community and national needs at minimum public and private cost, and that this can most  conveniently be done within the established procedures of cooperation between the Commission, the statistical services of international organizations and those of the Member States; whereas it is therefore appropriate to adopt a four-year programme to  ensure this coordinated development;

Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory  Committee,
Whereas:
A.  Background
(1)  In September 1994, following a review, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No  2271/94  (2), amended the definitive countervailing duty imposed on imports of ball bearings with a  greatest external diameter not exceeding 30 mm, originating in Thailand but exported to the  Community from another country, from 6,7  % to 5,3  %.
(2)  The 6,7  % countervailing duty had been imposed in July 1993 by Regulation (EEC) No 1781/93   (3), following a review of Commission Decision 90/266/EEC  (4), accepting an undertaking offered by  the Royal Thai Government, in connection with the countervailing duty proceeding concerning imports  of the abovementioned ball bearings. This involved the Royal Thai Government levying an export tax  to offset the subsidies granted. No countervailing duty was imposed at the time of adoption of this  Decision. The review investigation revealed, however, that a duty was necessary in order to prevent  indirect imports into the Community avoiding the export tax levied by the Royal Thai Government on  direct imports and to safeguard the effectiveness of the undertaking.
(3)  The amended definitive duty rate of 5,3  % on indirect imports, posed by Regulation (EC) No  2271/94, was based on the revised rate of export tax of 0,72 baht per piece, as determined by  Decision 94/639/EC  (5), following a further review.
B.  Reopening of investigation
(4)  In December 1994, the Commission initiated a review of  Decision 94/639/EC and of Regulation (EC) No 2271/94, by a notice published in the Official Journal  of the European Communities (6).
(5)  The purpose of this review was to recalculate the amount of subsidy granted by the Royal Thai  Government, with a view to allowing a modification of the rate of export tax established by  Decision 94/639/EC. Since the rate of countervailing duty on indirect imports directly reflects the  export tax rate, the review also covers Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 imposing the definitive duty.
(6)  The Commission officially advised the Royal Thai Government, the exporters and importers known  to be concerned, as well as the complainant in the original investigation (Febma) and gave the  parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and request a  hearing. The Royal Thai Government, the exporters located in Thailand and the Community producers,  represented by Febma, made their views known in writing.
(7)  The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes  of a determination and carried out an investigation at the premises of the following:
(a)  Royal Thai Government:
Department of Foreign Trade, Bangkok,
Board of Investment, Bangkok;
(b)  Thai exporters:
NMB Thai Ltd, Ayutthaya, Thailand,
Pelmec Thai Ltd, Bang Pa-In, Thailand,
NMB Hi-Tech Ltd, Bang Pa-In, Thailand.
All these exporting companies are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mineba Co., Ltd., Japan.
(8)  Upon request, parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of  which it was intended to recommend the amendment to the rate of definitive countervailing duty.  They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.
The written comments submitted by the parties were, where appropriate, taken into consideration.
C.  Recalculation of subsidy amount
(9)  It has been determined that the countervailable  subsidies granted to the exporters in Thailand in the period 1 October 1993 to 31 March 1994 ('the  investigation period`) amount to 0,66 baht per piece. The Royal Thai Government has accordingly  amended the export tax rate on ball bearings exported directly to the Community to 0,66 baht per  piece, and has offered a modified version of the undertaking to this effect. Ths has been accepted  by Commission Decision 95/180/EC  (1), which also explains in detail the reasoning with regard to  the calculation of the amount of subsidy.
D.  Injury and Community interest
(10)  No new evidence was supplied with regard to injury or  Community interest. The Council therefore maintains its conclusions set out in Regulation (EC) No  2271/94 concerning these matters.
E.  Amendments to definitive duty
(11)  In view of the change in the export tax rate from 0,72 to  0,66 baht per piece, the rate of definitive countervailing duty on indirect imports should be  amended accordingly to an amount equivalent to the new export tax rate. When expressed as a  percentage of the net, free-at-Community-frontier, price of the product, the new rate of  countervailing duty amounts to 4,8  %.
F.  Collection of anti-dumping and countervailing duties
(12)  As explained in recital (12) of  Regulation (EC) No 2271/94, the countervailing duty should continue to be collected in addition to  the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2934/90  (2).
The combined amount of anti-dumping and countervailing duty to be collected in this case is,  therefore, 11,5  % (6,7  % anti-dumping duty plus 4,8  % countervailing duty).
The basis for calculating the amount of both anti-dumping and countervailing duty should be the  same net, free-at-Community-frontier, price of the product,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1169/95 of 22 May 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of ball bearings with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 30 mm, originating in Thailand but exported to the Community from another country', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 shall be replaced by the  following:', 'text': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2271/94 shall be replaced by the  following:\n\n\'Article 1  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1781/93 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n""2.

Whereas, however, both on the Community market and for imports, prices for both types of nectarine run parallel at different levels to those for peaches; whereas, moreover, quotations for nectarines are not regularly recorded on these markets; whereas  there is no need, therefore, to take producer prices for nectarines into consideration for the application of Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;
Whereas peaches harvested during a given crop year are marketed from May to October; whereas the quantities harvested in May, during the first 10 days of June and in October are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these periods;  whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 11 June to 30 September inclusive;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;
Whereas Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3820/92 of 28 December 1992 on transitional measures for the application of the agrimonetary arrangements laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 (6) establishes a correspondence between the  provisions of the agrimonetary arrangements applicable from 1 January 1993 and those applicable before that date;

accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of urea originating in Austria, Hungary, Malaysia or Romania, confirming the undertakings accepted pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3339/87 and terminating the investigations
(89/143/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1) and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
I. CURRENT PROCEEDING
A. Provisional measures
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88 imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of urea originating in Austria, Hungary, Malaysia, Romania, the USA or Venezuela (2). That duty was extended for a period not exceeding two months by Council Regulation (EEC) No 4018/88 (3).
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Community producers and several exporters of the product concerned asked for and obtained a hearing and also made known in writing their views on the Regulation imposing the provisional duty.
(3) In addition to the investigations which resulted in the determination of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Commission carried out further investigations at the premises of the following Community producers:
Belgium
Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij BV (NSM), Brussels,
France
- Compagnie française de l'azote (Cofaz), Paris,
- Société Chimique de la Grande Paroisse, Paris,
Ireland
Irish Fertilizer Industries (IFI), Dublin.
C. Dumping
(a) Normal value
1. Austria
(4) Normal value was definitively calculated according to the method used for the provisional calculation of normal value, in other words on the basis of the prices charged during the reference period on the domestic market by the Austrian exporter, which provided sufficient evidence. The Austrian exporter expressed no objection to the method laid down in recital 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88 or the results obtained by the Commission.
2. Malaysia
(5) Normal value was definitively calculated on the basis of constructed value, since the average selling price on the Malaysian domestic market during the reference period was lower than the cost of production. Normal value was definitively established according to the method, and in accordance with the information, given in recitals 11, 12 and 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88.
In this connection, the Malaysian firms concerned by the current proceeding reiterated for the most part the arguments they had put forward prior to adoption of the Regulation. In these circumstances, and in the absence of fresh evidence, the Commission confirms the validity of the method referred to above.
3. Hungary and Romania
(6) As Hungary and Romania are State-trading countries, normal value was definitively calculated according to the method used for the provisional calculation, that is on the basis of prices charged on the Austrian domestic market and according to the method, and in accordance with the information, given in recitals 18 to 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88.
(7) The Hungarian exporter contested the choice of Austria as an analogous country, maintaining that Austria was not representative because the Austrian exporter had a monopoly position and its production costs were greater than the Hungarian production costs.
Although no evidence was offered in support of these arguments, the Commission noted that prices on the Austrian market were influenced by a considerable level of imports, and that in this sense they were representative. As regards costs, the Commission received not the slightest evidence that some costs in Hungary were lower than costs found in Austria. In any case, even if it were possible to establish exactly the existence and extent of the advantages and disadvantages in question, any adjustment on this basis of costs determined in a market economy country would imply taking as a basis for comparison costs in a non-market economy country, which is precisely what Article 2 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 aims to prevent.
In these circumstances the Commission confirms the choice of Austria as an analogous country for the establishment of normal value in Hungary.
(8) The Romanian exporter repeated its objections to the choice of Austria as an analogous country, on the grounds that the Austrian market was very narrow and therefore not representative, that it was largely made up of urea for technological use whereas Romania exports only agricultural urea, and that Austria has no natural gas; Romania therefore proposed Kuwait as a reference country.
The Commission confirms its position, set out in recital 21 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88, as follows:
- although the Austrian market is limited, it is a competitive market where prices are influenced by substantial imports and are representative in this sense;
- the argument based on the type of urea is not relevant, since there are no significant differences in the technology and processes involved in the production of urea;
- any possible advantage resulting from the cost of gas was difficult to quantify and might be counterbalanced by other competitive disadvantages, as explained in recital 20 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88.
In these circumstances, the Commission considers it appropriate and not unreasonable to base normal value in Romania on prices on the Austrian domestic market. It is not therefore appropriate to choose Kuwait as reference country.
(b) Export prices
(9) Export prices were definitively determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for products sold for export to the Community.
(c) Comparison
(10) In general, normal value was compared transaction by transaction with export prices at ex-works level.
The adjustments provisionally made, where appropriate, in recital 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88 to take account of differences affecting price comparability were retained.
(d) Dumping margins
(11) The dumping margin calculated for each exporter is equal to the difference between the normal value as established and the price for each export transaction to the Community, duly adjusted.
On the basis of the free-at-frontier price, the weighted average dumping margin for each of the exporters concerned is as follows:
1.2 // - Austria: Chemie Linz   // over 50,0 %,   // - Hungary: Chemolimpex   // over 51,0 %,   // - Malaysia: ABF/Petronas   // 41,0 %,   // - Romania: ICE Chimica   // over 55,0 %.
D. Injury
(12) As no new evidence was received, the Commission confirms the facts and conclusions presented in recitals 27, 30, 32 and 36 to 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88.
As regards the effect of dumped imports on the market share held by the exporters, on Community production and on the sales and market share of Community producers, as determined following the additional investigations carried out after the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Commission refers to the amended information contained in recitals 14, 17, 19 and 20 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 450/89 (1) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of urea originating in the United States of America or Venezuela.
E. Quantitative restrictions and anti-dumping measures
(13) As regards the existence in certain Member States of the Community of quantitative restrictions concerning imports of urea originating in Hungary or Romania, it was argued by the Romanian exporter that the imposition of an anti-dumping duty on imports of urea in addition to the quantitative restrictions was incompatible with some provisions of the GATT. The Commission considers that neither Community law nor international rules forbid the imposition of import duties, customs duties or any other measure affecting imports, provided that injury has been established.
As for the advisability of such measures in this case, the Commission notes that during the reference period more than half of the exports were concentrated on the markets of the Member States not protected by quantitative restrictions, namely Belgium, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom. In additon, it was established that the quantitative restrictiodns on imports of the products concerned into Germany and Ireland had been substantially exceeded.
The Commission also notes that there is substantial price undercutting on these imports, reaching 17 % in the case of Hungary and 38 % in that of Romania.
As a result, the quantitative restrictions existing in certain Member States do not eliminate the injury caused to the majority of the Community by the unfair trading practices of the Hungarian and Romanian exporters.
F. Community interest
(14) As regards the Community's interest in taking protective measures against dumped imports, Malaysia repeated the arguments put forward in recital 42 of Regulation (EEC) No 2623/88.
G. Undertakings
(15) The following producers/exporters offered undertakings in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88:
1.2 // - Austria:   // Chemie Linz GmbH,   // - Hungary:  // Chemolimpex,   // - Malaysia:   // Asean Rintulu Fertilizer,   //   // SDN. BHD (ABF)/Petroliam,   //  // National Berhard (Petronas),   // Romania:   // ICE Chimica.
The Commission regarded these undertakings as acceptable, considering that they were such as to bring some stability to the Community market while allowing the exporters in question to maintain a share of the Community market.
H. Collection of the provisional duty
(16) Given the dumping margins established and the injury caused, the Commission considers it necessary to release the amounts secured by way of a provisional duty, for the following reasons:
- in the case of products originating in Malaysia, malaysia qualifies for special differential treatment under Article 13 of the GATT anti-dumping code;
- in the case of products originating in Austria, the provisional anti-dumping duty is very small;
- in the case of products originating in Hungary and Romania, there were no exports of the product in question between the imposition of the provisional duty and the Commission Decision.
II. REVIEW OF PREVIOUS MEASURES
(17) Having reviewed the measures as requested by the Council, the Commission found that the undertakings accepted pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3339/87 (2) had been adhered to and that they were such as to have alleviated considerably the difficulties facing the Communmity industry by reducing imports of urea originating in the countries concerned to a reasonable share of Community consumption.
In these circumstances, the Commission confirms the validity of the undertakings accepted pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 3339/87.
III. TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION
(18) The exporters concerned were informed of the main conclusions of the investigation and had the opportunity to make known their point of view.
In consultations within the Advisory Committee, certain Member States opposed the proposed undertakings.
The Commission presented the proposal for acceptance of undertakings to the Council. There was not the necessary qualified majority in the Council to accept the undertakings as proposed. Since it was also impossible to find a qualified majority for the Council to take a different decision, the undertakings offered by the exporters can be accepted under Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, and the investigations concerning imports of urea originating in the countries involved in the proceeding can be terminated pursuantto Article 9 of the same Regulation,","{'title': 'Commission Decision of 21 February 1989 accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of urea originating in Austria, Hungary, Malaysia or Romania, confirming the undertakings accepted pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3339/87 and terminating the investigations', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) and Article 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation) to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil.
(2) The request has been lodged on 12 August 2002 by the Defence Committee of Malleable Cast Iron pipe Fittings Industry of the European Union on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings.
B. PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention is threaded malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings, currently classifiable within CN code ex 7307 19 10. This code is given for information only.
C. EXISTING MEASURES
(4) The measures currently in force and allegedly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2000(3).
D. GROUNDS
(5) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence, that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Argentina of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings.
(6) The evidence submitted is as follows:
(a) the request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from Brazil and Argentina to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned and for which there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty.
This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from a transhipment of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil via Argentina;
(b) furthermore, the request contains sufficient evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in Brazil are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings consigned from Argentina appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned from Brazil. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increase in imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures;
(c) finally, the request contains sufficient evidence that the prices of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings are dumped in relation to the normal values previously established for the certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings originating in Brazil.
E. PROCEDURE
(7) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports consigned from Argentina, whether declared as originating in Argentina or not, of certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(i) Questionnaires
(8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Argentina, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Brazil and to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that lead to the existing measures, and to the authorities of Brazil and Argentina. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(9) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and if not, to request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(10) The authorities of Brazil and Argentina will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(ii) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(11) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(iii) Exemption of registration of imports or measures
(12) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(13) Given that the alleged circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemption of imports from registration or measures would depend entirely on the findings in respect of the exporters in Argentina. Therefore exporters wishing to obtain an exemption of registration of imports or measures should apply for the exemption and submit the questionnaire reply (in order to establish that they are not circumventing the anti-dumping duties within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation) within the time limits set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation. Although no exemption could be granted purely on the basis of information from importers, these could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from exporters which are granted such an exemption.
F. REGISTRATION
(14) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this investigation on certain malleable cast iron tube or pipe fittings consigned from Argentina.

","Directive 2004/36/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 21 April 2004
on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 26 February 2004,
Whereas:
(1) The Resolution on the air disaster off the coast of the Dominican Republic adopted by the European Parliament on 15 February 1996(4) highlights the need for the Community to take a more active stance and develop a strategy to improve the safety of its citizens travelling by air or living near airports.
(2) The Commission has issued a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ""Defining a Community Aviation Safety Improvement Strategy"".
(3) That Communication clearly states that safety may be effectively enhanced by ensuring that aircraft comply fully with the international safety standards contained in the Annexes to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 (""the Chicago Convention"").
(4) In order to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe, a harmonised approach to the effective enforcement of international safety standards within the Community should be introduced. To that end, it is necessary to harmonise the rules and procedures for ramp inspections of third-country aircraft landing at airports located in the Member States.
(5) A harmonised approach to the effective enforcement of international safety standards by the Member States will avoid distortions of competition. A common stance on third-country aircraft that fail to comply with international safety standards will be of benefit to the position of the Member States.
(6) Aircraft landing in the Member States should undergo an inspection when it is suspected that they do not comply with international safety standards.
(7) Inspections may also be carried out in accordance with a spot-check procedure in the absence of any particular suspicion, provided that Community and international law is observed. In particular, the inspections should be carried out in a non-discriminatory way.
(8) Inspections could be stepped up in the case of aircraft in which defects have already been identified frequently in the past, or on aircraft belonging to airlines whose aircraft have frequently attracted attention.
(9) Information gathered in each Member State should be made available to all the other Member States and the Commission in order to ensure the most efficient monitoring of the compliance of third country aircraft with international safety standards.
(10) For these reasons there is a need to establish, at Community level, a procedure for the assessment of third-country aircraft and related cooperation mechanisms between the competent authorities of the Member States to exchange information.
(11) The sensitive nature of safety-related information requires that Member States should take necessary measures, in accordance with their national law, to ensure appropriate confidentiality of the information received by them.
(12) Without prejudice to the public's right of access to the Commission's documents as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents(5), the Commission should adopt measures for the dissemination to interested parties of such information and the associated conditions.
(13) Aircraft on which corrective measures are required should, where the identified deficiencies are clearly hazardous to safety, be grounded until the non-compliance with international safety standards has been rectified.
(14) The facilities in the airport of inspection may be such that the competent authority will be obliged to authorise the aircraft to transfer to an appropriate airport, provided that conditions for a safe transfer are complied with.
(15) In order to carry out its tasks under this Directive, the Commission should be assisted by the committee instituted by Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation(6).
(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(7).
(17) The Commission should place at the disposal of the committee instituted by Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 statistics and information collected in compliance with other Community measures concerning specific incidents that could be relevant to uncovering deficiencies representing a threat to civil aviation safety.
(18) It is necessary to take into account the cooperation and information exchanges occurring within the framework of the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) and the European Civil Aviation Conference (ECAC). Moreover, the greatest possible use should be made of existing expertise in procedures of Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft (SAFA).
(19) Account should be taken of the role of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in civil aviation safety policy, including the establishment of procedures that aim to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe.

","COUNCIL DECISION of 30 March 1998 on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the accession partnership with the Republic of Lithuania (98/265/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 of 16 March 1998 on assistance to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy, and in particular on the establishment of accession partnerships (1), and in particular to Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Luxembourg European Council stated that the accession partnership is a new instrument, the key feature of the enhanced pre-accession strategy;
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 622/98 sets out that the Council shall decide, by a qualified majority and following a proposal from the Commission, on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the individual accession partnerships, as they are submitted to each applicant country, as well as on subsequent significant adjustments applicable to them;
Whereas Community assistance is conditional on the fulfilment of essential elements, and in particular on the respect of the commitments contained in the Europe Agreements and on progress towards fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria; whereas, where an essential element is lacking, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may take appropriate steps with regard to any pre-accession assistance;
Whereas the Luxembourg European Council decided that the implementation of the accession partnership and progress in adopting the acquis will be examined in the Europe Agreement bodies;
Whereas the Commission's opinion presented an objective analysis on the Republic of Lithuania's preparations for membership and identified a number of priority areas for further work;
Whereas, in order to prepare for membership, the Republic of Lithuania should draw up a national programme for the adoption of the acquis; whereas this programme should set out a timetable for achieving the priorities and intermediate objectives established in the accession partnership,","{'title': '98/265/EC: Council Decision of 30 March 1998 on the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the accession partnership with the Republic of Lithuania', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98, the principles, priorities, intermediate objectives and conditions contained in the accession partnership for the Republic of Lithuania are set out in the Annex hereto, which forms an integral part of this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe implementation of the accession partnership will be examined in the Europe Agreement bodies and through the appropriate Council bodies to which the Commission will report regularly.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 March 1998.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nM. BECKETT\n\n(1) OJ L 85, 20.3.1998, p. 1.\n\nANNEX\n\nLITHUANIA\n\n1. Objectives\n\nThe purpose of the accession partnership is to set out in a single framework the priority areas for further work identified in the Commission's opinion on Lithuania's application for membership of the European Union, the financial means available to help Lithuania implement these priorities and the conditions which will apply to that assistance. The accession partnership will provide a framework for a number of policy instruments which will be used to help the candidate countries in their preparations for membership. These will include inter alia the national programme for the adoption of the acquis to be adopted by Lithuania, the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, the Pact against organised crime and the internal market road maps. Each of these instruments is different in nature and will be prepared and implemented according to specific procedures. They will not be an integral part of this partnership but the priorities they contain will be compatible with it.\n\n2. Principles\n\nThe main priority areas identified for each candidate country relate to their ability to assume the obligations of meeting the Copenhagen criteria which state that membership requires:\n\n- that the candidate country has achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities,\n\n- the existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union,\n\n- the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.\n\nAt its meeting in Madrid, the European Council stressed the need for the candidate countries to adjust their administrative structures to ensure the harmonious operation of Community policies after accession and at Luxembourg, it stressed that incorporation of the acquis into legislation is necessary, but not in itself sufficient; it is necessary to ensure that it is actually applied.\n\n3. Priorities and intermediate objectives\n\nThe Commission's opinions and the Council's examination of these have highlighted the extent of the efforts which still have to be made in certain areas by the candidate countries to prepare for accession and took the view that none of these countries fully satisfies all of the Copenhagen criteria at the present time. This situation will require the definition of intermediate stages in terms of priorities, each to be accompanied by precise objectives to be set in collaboration with the countries concerned, the achievement of which will condition the degree of assistance granted and the progress of the negotiations under way with some countries and the opening of new negotiations with the others. The priorities and intermediate objectives have been divided into two groups - short and medium-term. Those listed under the short term have been selected on the basis that it is realistic to expect that Lithuania can complete or take them substantially forward by the end of 1998. In view of the short time span, and taking into account the administrative capacity required to achieve them, the number of priorities selected for the short term has been limited. The priorities listed under the medium term are expected to take more than one year to complete although work may and should also begin on them during 1998.\n\nLithuania will be invited to draw up a national programme for the adoption of the acquis (NPAA) by the end of March which should set out a timetable for achieving these priorities and intermediate objectives and, where possible and relevant, indicate the necessary staff and financial resources.\n\nThe accession partnership will indicate that Lithuania will have to address all issues identified in the opinion. Incorporation of the acquis into legislation is not in itself sufficient; it will also be necessary to ensure that it is actually applied to the same standards as those which apply within the Union. In all of the areas listed below there is a need for credible and effective implementation and enforcement of the acquis.\n\nDrawing on the analysis of the Commission's opinion and the Council's examination of this, the following short- and medium-term priorities and intermediate objectives have been identified for Lithuania.\n\n3.1. Short-term (1998)\n\nEconomic reform: establishment of medium-term economic policy priorities and joint assessment within the framework of the Europe Agreement; acceleration of large-scale privatisation and progress towards the restructuring of the banking, energy and agri-food sectors, enforcement of financial discipline for enterprises.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: in particular major efforts on public administration reform, border control, customs, taxation and finance, as well as preparation of training strategy for civil servants and the judiciary, veterinary and phytosanitary administrations, particularly as regards facilities at the external borders, institutional strengthening in the area of environment, begin to set up structures needed for regional and structural policy.\n\nInternal market: including further alignment in the areas of intellectual and industrial property, public procurement, financial services, phytosanitary and veterinary administration, and upgrading of independent standardisation and conformity assessment structures. Adoption of new competition law and establishment of transparent State aid inventory.\n\nJustice and home affairs: in particular further efforts to implement measures to combat corruption and organised crime and improve border management in facilities for refugee reception.\n\nEnvironment: continue transposition of framework legislation, establishment and commencement of implementation of detailed approximation programmes and implementation strategies related to individual acts. Planning and commencement of implementation of these programmes and strategies.\n\nEnergy: in particular establishing a comprehensive, long-term, energy strategy and decommissioning plan for the nuclear power plant Ignalina according to commitments entered into in the Nuclear Safety Account Agreement.\n\n3.2. Medium term\n\nEconomic reform: consolidate the privatisation process and restructuring of the banking, energy and agri-food sectors and align legal framework (bankruptcy and competition legislation, simplification of business regulations including licensing).\n\nEconomic policy: regular review of the joint assessment of economic policy priorities, within the Europe Agreement framework, focusing on satisfying the Copenhagen criteria for membership of the Union and the acquis in the area of economic and monetary policy (coordination of economic policies, submission of convergence programmes, avoidance of excessive deficits); while Lithuania is not expected to adopt the euro immediately on accession, it is expected to pursue policies which aim to achieve real convergence in accordance with the Union's objectives of economic and social cohesion, and nominal convergence compatible with the ultimate goal of adoption of the euro.\n\nReinforcement of institutional and administrative capacity: development of anti-fraud unit and State audit office and of budget and financial control mechanisms; improved operation of the judicial system; training for the judiciary in Community law and its application; reinforcement of justice and home affairs institutions (ensuring sufficient and properly trained personnel, in particular police, border guards, ministries and courts), strengthening of the nuclear safety authority, reform of customs and tax administrations to ensure readiness to apply the acquis, the reinforcement of food control administration.\n\nInternal market: including alignment of capital liberalisation, public procurement legislation, audiovisual policies, indirect taxation and statistics, further alignment and effective enforcement of competition law, in particular State aid control; reinforcement of competition authorities, upgrading of standardisation and conformity assessment structures, establishment of a market surveillance system and alignment of horizontal technical legislation on industrial products, promotion of enterprise development, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), alignment with the acquis in the fields of telecommunications, consumer protection and the internal energy market.\n\nJustice and home affairs: development of effective border management, fight against organised crime (in particular money laundering, drugs and trafficking in human beings) and corruption, alignment of visa policy with that of the Union and completion of alignment on international conventions, implementation of migration policy and asylum procedures notably in view of the Schengen acquis.\n\nAgriculture: including alignment with the agricultural acquis (including veterinary and phytosanitary matters, in particular external border controls), attention to environmental aspects of agriculture and biodiversity, completion of land registration and establishment of a functioning land market. Development of the capacity to implement and enforce the common agricultural policy (CAP), in particular the fundamental management mechanisms and administrative structures to monitor the agricultural markets and implement structural and rural development measures, adoption and implementation of the veterinary and phytosanitary requirements, upgrading of certain food-processing establishments and testing and diagnostic facilities, restructuring of the agri-food sector.\n\nFisheries: development of capacity to implement and enforce the common fisheries policy.\n\nEnergy: implementation of a comprehensive energy strategy based on efficiency and diversification, including respect of nuclear safety standards and realistic nuclear power plant closure commitments (NSA).\n\nTransport: further efforts on alignment with the acquis, in particular on maritime (safety) and road and rail transport, and to provide necessary investment for transport infrastructure, notably extension of trans-European networks.\n\nEmployment and social affairs: development of appropriate labour-market structures and joint review of employment policies as preparation for participation in Union coordination of employment policies, alignment of labour and occupational health and safety legislation, in particular early adoption of the framework directive on health and safety at work; further development of an active social dialogue; further development of social protection; enforcement of equal opportunities between women and men, undertake steps to bring public health standards into line with Union norms.\n\nEnvironment: including the development of monitoring and implementation control structures and capacities, continuous planning and implementation of approximation programmes related to individual legal acts. A particular emphasis should be given to air pollution, drinking water and the waste sector as well as nuclear safety. Environmental protection requirements and the need for sustainable development must be integrated into the definition and implementation of national, sectoral policies.\n\nRegional policy and cohesion: introduce the legal administrative and budgetary framework for a national policy to address regional disparities through an integrated approach, in order to participate in Union structural programmes after membership.\n\n4. Programming\n\nThe PHARE allocation for the period 1995 to 1997 has totalled ECU 145 million. Subject to the approval of the PHARE budget for the remaining period, the Commission will confirm the allocations for 1998 and 1999. In addition Lithuania is eligible for support from the catch-up facility envisaged for 1998. Financial proposals will be submitted to the PHARE Management Committee as provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89. Joint financing by the applicant countries will be systematically required for all investment projects. Financial assistance from the year 2000 onwards will comprise aid for agriculture and a structural instrument which will give priority to measures similar to the Cohesion Fund.\n\n5. Conditionality\n\nCommunity assistance will be conditional on respect by Lithuania of its commitments under the Europe Agreement, further steps towards satisfying the Copenhagen criteria and progress in implementing this accession partnership. Failure to respect these general conditions could lead to a decision by the Council on the suspension of financial assistance on the basis of Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98.\n\n6. Monitoring\n\nThe implementation of the accession partnership will be monitored in the framework of the Europe Agreement. This will begin in 1998 before the Commission presents its first regular report to the Council reviewing the progress made by Lithuania including implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe relevant sections of the accession partnership will be discussed in the appropriate sub-committee. The Association Committee will discuss overall developments, progress and problems in meeting its priorities and intermediate objectives as well as more specific issues referred to it from the sub-committees. The Association Committee will report to the Association Council on the implementation of the accession partnership.\n\nThe PHARE Management Committee will ensure that financing decisions are compatible with the accession partnerships.\n\nThe accession partnership will be amended as necessary in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 622/98. The Commission will propose, before the end of 1999 and at regular intervals thereafter, a review of this partnership, on which the Council will take a formal decision. These reviews will include consideration of the need to further specify intermediate objectives in the light of the progress made by Lithuania in meeting the objectives set out in this partnership.""}]}"

(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(2), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(3), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) With a view to enlargement on 1 May 2004 and to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the new Member States on the Community level, all remaining refunds for exports to the new Member States should be abolished.
(10) The consolidation of the maximum quantities for export within the limits set in the WTO Agreement will be more binding on the accession of the new Member States. In order to ensure the satisfactory management and optimum use of the maximum quantities for export, steps should therefore be taken to reduce or abolish the refunds for certain destinations, in particular those located in or close to the geographical area of the Community where the level of prices for milk products no longer justify the present level of refund rates, despite the collection of import duty in some of those countries.
(11) The policy of some non-member countries is to prevent disturbance on the internal market by applying frontier measures. The refunds for certain milk products exported to those destinations should be differentiated in order to reduce the risk of such measures being applied.
(12) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

derogating from Article 31(10) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards proof of arrival at destination in the case of differentiated refunds and laying down detailed rules for the application of the lowest export refund rate for certain milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular the third indent of Article 31(10) and Article 31(14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The third indent of Article 31(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 stipulates that in the case of differentiated refunds the refund is to be paid on presentation of proof that the products have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund was fixed. Exceptions to that rule are possible provided that conditions are laid down offering equivalent guarantees.
(2) In the event that export refunds are differentiated according to destination, Article 18(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1253/2002(4), stipulates that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest rate for the refund, is to be paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(3) Under special arrangements with certain third countries, the refund rate applicable to the export of certain milk products to those countries may be lower, in some cases by a large amount, than the refund normally applied. It is also possible that a refund may not be fixed so the lowest rate of the refund is also the result of the lack of fixing of a refund.
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1151/2002 of 27 June 2002 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Estonia(5) establishes concessions in the form of reciprocal tariff quotas involving the abolition of Community refunds on certain milk products. Similar concessions have been agreed with Latvia and Lithuania. Refunds for the products concerned from the three Baltic states have therefore been abolished with effect from 4 July 2002.
(5) The abolition of refunds entails a differentiation of refunds for certain milk products. So as to avoid requiring exporters to furnish proof of arrival at destination in order to qualify for a refund in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, the authorities of the countries to whom concessions have been granted have undertaken to ensure that only consignments of Community products which have not received refunds will be accepted for import into those countries. To that end, the provisions applicable to Poland by virtue of Article 20(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1368/2002(7), have been extended to the countries and products concerned. A derogation should therefore be made from Article 31(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(6) Article 20(b) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 obliges operators to present a certified copy of the export licence and the corresponding export declaration to the competent authorities when the products referred to in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 are imported to the destinations referred to in that Annex. The export licence must bear special indications guaranteeing that the products concerned have not received an export refund. The authorities of the third countries concerned are to verify compliance with the provisions of Article 20b of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999.
(7) Account should be taken of these special arrangements when applying Regulations (EC) No 1255/1999 and (EC) No 800/1999 so as to avoid imposing on exporters unnecessary financial charges during their trade with third countries. To that end, when the lowest refund rate is determined the rates fixed on the conditions and for the particular destination concerned should not be taken into account.
(8) For the sake of clarity, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2886/2000 of 27 December 2000 derogating from Article 31(10) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards proof of arrival at destination in the case of differentiated refunds and laying down detailed rules for the application of the lowest export refund rate for certain milk products(8), which lays down similar provisions for the export of certain products to Poland, should be repealed. The provisions of that Regulation should be incorporated into this Regulation.

","Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 27 January 2003
on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 8 November 2002(4),
Whereas:
(1) The disparities between the laws or administrative measures adopted by the Member States as regards the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment could create barriers to trade and distort competition in the Community and may thereby have a direct impact on the establishment and functioning of the internal market. It therefore appears necessary to approximate the laws of the Member States in this field and to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment.
(2) The European Council at its meeting in Nice on 7, 8 and 9 December 2000 endorsed the Council Resolution of 4 December 2000 on the precautionary principle.
(3) The Commission Communication of 30 July 1996 on the review of the Community strategy for waste management stresses the need to reduce the content of hazardous substances in waste and points out the potential benefits of Community-wide rules limiting the presence of such substances in products and in production processes.
(4) The Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 on a Community action programme to combat environmental pollution by cadmium(5) invites the Commission to pursue without delay the development of specific measures for such a programme. Human health also has to be protected and an overall strategy that in particular restricts the use of cadmium and stimulates research into substitutes should therefore be implemented. The Resolution stresses that the use of cadmium should be limited to cases where suitable and safer alternatives do not exist.
(5) The available evidence indicates that measures on the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as set out in Directive 2002/96/EC of 27 January 2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council on waste electrical and electronic equipment(6) are necessary to reduce the waste management problems linked to the heavy metals concerned and the flame retardants concerned. In spite of those measures, however, significant parts of WEEE will continue to be found in the current disposal routes. Even if WEEE were collected separately and submitted to recycling processes, its content of mercury, cadmium, lead, chromium VI, PBB and PBDE would be likely to pose risks to health or the environment.
(6) Taking into account technical and economic feasibility, the most effective way of ensuring the significant reduction of risks to health and the environment relating to those substances which can achieve the chosen level of protection in the Community is the substitution of those substances in electrical and electronic equipment by safe or safer materials. Restricting the use of these hazardous substances is likely to enhance the possibilities and economic profitability of recycling of WEEE and decrease the negative health impact on workers in recycling plants.
(7) The substances covered by this Directive are scientifically well researched and evaluated and have been subject to different measures both at Community and at national level.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive take into account existing international guidelines and recommendations and are based on an assessment of available scientific and technical information. The measures are necessary to achieve the chosen level of protection of human and animal health and the environment, having regard to the risks which the absence of measures would be likely to create in the Community. The measures should be kept under review and, if necessary, adjusted to take account of available technical and scientific information.
(9) This Directive should apply without prejudice to Community legislation on safety and health requirements and specific Community waste management legislation, in particular Council Directive 91/157/EEC of 18 March 1991 on batteries and accumulators containing certain dangerous substances(7).
(10) The technical development of electrical and electronic equipment without heavy metals, PBDE and PBB should be taken into account. As soon as scientific evidence is available and taking into account the precautionary principle, the prohibition of other hazardous substances and their substitution by more environmentally friendly alternatives which ensure at least the same level of protection of consumers should be examined.
(11) Exemptions from the substitution requirement should be permitted if substitution is not possible from the scientific and technical point of view or if the negative environmental or health impacts caused by substitution are likely to outweigh the human and environmental benefits of the substitution. Substitution of the hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment should also be carried out in a way so as to be compatible with the health and safety of users of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE).
(12) As product reuse, refurbishment and extension of lifetime are beneficial, spare parts need to be available.
(13) The adaptation to scientific and technical progress of the exemptions from the requirements concerning phasing out and prohibition of hazardous substances should be effected by the Commission under a committee procedure.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(8),","{'title': 'Directive 2002/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nObjectives\n\nThe purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws of the Member States on the restrictions of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment and to contribute to the protection of human health and the environmentally sound recovery and disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nScope\n\n1.

(2) Specific agricultural production conditions in Madeira call for particular attention, and action must be taken or reinforced as regards crop production, in particular the phytosanitary aspects for this region.
(3) The action to be taken or reinforced on the phytosanitary side is particularly costly.
(4) The programme of action has been presented to the Commission by the relevant Portuguese authorities; whereas this programme specifies the objectives to be achieved, the measures to be carried out, their duration and their cost so that the Community may contribute to financing them.

(1) Whereas the request submitted by Italy on 5 March 1999, which reached the Commission on 16 March 1999, contained the information required by Article 8(2)(c); whereas the request concerns the fuelling with compressed natural gas of two types of class-M1 vehicle;
(2) Whereas the reasons given in the request, according to which such vehicle types meet the requirements of Annex IV to Directive 70/156/EEC, apart from those relating to fuelling with compressed natural gas are well founded; whereas the fuelling by compressed natural gas of the vehicles covered by this Decision does, however, guarantee a level equivalent to that provided by petrol fuelling; whereas the tests carried out in accordance with Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from spark-ignition engines of motor vehicles(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 98/77/EC(4), and Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the fuel consumption of motor vehicles(5), as last amended by Commission Directive 93/116/EC(6), were conducted using, in the one instance, natural gas only as fuel and in the other both petrol and natural gas as fuel; whereas the relevant limit values were not exceeded in either fuelling mode, while the recorded emissions of pollutions were lower with natural gas; whereas equivalent environmental protection is thus ensured;
(3) Whereas, in order to assure themselves of the safety of vehicles in service, Member States may periodically carry out leak-tightness tests at a pressure of at least the service pressure;
(4) Whereas the Community Directives concerned will be amended in order to permit the production of vehicles powered by compressed natural gas;

Whereas:
(1) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 (2) certain international standards and interpretations that were in existence at 15 October 2008 were adopted.
(2) On 12 December 2013, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published Annual Improvements to International Reporting Standards 2011-2013 Cycle (the annual improvements), in the framework of its regular improvement process which aims at streamlining and clarifying the standards. The objective of the annual improvements is to address non-urgent, but necessary issues discussed by the IASB during the project cycle that began in 2011 on areas of inconsistency in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or where clarification of wording is required. Amendments to IFRS 3 and 13 are clarifications or corrections to the respective standards. Amendments to International Accounting Standard (IAS) 40 involve changes to the existing requirements or additional guidance on the implementation of those requirements.
(3) Those amendments to existing standards contain some references to IFRS 9 that at present cannot be applied as IFRS 9 has not been adopted by the Union yet. Therefore any references to IFRS 9 as laid down in the Annex to this Regulation should be read as a reference to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
(4) The consultation with the Technical Expert Group of the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group confirms that the improvements meet the technical criteria for adoption set out in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular Articles 46(1), 53(1) and 70(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes (2) lays down restrictions on and certain conditions for the use of substances authorised by Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. As a result of the addition of the use of pieces of oak wood to the list of authorised oenological practices in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, restrictions on and conditions for the use of this material should be laid down. The restrictions and conditions laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the rules approved by the International Organisation of Vine and Wine.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 884/2001 of 24 April 2001 laying down detailed rules of application concerning the documents accompanying the carriage of wine products and the records to be kept in the wine sector (3) lays down rules on the information to be provided in accompanying documents and the keeping of inwards and outwards registers, and provides in particular for the indication of certain operations in the records. The particular characteristics of the use of pieces of oak wood in wine require this use to be indicated in the accompanying documents and the records.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 of 29 April 2002 laying down certain rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products (4) lays down the conditions for using indications concerning the production method. The use of pieces of oak wood in winemaking gives the product a woody flavour similar to that of wines produced in oak casks. It is therefore difficult for the average consumer to determine which of the two methods has been used. Using pieces of oak wood in winemaking is extremely financially attractive to wine producers, and affects the selling price of the product. There is a risk of misleading consumers if the labelling of a wine made using pieces of oak wood contains terms or expressions which may lead them to believe that it has in fact been produced in oak casks. To avoid misleading consumers, and to prevent any distortion of competition between producers, appropriate labelling rules should be laid down.

(2) The German authorities have informed the Commission about the recent evolution of the disease in feral pigs in certain areas of Rhineland-Palatinate Germany bordering North Rhine-Westphalia.
(3) The German and French authorities have informed the Commission about the recent evolution of the disease in feral pigs in certain areas of Rhineland-Palatinate Germany and the bordering areas in France.
(4) This information indicates that classical swine fever in feral pigs has been successfully eradicated in certain areas on the German territory and the vaccination of feral pigs and the eradication plan do not need to be applied anymore in those areas on the German territory.

COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1208/84 (2), and in particular Articles 14a (4), 48 (6) and 65 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1223/83 of 20 May 1983 on the exchange rates to be applied in agriculture (3), and in particular Article 4 (3) thereof,
Whereas, under the first indent of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, a system was introduced for aiding the use, for the manufacture of grape juice, of grape and concentrated grape must produced from grapes grown in the Community; whereas paragraph 2 of the same Article provides that the aid system can also be applied to the use of grapes of Community origin; whereas juice manufacturing practices are such that the aid should also be given for the use of such grapes;
Whereas application of the aid system requires administrative provisions for checking the origin and use of the products for which aid is given;
Whereas the purpose of the aid scheme is to promote the use of products of Community origin for the manufacture of grape juice in place of imported products; whereas the aid should therefore be given to users of the raw material, i.e. to processors;
Whereas in order to ensure that the aid system functions properly and that the checks can be properly carried out, processors should be required to lodge written declarations giving the information necessary for identification of the product and to enable checks on the operations to be carried out;
Whereas, in order for the aid system to have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity which may be covered by a declaration should be set for each product;
Whereas it should be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the quality characteristics required for processing into grape juice; whereas it is consequently necessary to prescribe that grapes and grape must covered by a declaration must have a density of between 1,055 and 1,085 g/cm3 at 20 Â°C;
Whereas Article 14a (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 sets out criteria for fixing the amount of the aid; whereas application of these criteria gives the aid rates for the various products in question fixed below;
Whereas, to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to make the necessary checks, obligations on processors in regard to the keeping of stock records should be laid down, in addition to the provisions of Title II of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (4), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Greece;
Whereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas to allow for technical losses the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;
Whereas for control purposes it is necessary to adopt a processing coefficient as between the grapes employed and the grape juice obtained, based on normal processing methods;
Whereas, in order to be paid aid, applicants must lodge an application accompanied by a number of supporting documents; whereas to ensure that the system operates uniformly in all Member States, time limits for lodging applications and for payment of aid to processors should be laid down;
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 48 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 states that grape juice may not be made into wine or added to wine; whereas, in order to ensure that this prohibition is complied with, special obligations and checks should be specified for processors of and bottlers of grape juice;
Whereas to prevent discrimination between operators and to resolve certain uncertainties as to interpretation that may arise with regard to the representative rates to be applied under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1054/78 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 899/84 (2), it should be specified that for all operations under this Regulation the representative rates applicable should in all cases be those applying in the wine sector on 1 September 1984;

Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC (1) and in particular Article 45(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and in particular Article 43 thereof, provides for the establishment of Advisory Councils which are to promote a balanced representation of all stakeholders in the field of fisheries and aquaculture and to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.
(2) Advisory Councils may submit recommendations and suggestions to the Commission and to the Member States concerned on matters relating to the management of fisheries and the socioeconomic and conservation aspects of fisheries and aquaculture. They may inform the Commission and Member States of problems relating to the management and socioeconomic and conservation aspects of fisheries and aquaculture in their geographical area or field of competence, and contribute, in close cooperation with scientists, to the collection, supply and analysis of data necessary for the development of conservation measures.
(3) While Council Decision 2004/585/EC (2) establishes seven Regional Advisory Councils, Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 comprises also the four new Advisory Councils, established by that Regulation.
(4) Since new Advisory Councils are established by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is necessary to define the procedure for the start of their functioning.
(5) In the light of the important role that the Advisory Councils are expected to play in the regionalised Common Fisheries Policy and in line with the principles of good governance set out in Article 3(b) and (f) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013, it is also necessary to ensure, in line with Article 43(1) of that Regulation, that their structure guarantees a balanced representation of all legitimate stakeholders in the field of fisheries, including small-scale fleets and where appropriate, of aquaculture.
(6) Small-scale fisheries play an important social, economic, environmental and cultural role in numerous coastal communities throughout the European Union. It is therefore necessary to ensure their efficient participation in the work of the Advisory Councils, including by contributing to the costs and loss of income that such participation may entail.
(7) In order to ensure effective functioning and collaboration with stakeholders from third countries, Advisory Councils shall be able to adapt their working methods and reimburse their expenses on case-by case basis,","{'header': '17.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 41/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2015/242\nof 9 October 2014\nlaying down detailed rules on the functioning of the Advisory Councils under the Common Fisheries Policy', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and in particular Article 43 thereof, provides for the establishment of Advisory Councils which are to promote a balanced representation of all stakeholders in the field of fisheries and aquaculture and to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy.\n\n((2)) Advisory Councils may submit recommendations and suggestions to the Commission and to the Member States concerned on matters relating to the management of fisheries and the socioeconomic and conservation aspects of fisheries and aquaculture.

(2) Following the amendments to the nomenclature annexed to the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System pursuant to the recommendation of 25 June 1999 of the Customs Cooperation Council, note 8 to Chapter 29 was inserted and the wording of heading 2937 of the Combined Nomenclature was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2031/2001(3), with effect from 1 January 2002.

Whereas, by letter dated 13 December 1982, the Federal Republic of Germany requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as 'SLM - Spectrofluorometer, model SLM 4800S', ordered in March 1980 and intended to be used for the studies of the structure of proteins and the measurement of the life times of the fluorescent states of excited molecules in proteins and nucleic acids or nucleotides in the subnanosecond region, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops (3) provides for the payment to producers of durum wheat in traditional production zones of a supplement to the compensatory  payment referred to in Title I of that Regulation in order to compensate for the additional loss of income to the producers in question by comparison with producers of other cereals as a result of the setting of a single price for all cereals; whereas  its amount will be based on area sown to durum wheat in the traditional zones that was eligible for the production aid for the 1988/89, 1989/90, 1990/91 or 1991/92 marketing year at the producer's choice;
Whereas, under the Act of Accession, the durum wheat production aid has been introduced gradually in Spain and the full amount paid from the 1992/93 marketing year only; whereas in consequence the aid has had its full economic impact only from the  1992/93 marketing year; whereas for the sake of equity Spanish producers should be able to use 1992/93 as a reference year;
Whereas in Portugal the aid was introduced from the 1991/92 marketing year only; whereas accordingly reference should be made only to areas eligible for the aid for that marketing year; whereas however to give Portuguese durum wheat producers a  possibility of choice it would be reasonable to allow them to use the 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91 marketing years;
Whereas however an excessive increase in the areas eligible for the durum wheat supplement to the compensatory payment in Spain and Portugal should be avoided;
Whereas account should be taken of the situation of durum wheat producers located in certain departments of the south of France which are not regarded as traditional production zones but where durum wheat cultivation is of particular importance owing to  the lack of a viable alternative; whereas this situation should be corrected by classifying the departments in question as traditional production zones; whereas, however, in order to avoid an unjustified increase in the production of durum wheat, the  land eligible for the supplement to the compensatory payment should be limited, by analogy to the treatment applied to producers in traditional zones; whereas, in view of the absence of historical data on the area of durum wheat cultivated by each  producer in the departments in question, the eligible areas in these departments should be restricted to the average of the areas under durum wheat during the same reference period as that used for durum wheat producers in traditional production zones,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 364/93 of 10 February 1993 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 1765/92 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

(1) Commission Decision 2000/96/EC of 22 December 1999, on the communicable diseases to be progressively covered by the Community network under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), lists certain communicable diseases to be covered by epidemiological surveillance in the Community network set up by Decision No 2119/98/EC.
(2) The Annex to Decision No 2119/98/EC specifically mentions ‘vector-borne diseases’ as a category of communicable diseases to be selected in order to achieve uniform information for reporting purposes.
(3) Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a tick-borne disease of humans that causes long-term neurological disabilities and up to 1,4 % fatal outcomes. The disease can be prevented by vaccination and during recent years it has increased in incidence and spread to new geographical areas in Europe. These developments are probably due to different causes, including climate change and modification of tick habitat.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a request submitted in the form of two letters addressed to the Commission, registered by the Commission's Secretariat-General on 9 January 2002, the German Government sought authorisation to introduce a measure derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(2) The other Member States were informed of Germany's request by letter of 16 January 2002.
(3) Article 21(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, in the version of Article 28g of the said Directive, stipulates that, under the internal system, the taxable person supplying taxable goods or services is normally liable to pay value added tax (VAT).
(4) The purpose of the derogation requested by Germany is to make the recipient liable for the value added tax due firstly on the supply, outside a judicial liquidation procedure, of goods provided as security by one VAT taxable person to another in execution of that security and secondly on the supply of immovable property sold at public auction to another VAT taxable person in the course of the judicial liquidation of the enterprise that owned the immovable property sold.
(5) This derogation is intended to simplify the collection of the tax insofar as, in practice, the person normally liable for the tax is, in the instances for which the derogation is sought, generally prevented by financial difficulties from paying the VAT invoiced.
(6) This state of affairs adversely affects public finances in that the recipient of the goods can nonetheless deduct the value added tax invoiced to him, even though it has not been paid by the taxable person who supplied the goods.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Hungary, of the other part(1), provides for further concessions for certain agricultural products originating in Hungary.
(2) Improvements to the preferential agreements of the Europe Agreement with Hungary were provided for in the Protocol for the adaptation of the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Hungary, of the other part, to take into account the accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the European Union and the results of the agricultural negotiations of the Uruguay Round including the improvements of the existing preferential regime(2). The Council approved the abovementioned Protocol on behalf of the Community by Council Decision 1999/67/EC(3).
(3) In accordance with the directives adopted by the Council on 30 March 1999, the Commission and the Republic of Hungary concluded on 14 April 2000 negotiations on a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement.
(4) The new Additional Protocol, which provides for additional agricultural concessions, will be based on Article 20(5) of the Europe Agreement, establishing that the Community and Hungary are to examine in the Association Council, product by product and on an ordely and reciprocal basis, the possibility of granting each other further concessions.
(5) A swift implementation of the adjustments forms an essential part of the results of the negotiations for the conclusion of a new Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement with Hungary.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to provide for the adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Hungary.
(7) The Republic of Hungary will make all useful legislative provisions, on an autonomous and transitional basis, in order to enable a rapid and simultaneous implementation of the adaptation of the agricultural concessions of the Republic of Hungary provided for in the Europe Agreement.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar (1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),

(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2) specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

(3) A carcase-weight equivalent needs to be fixed in order to ensure a proper functioning of the tariff quotas. Furthermore, certain tariff quotas provide the option of importing either the live animals or their meat. A conversion factor is therefore required.
(4) As the imports are managed on a calendar year basis, the quantities foreseen for 2001 are the sum of half of the quantity for the period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 and half of the quantity for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 367/76 (2), and in particular Articles 15 (6) and 22 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2768/75 of 29 October 1975 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on pigmeat and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), and in particular Article 7 (3) thereof,
Whereas Article 8 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 192/75 of 17 January 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2838/77 (5), provides that no refund is to be granted where the products or goods in the form in which they are exported are not of sound and fair marketable quality;
Whereas it has been shown, however, that these requirements are not sufficient for certain products listed in Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75, to ensure the application of uniform conditions for the payment of refunds;
Whereas additional conditions relating to products of average quality and enabling the payment of refunds on products of inferior quality to be refused should consequently be laid down on a Community basis;
Whereas it is essential to provide controls to ensure compliance with this Regulation ; whereas controls carried out by sampling and consisting of an organoleptic examination and physical and chemical analyses seem adequate seeing that it is provided that the application for a refund is to be accompanied by a written declaration stating that the products in question comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation;
Whereas in order to ensure standardization of the physical and chemical controls it is necessary to apply certain clearly defined analyses;
Whereas, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2333/77 of 25 October 1977 amending Regulation No 204/67/EEC fixing coefficients for calculating levies on pigmeat products other than pig carcases and Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 on the Common Customs Tariff (6), the wording of tariff heading No 16.02 has been changed with effect from I November 1977 ; whereas for the sake of clarity, this new wording should apply from the same date for the special conditions for granting refunds;
Whereas the description of other products which are the subject of refunds and the references to the basic regulations concerned have also been changed ; whereas, therefore, for the sake of administrative simplicity, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2403/69 of 1 December 1969 on special conditions for granting export refunds on certain pigmeat products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2854/71 (8), should be repealed;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(1) The Commission has received an application for a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. The application was lodged by Joint Stock Company Acron (the applicant), an exporting producer in Russia (the country concerned).
B.   PRODUCT
(2) The product under review is mixtures of urea and ammonium nitrate in aqueous or ammoniacal solution originating in Russia (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN code 3102 80 00.
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1911/2006 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Russia, and produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 20,11 per tonne with the exception of one company expressly mentioned which is subject to an individual duty.
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e., the period from 1 June 1998 to 31 May 1999 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures.
(5) The applicant further alleges that it began exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.
E.   PROCEDURE
(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given and opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.
(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.
(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1911/2006.
(a) Questionnaires
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
(a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation;
(b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).
J.   HEARING OFFICER
(14) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this investigation, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Azores and Madeira and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 (Poseima)(1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1453/2001 provides that Community aid is to be granted for the direct processing of sugar cane produced on Madeira into sugar syrup or agricultural rum as defined in Article 1(4)(a)(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3378/94 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3).
(2) This aid is paid on condition that the sugar-cane producer is paid a minimum price, up to a maximum annual quantity of 2500 hectolitres of agricultural rum at 71,8Â° or, in the case of sugar syrup, a maximum annual quantity of 250 tonnes. The aid is calculated in such as way that the ratio between the two aid amounts takes account of the quantities of raw material used. In the interests of clarity the amounts for rum should be expressed as pure alcohol.
(3) A minimum price should be fixed for sugar cane intended for the manufacture of sugar syrup or rum which takes account of the consultations held by the Government of the Autonomous Region of Madeira with sugar-cane producers and the businesses processing the cane into syrup and rum.
(4) To facilitate application of the annual processing limits, this Regulation should apply from the beginning of the 2002 calendar year.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1410/2002 of 1 August 2002 concerning aid for the processing of sugar cane into sugar syrup or agricultural rum on Madeira', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.
