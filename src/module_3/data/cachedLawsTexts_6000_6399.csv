Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Sheep pox is an infectious viral disease of sheep and goats with a severe impact on the profitability of ovine farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of sheep pox, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other ovine holdings within that Member State and also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live ovine or their products.
(3) Council Directive 92/119/EEC (2) sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus and to eradicate the disease.
(4) In accordance with Article 84 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.
(5) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 3 of that Decision, Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate sheep pox.
(6) Article 3(6) of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union.
(7) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate sheep pox is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 (4).
(8) Outbreaks of sheep pox occurred in Bulgaria in 2013 and in Greece in 2013 and 2014. Bulgaria and Greece have taken measures in accordance with Directive 92/119/EEC to combat those outbreaks.
(9) The authorities of Bulgaria and Greece informed the Commission and the other Member States in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of the measures applied in accordance with Union legislation on notification and eradication of the disease and the results thereof.
(10) The authorities of Bulgaria and Greece have therefore fulfilled their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 3(4) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.

(5) It is appropriate to grant an extension of this period for an additional period of eight years starting on 1 January 1998 or until the date of Bulgaria's accession to the European Union, whichever comes first.
(6) To this effect, an Additional Protocol to the Europe Agreement was signed by the Community and Bulgaria on 21 November 2002 and is provisionally applied from that date.
(7) Pursuant to Article 2 of the Additional Protocol, the extension of the abovementioned period is made conditional on the submission by Bulgaria to the Commission of a restructuring programme and business plans that meet the requirements of Article 9(4) of Protocol 2 of the Europe Agreement and have been assessed and agreed by its national State aid authority (the Commission for Protection of Competition).
(8) In March 2004, Bulgaria submitted to the Commission a restructuring programme and a business plan for its only company having benefited or benefiting of a State support for restructuring.
(9) Pursuant to Article 3 of the Additional Protocol, the extension of the abovementioned period is made conditional on a final assessment of the restructuring programme and business plans by the Commission.
(10) The Commission has made a final assessment of the restructuring programme and the business plan submitted by Bulgaria; this assessment indicates that the implementation of the restructuring programme and the business plan will allow the company concerned to reach viability under normal market conditions. It also shows that the amount of State aid for restructuring purposes as specified in the plan is strictly limited to what is necessary to allow the company concerned to reach viability and will be progressively reduced and stopped by 2005. The assessment provides also that a global rationalisation and reduction of excess capacity of the beneficiary company will be reached.

(1) Decision ECB/2004/5 of 22 April 2004 on the national central banks' percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank's capital (1) laid down with effect from 1 May 2004 the weightings assigned to those national central banks (NCBs) that were members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) on 1 May 2004 in the key for subscription to the ECB's capital (hereinafter the ‘capital key weightings’ and the ‘capital key’ respectively).
(2) In view of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union and their respective NCBs joining the ESCB on 1 January 2007, the ECB's subscribed capital should automatically be increased pursuant to Article 49.3 of the Statute. This increase requires the calculation of the capital key weighting of each NCB that will be a member of the ESCB on 1 January 2007 by analogy with Article 29.1 and in compliance with Article 29.2 of the Statute. The ECB's expanded capital key and each NCB's capital key weighting will apply with effect from 1 January 2007. Decision ECB/2004/5 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new decision which reflects the updated position.
(3) In accordance with Council Decision 2003/517/EC of 15 July 2003 on the statistical data to be used for the adjustment of the key for subscription to the capital of the European Central Bank (2), the European Commission has provided the ECB with the statistical data to be used in determining the expanded capital key.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

(3) The Amsterdam Resolution of the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact of 17 June 1997(1) solemnly invites all parties, namely the Member States, the Council and the Commission to implement the Treaty and the Stability and Growth pact in a strict and timely manner.
(4) The excessive deficit procedure under Article 104 provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93(2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provision of the said Protocol.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. The Commission addressed such an opinion on France to the Council on 7 May 2003. According to this opinion:
- following publication by the Commission of the first notification on deficit and debt data for 2002, showing that the general Government deficit in France reached 3,1 % of GDP in that year, the Commission, in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty, adopted on 2 April 2003 a report on France which takes account of the relevant factors,
- in accordance with Article 104(4) of the Treaty, the Economic and Financial Committee formulated an opinion on the report of the Commission,
- the Commission considers that there exists an excessive deficit in France.
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before the Council decides, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists.
(7) The overall assessment leads to the following conclusions. The general Government deficit reached 3,1 % of GDP in 2002 in France. Although budgetary developments have been adversely affected by continued weakness in economic activity, the excess of the general Government deficit over the 3 % of GDP reference value does not result, in the meaning of the Treaty, from an unusual event outside the control of the French authorities, nor is it the result of a severe economic downturn. According to Commission calculations, the deterioration in the 2002 budgetary position results mainly from a worsening in the cyclically-adjusted budgetary position. The breaching of the 3 % of GDP threshold in 2002 is also rooted in the reversal of the budgetary consolidation process which took place since 1999, and is likely not to be temporary. Indeed, according to the French authorities and to the Commission Spring 2003 forecasts, the general Government deficit will be above 3 % of GDP also in 2003. Finally, the debt ratio will increase further in 2003, and will very likely breach the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value in that year,","{'title': '2003/487/EC: Council Decision of 3 June 2003 on the existence of an excessive deficit in France — application of Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in France.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 3 June 2003.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nN.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Existing measures
(1) By Council Regulation (EC) No 2320/97(3), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 235/2004((4)), and by Regulation (EC) No 348/2000(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1515/2002(6), (the original Regulations), the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping duties of 26,8 % on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating, inter alia, in Russia and of 38,5 % on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating, inter alia, in Ukraine.
(2) On 23 November 2002, the Commission initiated an interim and expiry review of the abovementioned measures concerning imports from Russia(7) pursuant to Articles 11(2) and 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation) and an interim review of the abovementioned measures concerning imports from Ukraine(8) pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation. These investigations are still ongoing.
2. Request
(3) On 2 June 2003, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine. The request was submitted by the Defence Committee of the Seamless Steel Tube Industry of the European Union (the Applicant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, i.e. over 50 % of the Community production of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel.
(4) The request contained sufficient prima facie evidence that there had been a significant change in the pattern of trade, as imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine have decreased substantially following the imposition of measures on the products concerned, while certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel, other than stainless steel, declared under Combined Nomenclature(9) (CN) codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 and originating in Russia and Ukraine had increased during the same time span.
(5) This change in the pattern of trade was alleged to stem either from the practice that minimal quantities of other substances are being added to the product concerned, so that they fall outside the CN codes corresponding to the definition of the products subject to the measures (CN codes ex 7304 10 10, ex 7304 10 30, 7304 31 99, 7304 39 91 and 7304 39 93 ), notwithstanding the fact that the basic characteristics and uses of the products remain unchanged, or from the practice of wrongly declaring the product concerned under CN codes outside the scope of the anti-dumping measures. It was further alleged that there was insufficient due cause or economic justification for these practices other than the existence of the anti-dumping duties on certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine.
(6) Finally, the Applicant alleged that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping duties on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine were being undermined, both in terms of quantities and prices, and that dumping was taking place in relation to the normal values previously established.
3. Initiation
(7) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1264/2003(10) (the initiating Regulation), the Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine and, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, directed the customs authorities to register imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel, and of certain seamless pipes and tubes of alloy steel, other than stainless steel declared under CN codes 7304 59 91 and 7304 59 93 and originating in Russia and Ukraine as from 17 July 2003.
4. Investigation
(8) The Commission advised the authorities of Russia and Ukraine of the initiation of the investigation. Questionnaires were sent to the producers and exporters in Russia and Ukraine as well as to the importers in the Community named in the request or known to the Commission from the previous investigations. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation.
(9) Replies to the questionnaires were submitted by five producers in Russia, three producers in Ukraine, one exporter in Russia, two exporters in Ukraine and one trader in Switzerland. Replies to the questionnaire were also submitted by eight traders/importers in the Community. The Commission carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies:
Russian producers:
- Taganrog Mettalurgical Works, Taganrog, Russia,
- OJSC Volzhsky Pipe Works, Volzskhy, Russia;
Russian exporter:
- CJSC Trade House TMK, Moscow, Russia;
Ukrainian producers:
- Dnepropetrovsk Tube Works, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine,
- Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine,
- Nikopolsky Seamless Tubes Plant, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine;
Ukrainian exporters:
- Scientific Production Investment Group, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine;
- AACS, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine;
Trader related to the Ukrainian company Scientific Production Investment Group:
- Sepco S.A, Lugano, Switzerland;
Unrelated importers/traders in the Community:
- RWH, Germany,
- Eurosinara SRL, Italy,
- Merigo SPA, Italy.
5. Investigation period
(10) The investigation period covered the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003 (the IP). Data was collected from the year 2000 up to the IP to investigate the change in the pattern of trade.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION
(11) By a letter of 9 February 2004, the applicant formally withdrew its request to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Russia and Ukraine.
(12) An investigation of alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures may, in cases where the request for investigation has been withdrawn, be terminated. By the analogous application of the provisions of Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, such termination may take place unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(13) The Commission considered that, in the absence of information showing that termination of the investigation would not be in the Community interest, the present investigation should be terminated.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 7 November 1997 accepting undertakings in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland (97/797/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2), and in particular Article 8 (1) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) The Commission by Regulation (EC) No 1023/97 (3) imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on certain imports of flat pallets of wood falling within CN code ex 4415 20 20 originating in the Republic of Poland and accepted undertakings offered from certain producers. These undertakings concerned only one pallet type, i.e. the EUR pallet.
(2) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1632/97 (4), the above provisional Regulation was amended adding a provision whereby genuine new Polish exporters can be attributed the weighted average duty applicable to co-operating companies not included in the sample of exporters investigated and can have undertakings accepted with regard to exports of EUR-pallets.
(3) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 1633/97 (5), in application of the abovementioned new provision, the provisional Regulation was further amended by including a number of genuine new exporters in the list of companies receiving the weighted average duty and by accepting undertakings from some of such new exporters.
B. DEFINITIVE DETERMINATION
(4) The Commission continued to seek and verify all information that it deemed necessary for the purpose of its definitive findings. In the course of this investigation, it was established that definitive anti-dumping measures in the form of an ad valorem duty and, where applicable, price undertakings, should be taken in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. The findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigation are set out in the Commission's proposal to the Council to impose a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of wooden pallets originating in Poland (6).
C. NEW EXPORTERS' REQUEST
(5) Following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1633/97, eight further new Polish exporting producers have applied not to be treated differently from the companies which co-operated in the proceeding but were not included in the sample and have offered undertakings with regard to the EUR-pallet. They have provided, on request, evidence showing that they are genuine new exporters, which is considered sufficient to accept the undertakings offered by them with regard to the EUR-pallet.
(6) Two Polish exporters included in the list of companies receiving the weighted average duty have now offered undertakings with regard to the EUR-pallet which are considered acceptable,","{'title': '97/797/EC: Commission Decision of 7 November 1997 accepting undertakings in connection with the anti- dumping proceeding concerning imports of flat pallets of wood originating in the Republic of Poland', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe undertakings offered with regard to the EUR-pallet by:\n\n- MACED Sklad Palet, Jadwiga Macionga, PL-77-200 Miastko\n\n- ENKEL Spólka Cywilna, PL-24-100 Pulawy\n\n- Produkcja Stolarska Posrednictwo Export-Import, W.i.T.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003 of 27 June 2003 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004)(2) provides for the opening of a tariff quota from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2004 for 50700 tonnes of frozen beef intended for processing. Article 9 of that Regulation provides for the reallocation of unused quantities on the basis of the actual utilisation of import rights for A-products and B-products respectively by the end of February 2004.
(2) An operator submitted an application for import rights for 225 tonnes of beef for the production of A-products under Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1146/2003. As a result of an administrative error by the competent Danish authority, the application from that operator, forwarded to the Commission in accordance with Article 5(3), concerned 40 tonnes only. The national administration discovered the error only on completion of the procedure for the allocation of import rights referred to in Article 5(4) and notified the Commission accordingly. In order that the operator who submitted the application correctly should not be put at a disadvantage, the necessary measures should be taken to permit the competent Danish authority to remedy the administrative error in an appropriate way.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 30 June 1992  accepting the Egyptian producer's undertaking in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ferro-silicon originating in Poland and Egypt  (92/331/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE  EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for in the said Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1808/12 (2) imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of ferro-silicon originating in Poland and Egypt and falling with CN codes 7202 21 10, 7202 21 90 and 7202 29 000.
B. UNDERTAKINGS
(2) All the producers concerned had been informed of the outcome of the investigation, but the Egyptian producer EFACO (The Egyptian Ferro-Alloys Co.,) gave an undertaking in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
(3) On the basis of recitals 35 and 36 of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/92, the effect of this undertaking would be to increase import prices in the Community by an amount considered sufficient, in the present circumstances, to eliminate the injury resulting  from dumping.
(4) The Commission considers this offer to be acceptable, and so the investigation can be terminated in respect of the said Egyptian producer.
(5) The Commission nevertheless notes the very tense situation on the Community market in ferro-silicon. The Community authorities therefore need to keep a close eye on exporters' competitive behaviour on the Community market and on the Community  industry's financial and trade situation.
(6) The Commission would also point out that where a undertaking has been withdrawn or where the Commission has reason to believe that it has been violated and where Community interests call for such intervention, the Commission may, in accordance with
Article 10
(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, apply provisional anti-dumping duties forthwith on the basis of the facts established before acceptance of the undertaking.
(7) When the Anti-Dumping Committee was consulted about acceptance of the undertaking, no objection was raised.","{'title': ""92/331/EEC: Commission Decision of 30 June 1992 accepting the Egyptian producer's undertaking in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ferro-silicon originating in Poland and Egypt"", 'articles': [{'id': '10', 'title': 'Article 10', 'text': 'Article 10\n\n(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, apply provisional anti-dumping duties forthwith on the basis of the facts established before acceptance of the undertaking.\n\n(7) When the Anti-Dumping Committee was consulted about acceptance of the undertaking, no objection was raised.\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\nSole Article\n\nThe undertaking given by the Egyptian producer EFACO in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ferro-silicon originating in Egypt and Poland is hereby accepted.\n\nThis undertaking shall take effect from the day of entry into force of Regulation (EEC) No 1808/12.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(2) These quantities were set, for the 2005/06 delivery period, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 180/2006 (3).

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1), and in particular Article 29(4)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 29(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 provides that payments under support schemes listed in Annex 1 to that Regulation are to be made within the period from 1 December to 30 June of the following year. However, Article 29(4)(a) of that Regulation permits the Commission to provide for advances.
(2) Article 29(5) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 provides that Member States may, from 16 October 2014, pay advances of up to 50 % of the direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex 1 to that Regulation in respect of applications made in 2014.
(3) The decision of Russia to impose a ban on imports of agricultural products from the Union has caused severe financial problems in the agricultural sectors of several Member States, of which Latvia and Lithuania requested to be authorised to provide for advances exceeding the 50 % referred to in Article 29(5) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(4) In order to help to alleviate these difficulties by making it possible for farmers to absorb losses following the embargo until a stabilization of markets is obtained it is appropriate to allow for farmers in Latvia and Lithuania to receive advance payments of up to 70 % of the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(5) According to Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), the Commission may adapt the adjustment rate for direct payments until 1 December on the basis of new information in its possession. As a consequence, the adjustment rate of financial discipline referred to in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) eventually applied may not be known by 16 October 2014. Therefore the maximum advances that can be paid should be set as a percentage of the direct payments before the adjustment referred to in Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. The balance payment as from 1 December 2014 should take into account the adjustment rate of financial discipline applicable at that time.
(6) In order to enable payment of the advances as of 16 October 2014, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) has been the subject of a review by the Working Group on Outdoor Equipment, set up by the Commission.
(2) In its report dated 8 July 2004, this Working Group concluded that a number of the stage II limits due to be mandatorily applied as from 3 January 2006 were not technically feasible. However, the intention was never to restrict the placing on the market or putting into service of equipment solely based on technical feasibility.
(3) It is therefore necessary to provide that certain types of equipment listed in Article 12 of Directive 2000/14/EC, which would not be able to meet the stage II limits by 3 January 2006 solely for technical reasons, can still be placed on the market and/or put into service as from that date.
(4) The experience of the first five years of application of Directive 2000/14/EC has demonstrated that more time is needed to fulfil the provisions under Articles 16 and 20 thereof and highlighted the need to review that Directive with a view to its possible amendment, in particular with respect to the stage II limits referred to therein. It is therefore necessary to extend by two years the deadline for submission of the report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the Commission’s experience in implementing and administering Directive 2000/14/EC as referred to in Article 20(1) of that Directive.
(5) Article 20(3) of Directive 2000/14/EC provides for the submission, by the Commission, of a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on whether, and to what extent, technical progress allows a reduction of limit values for lawnmowers and lawn trimmers/lawn-edge trimmers. In view of the fact that the obligations contained in Article 20(1) of that Directive are more prescriptive than those in Article 20(3), and in order to avoid duplication of effort, it is appropriate to include these types of equipment in the general report provided for in Article 20(1) of that Directive. Consequently, the separate reporting obligation in Article 20(3) of that Directive should be deleted.
(6) Since the objective of this Directive, namely, to ensure the ongoing functioning of the internal market by requiring equipment used outdoors to comply with harmonised environmental noise provisions, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective, in that its scope is confined to those types of equipment for which compliance with the stage II limits is presently impossible for technical reasons.
(7) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law making (4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.
(8) Directive 2000/14/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '27.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/44', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2005/88/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14\xa0December 2005\namending Directive 2000/14/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the noise emission in the environment by equipment for use outdoors\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2000/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)has been the subject of a review by the Working Group on Outdoor Equipment, set up by the Commission.\n\n((2)) In its report dated 8\xa0July 2004, this Working Group concluded that a number of the stage\xa0II limits due to be mandatorily applied as from 3\xa0January 2006 were not technically\xa0feasible.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective, in that its scope is confined to those types of equipment for which compliance with the stage\xa0II limits is presently impossible for technical reasons.\n\n((7)) In accordance with point\xa034 of the Interinstitutional agreement on better law\xa0making(4), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and\xa0in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.\n\n((8)) Directive\xa02000/14/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article\xa01', 'text': 'Article\xa01\nDirective 2000/14/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nThe table in Article\xa012 shall be replaced by the following:\n‘Type of equipment\nNet installed power\nP\n(in kW)\nElectric power\nP\nel\n(\n5\n)\nin kW\nMass of appliance\nm\nin kg\nCutting width\nL\nin cm\nPermissible sound power level in dB/1 pW\nStage I as from 3\xa0January 2002\nStage II as from 3\xa0January 2006\nCompaction machines (vibrating rollers, vibratory plates, vibratory rammers)\nP\n≤ 8\n108\n105\n(\n6\n)\n8 < P ≤ 70\n109\n106\n(\n6\n)\nP\n> 70\n89 + 11 lg\nP\n86 + 11 lg\nP\n(\n6\n)\nTracked dozers, tracked loaders, tracked excavator-loaders\nP\n≤ 55\n106\n103\n(\n6\n)\nP\n> 55\n87 + 11 lg\nP\n84 + 11 lg\nP\n(\n6\n)\nWheeled dozers, wheeled loaders, wheeled excavator-loaders, dumpers, graders, loader-type landfill compactors, combustion-engine driven counterbalanced lift trucks, mobile cranes, compaction machines (non-vibrating rollers), paver-finishers, hydraulic power packs\nP\n≤ 55\n104\n101\n(\n6\n)\n(\n7\n)\nP\n> 55\n85 + 11 lg\nP\n82 + 11 lg\nP\n(\n6\n)\n(\n7\n)\nExcavators, builders’ hoists for the transport of goods, construction winches, motor hoes\nP\n≤ 15\n96\n93\nP\n> 15\n83 + 11 lg\nP\n80 + 11 lg\nP\nHand-held concrete-breakers and picks\nm\n≤ 15\n107\n105\n15 <\nm\n< 30\n94 + 11 lg\nm\n92 + 11 lg\nm\n(\n6\n)\nm\n≥ 30\n96 + 11 lg\nm\n94 + 11 lg\nm\nTower cranes\n98 + lg\nP\n96 + lg\nP\nWelding and power generators\nP\nel\n≤ 2\n97 + lg\nP\nel\n95 + lg\nP\nel\n2 <\nP\nel\n≤ 10\n98 + lg\nP\nel\n96 + lg\nP\nel\n10 >\nP\nel\n97 + lg\nP\nel\n95 + lg\nP\nel\nCompressors\nP\n≤ 15\n99\n97\nP\n> 15\n97 + 2 lg\nP\n95 + 2 lg\nP\nLawnmowers, lawn trimmers/lawn-edge trimmers\nL\n≤50\n96\n94\n(\n6\n)\n50 <\nL\n≤ 70\n100\n98\n70 <\nL\n≤ 120\n100\n98\n(\n6\n)\nL\n> 120\n105\n103\n(\n6\n)\nThe permissible sound power level shall be rounded up or down to the nearest integer number (less than 0,5, use lower number; greater than or equal to\xa00,5, use higher number)’\n2.\nArticle\xa020 shall be amended as follows:\n(a)\nIn the first sentence of paragraph\xa01, the words ‘Not later than 3\xa0January\xa02005’ shall be replaced by ‘Not later than 3\xa0January\xa02007’;\n(b)\nParagraph\xa03 shall be deleted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article\xa02', 'text': 'Article\xa02\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to\xa0comply with this Directive by 31\xa0December 2005 at the latest.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 (2), establishes common rules for notifying information and documents by Member States to the Commission. Those rules cover in particular the obligation for the Member States to use the information systems made available by the Commission and the validation of the access rights of the authorities or individuals authorised to send notifications. Regulation (EC) No 792/2009 also sets common principles applying to the information systems so that they guarantee the authenticity, integrity and legibility over time of the documents and provides for personal data protection. The obligation to use those information systems has to be provided for in each Regulation establishing a specific notification obligation.
(2) The Commission has developed an information system that allows managing documents and procedures electronically in its own internal working procedures and in its relations with the authorities involved in the common agricultural policy.
(3) Several communication and notification obligations can be fulfilled via that system, in particular those provided for in Commission Regulations (EC) No 952/2006 (3), (EC) No 967/2006 (4), (EC) No 555/2008 (5) and (EC) No 1249/2008 (6).
(4) In the interest of efficient administration and taking account of the experience, some communications and notifications should be simplified, specified or deleted.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 foresees in its Article 100(2) a simplified notification when only zero values have to be communicated. Since the information system includes a simplified procedure for sending these notifications, the notification procedure of this Article is no longer necessary.
(6) In Regulation 1249/2008, a supplementary notification on the slaughter of cattle with a view to calculate the weighing coefficient referred to in its Article 18 should be established.
(7) Regulations (EC) No 952/2006, (EC) No 967/2006, (EC) No 555/2008, and (EC) No 1249/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 of 27 June 1980 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (2), and in particular Article 5 (10) thereof,
Whereas Article 35 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 repeals Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, with the exception of the measures provided for in Article 5 of the latter Regulation, which remain applicable to the premiums granted in respect of the 1989 marketing year;
Whereas Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the grant of a premium to offset any loss of income sustained by producers of sheepmeat and, in certain areas, of goatmeat; whereas those areas are listed in Annex III to that Regulation and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86 (4); whereas Article 5 (9) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 provides for the possibility of the premium being granted to producers keeping females of the ovine species of certain mountain breeds other than ewes which are eligible for the premium in certain areas; whereas those ewes and areas are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1970/87 (6);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the loss of income represents, per 100 kilograms of carcase weight, any difference there may be between the basic price and the arithmetic mean of the market prices recorded for each region;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80, the amount of the premium payable per ewe and per region is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in paragraph 2 by a coefficient representing, for each region, the normal average annual production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms of carcase weight; whereas, however, for region 5, that loss of income must be reduced by the weighted average of the variable premiums actually granted for the 1989 marketing year, such average being obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 6 of that Article; whereas Article 5 (3) also fixes the amount of the premium payable per female of the caprine species at 80 % of the premium per ewe; whereas, pursuant to Article 5 (9), the amount of the premium per female of the ovine species, other than a ewe which is eligible for the premium, is also fixed at 80 % of the premium per ewe;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 the amount of the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in Article 9a (2); whereas that coefficient was corrected by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1305/90 of 18 May 1990 on the definitive application of the guarantee limitation arrangements for sheepmeat and goatmeat for the 1989 marketing year (7);
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3120/89 (8) authorizes the Member States to pay an advance to producers located in less-favoured agricultural areas; whereas such an advance was paid during the 1989 marketing year to the producers in question;
Whereas the French Government has decided to come to the assistance of farmers whose holdings are located in areas which are not less favoured; whereas, to that end, the French Government has contemplated making an advance to them also, but out of national funds, of an amount corresponding to 50 % of the ewe premium which such farmers may claim at the end of the marketing year;
Whereas the French Government has notified the Commission of that planned national aid in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the Treaty;
Whereas the Council decided by decision of 25 September 1989 to regard the national aid in the form of a payment on account of the premium for ewes, granted by the French Government to French sheepmeat producers whose holdings are located in areas of France which are not less favoured, as being compatible with the common market, up to a rate of 50 % of the estimated premium and until the end of the 1989 marketing year;
Whereas the premium payable per eligible animal is paid only if the amount fixed per ewe is one ecu or more;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 5 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1873/80, the amount of the definitive premium and the balance to be paid in less-favoured agricultural areas should be fixed;

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 30 November 1989
concerning measures to assist the Belgian inland waterway fleet contained in the plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(89/620/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the interested parties to submit their comments in accordance with the abovementioned Article,
Whereas,
I
The Belgian Government is considering introducing, for the period 1987 to 1991, an aid regime for its inland waterway fleet under a plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet.
This regime provides for state aid in the form of interest relief on loans for boat-building, buying second-hand vessels and modernization; it also provides for boat-scrapping premiums, social benefits for early retirement or leaving the industry, and certain other benefits of a fiscal nature. An overall budget of Bfrs 775 million has been provided for, which does not, however, include the cost of financing the social measures.
Having been notified of this regime, the Commission proceeded to examine it under Article 92 of the EEC Treaty, as a result of which it decided that the aid in question, essentially aimed at renewing and modernizing the Belgian inland waterway fleet, without requiring of its recipients any definite reciprocation in terms of restructuring the sector, would consitute aid likely to affect trade and distort competition in a manner incompatible with the common market, and did not seem to meet the conditions for any of the derogations in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty. Consequently, the Commission decided to open the procedure provided for in the first paragraph of Article 93 (2), and to this end gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments in letter SG(88)D O3370 of 15 March 1988; the other Member States were informed on 25 April 1988 and other interested parties on 29 April 1988.
II
In letter P11/91/553/12.688 of 29 September 1988 from its Permanent Representative, the Belgian Government submitted its comments under the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty.
According to the Belgian Government the planned restructuring of the fleet was only to prevent its further decline so that the Belgian fleet could improve its competitiveness vis-Ă -vis the fleets of other Member States. This aid was indispensable to the sector's survival; the decline in both the quantity and quality of the Belgian fleet, which had deteriorated further since the plan was presented to the Commission, proved this.
The Belgian Government also stated that it was abandoning aid for building new boats and redirecting the sums earmarked for this to bolstering other types of aid envisaged in the plan. The plan's other components remained unchanged.
During the procedure, some Member States and a trade organization submitted their comments to the Commission, which then transmitted them to the Belgian Government.
III
The plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet would enable it, according to the Belgian Government, to become more competitive vis-Ă -vis other Member States' fleets operating in the same transport markets. The Belgian fleet's position in relation to its competitors was to be improved by modernizing existing vessels. This modernization would raise the productivity of these vessels, leading to an increase in capacity.
It should be noted that the inland waterway market is afflicted by a pronounced structural imbalance between transport supply and demand, due mainly to an overcapacity estimated at 20 % of the deadweight tonnage of the Member States' fleets. Moreover, the evolution of the market shows that, despite measures taken at national level by the countries affected, the current imbalance is not being corrected. It must be said also that the existing overcapacity is economically damaging to inland waterway freight carriers. Aid for modernization should also be assessed in terms of the system introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 of 27 April 1989 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (1). This Regulation is aimed at reducing structural overcapacity by coordinating scrapping schemes in Belgium, Germany, France and the Netherlands and includes provisions to prevent existing overcapacity increasing or extra overcapacity entering service. With regard to this last aspect of the Regulation, modernizing measures are incompatible with the Community Regulation if they increase capacity. Since 28 April 1989 any carrier increasing capacity has been obliged to scrap an equivalent tonnage or to pay a special contribution to one of the national scrapping funds.
With regard to the interest subsidies for the purchase of second-hand vessels by Belgian carriers, this aid constitutes a distortion of competition detrimental to other Member States' carriers, because they are operating in the same transport markets as Belgian boatmen.
In view of these considerations, the aid in question is likely to affect trade between Member States and to distort competition, within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty, by discriminating against the other fleets concerned and in favour of the Belgian fleet.
IV
The plan submitted by the Belgian Government envisages measures to scrap inland waterway vessels which should in principle lead to a reduction in current overcapacity. However, this reduction is not guaranteed because the plan includes no measures to prevent the effects of scrapping being cancelled out by increases in capacity.
The scrapping schemes provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, include procedures different from those envisaged by the Belgian Government. They will become operational from 1 January 1990 and Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 imposes their cost on the carriers themselves. In view of this, financing scrapping schemes by State aid will be incompatible with the provisions of the abovementioned Regulation after 1 January.
V
Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty states that in principle, certain types of aid are incompatible with the common market. The derogations from this principle enumerated in Article 92 (2) of the Treaty are not applicable to this case in view of the nature and purpose of the aid envisaged.
Under Article 92 (3) of the Treaty, aid which may be considered to be compatible with the common market shall be assessed in terms of the Community and not of an individual Member State. In the interests of the sound working of the common market and taking into account the principles stated in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, derogations from the principle of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty enumerated in the third paragraph of that Article must be interpreted restrictively when any aid scheme or individual aid measure is being examined.
In particular, derogations can only by permitted if the Commission recognizes that the free play of market forces alone, in the absence of aid, is insufficient to prompt the aid's potential recipients to act to achieve the desired objectives.
Applying these derogations in cases where they do not contribute to such an objective or where they are not essential to its achievement, would give unfair advantages to industries or firms in some Member States, who would find their financial position artificially bolstered and would affect trade between Member States and distort competition, without being justified by the common interest referred to in Article 92 (3).
The Belgian Government has been unable to furnish, and the Commission unable to discern, any reason for classing the aid in question under any of the categories of derogations listed in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
With regard to the derogations under Article 92 (3) (b), it is evident that the aid in question is not designed to promote a project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy.
The Belgian Government has not even attempted to invoke such motives to justify the aid in question.
With regard to derogation under (c), the aid planned by the Belgian Government is not such that it would facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of this provision.
Finally, as regards the derogation provided for under Article 92 (3) (c), for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, it should be borne in mind that the aid in question, although facilitating the development of the Belgian fleet, does not facilitate the development of the inland waterway sector of Community
level and affects trade within the Community in a manner contrary to the common interest given that sector's current overcapacity.
To be covered by this derogation, restructuring of the Belgian fleet to meet the requirements of the inland waterway market should only involve measures guaranteeing that this restructuring would be accompanied by a reduction in current overcapacity. No such guarantee is to be found in the present plan.
Furthermore, it should be added that Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport envisages a common European approach to remedy the present overcapacity in the inland waterway sector, and that the Belgian plan is incompatible with the Regulation's provisions concerning the financing of scrapping.
VI
The plan submitted by the Belgian authorities also included aid for cessation of activity for boatmen who are at least 55 years of age and renounce all activity, both direct and indirect, in the industry. This aid could be paid, until the legal retirement age, in the form of a monthly allowance with a ceiling of Bfrs 30 000 per month, minus any early retirement pension. This measure of a social nature, even taken in isolation, is admissible on the basis of the derogation in Article 92 (3) (c), of the EEC Treaty. In effect, the cessation of activity by some boatmen, who will no longer be competing within the industry, could be regarded as contributing to the general improvement of conditions in the sector at both national and Community level.
The aid in question would not adversely affect trading conditions in a manner contrary to the common interest. Moreover, the social measures envisaged by the Belgian Government are covered by the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 concerning the measures which Member States may take to make it easier for inland waterway carriers leaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or transfer to another economic activity.
To conclude, the aid for Belgian boatmen envisaged in the plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet is, except for aid to leaving the occupation, incompatible with the common market and cannot be implemented,","{'title': '89/620/EEC: Commission Decision of 30 November 1989 concerning measures to assist the Belgian inland waterway fleet contained in the plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty states that in principle, certain types of aid are incompatible with the common market.

In the interests of the sound working of the common market and taking into account the principles stated in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, derogations from the principle of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty enumerated in the third paragraph of that Article must be interpreted restrictively when any aid scheme or individual aid measure is being examined.\n\nIn particular, derogations can only by permitted if the Commission recognizes that the free play of market forces alone, in the absence of aid, is insufficient to prompt the aid's potential recipients to act to achieve the desired objectives.\n\nApplying these derogations in cases where they do not contribute to such an objective or where they are not essential to its achievement, would give unfair advantages to industries or firms in some Member States, who would find their financial position artificially bolstered and would affect trade between Member States and distort competition, without being justified by the common interest referred to in Article 92 (3).\n\nThe Belgian Government has been unable to furnish, and the Commission unable to discern, any reason for classing the aid in question under any of the categories of derogations listed in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.\n\nWith regard to the derogations under Article 92 (3) (b), it is evident that the aid in question is not designed to promote a project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy.\n\nThe Belgian Government has not even attempted to invoke such motives to justify the aid in question.\n\nWith regard to derogation under (c), the aid planned by the Belgian Government is not such that it would facilitate the development of certain economic areas within the meaning of this provision.\n\nFinally, as regards the derogation provided for under Article 92 (3) (c), for aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, it should be borne in mind that the aid in question, although facilitating the development of the Belgian fleet, does not facilitate the development of the inland waterway sector of Community\n\nlevel and affects trade within the Community in a manner contrary to the common interest given that sector's current overcapacity.\n\nTo be covered by this derogation, restructuring of the Belgian fleet to meet the requirements of the inland waterway market should only involve measures guaranteeing that this restructuring would be accompanied by a reduction in current overcapacity. No such guarantee is to be found in the present plan.\n\nFurthermore, it should be added that Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport envisages a common European approach to remedy the present overcapacity in the inland waterway sector, and that the Belgian plan is incompatible with the Regulation's provisions concerning the financing of scrapping.\n\nVI\n\nThe plan submitted by the Belgian authorities also included aid for cessation of activity for boatmen who are at least 55 years of age and renounce all activity, both direct and indirect, in the industry. This aid could be paid, until the legal retirement age, in the form of a monthly allowance with a ceiling of Bfrs 30 000 per month, minus any early retirement pension. This measure of a social nature, even taken in isolation, is admissible on the basis of the derogation in Article 92 (3) (c), of the EEC Treaty. In effect, the cessation of activity by some boatmen, who will no longer be competing within the industry, could be regarded as contributing to the general improvement of conditions in the sector at both national and Community level.\n\nThe aid in question would not adversely affect trading conditions in a manner contrary to the common interest. Moreover, the social measures envisaged by the Belgian Government are covered by the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 concerning the measures which Member States may take to make it easier for inland waterway carriers leaving the industry to obtain an early retirement pension or transfer to another economic activity.\n\nTo conclude, the aid for Belgian boatmen envisaged in the plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet is, except for aid to leaving the occupation, incompatible with the common market and cannot be implemented,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:""}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium shall not implement the plan to restructure the Belgian inland waterway fleet, this plan being incompatible with the common market under Article 92 of the EEC Treaty.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe aid for the cessation of activity of certain categories of Belgian boatmen, contained in the said plan, may nevertheless be regarded as compatible with the common market.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 96/59/EC
of 16 September 1996
on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls
(PCB/PCT)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 130s (1) thereof,
Having regard to the Commission proposal (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
(1) Whereas Council Directive 76/403/EEC of 6 April 1976 on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (4) brought about an approximation of the laws of the Member States in this field; whereas those rules have not proved sufficient; whereas the state of the art has evolved to a point where disposal conditions for PCBs can be improved; whereas that Directive should therefore be replaced by a new Directive;
(2) Whereas Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (5) underlines, the need for a periodic review of the whole problem with a view to moving gradually towards a complete ban on PCBs and PCTs;
(3) Whereas the safe disposal of non-recyclable and non-reusable waste is one of the objectives of the Council Resolution of 7 May 1990 on waste policy (6), as confirmed by the Fifth Action Programme on the Environment and Sustainable Development, the approach and general strategy of which were approved by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, in their Resolution of 1 February 1993 (7);
(4) Whereas in accordance with Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (8), appropriate measures must be taken to avoid the abandonment, dumping or uncontrolled disposal of waste, and the use of processes or methods which could harm the environment;
(5) Whereas in order to dispose of PCBs, because of the risks they present for the environment and for human health, general obligations concerning the controlled disposal of PCBs and the decontamination or disposal of equipment are necessary;
(6) Whereas such measures should be taken as soon as possible without prejudice to the Member States' international obligations, in particular those contained in PARCOM Decision 92/3 (9); whereas PCBs which are the subject of an inventory must be disposed of by the end of 2010 at the latest;
(7) Whereas the disposal of PCBs represents a transitional and temporary problem and some Member States which have no PCB disposal capacity face a force majeure situation; whereas the proximity principle should be interpreted in a flexible manner so as to permit European solidarity in this area; whereas, in addition, installations should be set up in the Community for the disposal, decontamination and storage of PCBs;
(8) Whereas Council Directive 75/439/EEC of 16 June 1975 on the disposal of waste oils (10) lays down 50 ppm as the maximum limit for the PCB or PCT content of regenerated oils or oils used as fuel;
(9) Whereas Council Directive 91/339/EEC of 18 June 1991, amending Directive 76/769/EEC for the eleventh time (11), prohibits or restricts the marketing of certain PCB substitutes, and whereas they too should therefore be disposed of completely;
(10) Whereas it is essential to know what quantities of PCBs exist in order to be able to match disposal capacity to needs; whereas it is therefore necessary to label equipment containing PCBs and to compile inventories of such equipment; whereas such inventories must be regularly updated;
(11) Whereas, bearing in mind the costs and technical difficulties entailed by an inventory of equipment slightly contaminated with PCBs, a simplified inventory should be used; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for equipment slightly contaminated by PCBs to be disposed of at the end of its useful life, bearing in mind the low risks it presents for the environment;
(12) Whereas the marketing of PCBs is prohibited, and whereas the separation of PCBs from other substances for their reuse and the topping up of transformers with PCBs should therefore be prohibited; whereas, however, on safety grounds, the maintenance of transformers may be continued in order to sustain the dielectric quality of the PCBs they contain;
(13) Whereas undertakings carrying out the disposal and/or decontamination of PCBs must obtain permits;
(14) Whereas the conditions for decontaminating equipment containing PCBs must be defined and whereas the equipment should be specifically labelled;
(15) Whereas certain technical tasks necessary for the implementation of this Directive should be carried out by the Commission, in accordance with the Committee procedure referred to in Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC;
(16) Whereas the number of PCB disposal and decontamination plants is small and their capacity limited and the disposal and/or decontamination of the PCBs inventoried must therefore be properly planned; whereas, moreover, outlines for the collection and subsequent disposal of non-inventoried equipment should be drawn up; whereas such outlines may, if necessary, make use of existing mechanisms concerning waste in general and need not take account of very minor quantities of PCBs which cannot be identified in practice,","{'title': 'Council Directive 96/59/EC of 16 September 1996 on the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls and polychlorinated terphenyls (PCB/PCT)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe purpose of this Directive is to approximate the laws of the Member States on the controlled disposal of PCBs, the decontamination or disposal of equipment containing PCBs and/or the disposal of used PCBs in order to eliminate them completely on the basis of the provisions of this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n\n(a) 'PCBs` means:\n\n- polychlorinated biphenyls,\n\n- polychlorinated terphenyls,\n\n- Monomethyl-tetrachlorodiphenyl methane, Monomethyl-dichloro-diphenyl methane, Monomethyl-dibromo-diphenyl methane,\n\n- any mixture containing any of the abovementioned substances in a total of more than 0,005 % by weight;\n\n(b) 'equipment containing PCBs` means any equipment containing PCBs or having contained PCBs (e.g. transformers, capacitors, receptacles containing residual stocks) which has not been decontaminated.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (1), and in particular Article 26(2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (2) and in particular Article 8 and Article 9(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2009/158/EC lays down the animal health conditions governing trade within the Union and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs and provides for model certificates for imports of these commodities.
(2) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption and provides for establishing specific rules and certification for transit.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (3) provides that the commodities covered by it are only to be imported into and transited through the Union from the third countries, territories, zones or compartments listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto. It also lays down the veterinary certification requirements for such commodities. The models of the veterinary certificates to accompany them are set out in Part 2 of that Annex.
(4) Belarus is currently not listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008. It has requested to be included in that list and has submitted information to the Commission concerning its compliance with the requirements of that Regulation.
(5) The Commission has taken a positive view of the information submitted by Belarus as regards the animal health conditions in that third country required for transit of eggs and egg products for human consumption through the Union. Therefore, it is appropriate to include that third country in the list set out in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008. However, pending the outcome of an inspection to be carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office in Belarus, the inclusion in the list should be limited to the transit of eggs and egg products for human consumption from that third country through the Union with the final destination in other third countries as the animal health risk from such introduction is very low. Such authorisation should be granted subject to the additional guarantee that the transit is carried out by road or by rail in lorries or railway wagons which have been sealed with a serially numbered seal.
(6) As this is intended to be an interim measure it should only remain in force for 18 months from the date of entry into force.
(7) The entry for Belarus should therefore be inserted in the list in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 and a new entry in the section ‘Additional guarantees’ in Part 2 of Annex I should be added.
(8) Experience has shown that certification of the animal health conditions of day-old chicks by the official veterinarian at the time of consignment for imports into the Union can pose practical problems to third country competent authorities.
(9) In order to take into account the production practices and certification procedures while ensuring that the necessary animal health conditions continue to be met, the model veterinary certificate for day-old chicks in Part 2 of Annex I should be modified.
(10) Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) It is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit Member States and industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification requirements provided for in this Regulation.

Whereas, in order to ensure proper administration of imports, a security should be required for applications for import licences and certain conditions should be laid down as regards applications for licences; whereas the fixed amounts should be staggered over the year and the procedure for awarding licences as well as their term of validity should be specified;
Whereas continuous access to the said fixed amounts should be ensured for all Community importers and the reduced duty rate should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question in all the Member States until the fixed amounts are exhausted; whereas the necessary measures should be taken to ensure efficient Community administration of those fixed amounts and, because of the risk of speculation in particular, access by importers to the said scheme should be subject to compliance with specific conditions; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (1), and in particular, Article 57(2) thereof;
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and other birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal health and under certain circumstances to human health and also to reduce the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) The highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from poultry and wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries. The likelihood of the spread of that virus to poultry flocks, in particular by wild birds, is increasing within the Community.
(3) Early detection systems and biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of avian influenza to poultry flocks are in place in the whole territory of the Netherlands.
(4) In its scientific opinions on avian influenza with respect to animal health and welfare aspects, the role of wild birds in the spread of avian influenza and on vaccination of poultry, captive birds and zoo birds against avian influenza, the Animal Health and Welfare Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommended that preventive vaccination can be considered, if a high risk of virus introduction is identified in particular in densely populated poultry areas.
(5) In addition, EFSA states that during an avian influenza epidemic there is always a significant risk that hobby and pet birds are hidden and constitute an ongoing risk of infection. This eventuality should be considered, and instead of the mass culling of such birds, a policy of increased surveillance and biosecurity may be recommended. Quarantine and preventive vaccination may also be considered as options for these types of birds. However, such a practice should not jeopardise the strict biosecurity and other measures that should be in force in such areas aimed at eradicating any introduction of the virus. In particular, preventive vaccination may be applied in flocks in which the general flock management systems that are used preclude birds being permanently housed indoors or sufficiently protected against contacts with wild birds.
(6) Commission Decision 2006/147/EC of 24 February 2006 on introducing preventive vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and related provisions for movements in the Netherlands (2) approved the plan for preventive vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, as submitted by the Netherlands to the Commission on 21 February 2006, and the amendments thereto, including the continuation of that plan until 31 July 2007 (‘the preventive vaccination plan’). It provides for certain measures to be applied in the Netherlands where preventive vaccination is carried out in certain poultry holdings at particular risk for the introduction of infection by that disease, including movement restrictions on vaccinated poultry.
(7) Given the experience gained with preventive vaccination under field conditions during the implementation of the preventive vaccination plan, it is appropriate to continue this pilot project in order to obtain further insight into the development and levels of bird immunity under a controlled setting.
(8) For that purpose, the Netherlands submitted on 29 June 2007 an updated preventive vaccination plan which is to be applied until 31 July 2009. The Commission examined that updated plan in collaboration with the Netherlands and considers that, subject to certain adaptations, it complies with the relevant Community animal health legislation. Accordingly, the updated preventive vaccination plan should be approved.
(9) For the purposes of such preventive vaccination, only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (3) or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (4) should be used.
(10) Where preventive vaccination is carried out in the Netherlands, monitoring of vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks and movement restrictions for vaccinated birds should be implemented in order to prevent the eventual virus circulation in vaccinated flocks, if exposed to field virus.
(11) In addition, certain restrictions should be placed on the movement of poultry and products thereof concerned by the preventive vaccination measures provided for in this Decision. Such restrictions should take into account the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (5), Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (6) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (7).
(12) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, Decision 2006/147/EC should be repealed.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '28.8.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 222/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 27 August 2007\non introducing preventive vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza and related provisions for movements in the Netherlands\n(notified under document number C(2007) 3977)\n(Only the Dutch text is authentic)\n(2007/590/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and other birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal health and under certain circumstances to human health and also to reduce the profitability of poultry farming.\n\n((2)) The highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from poultry and wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 provides for financial compensation to be paid to producer organisations which withdraw on certain conditions, the products listed in Annex I, (A) and (B) to that Regulation. The amount of such financial compensation should be reduced by standard values in the case of products intended for purposes other than human consumption.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2493/2001 of 19 December 2001 on the disposal of certain fishery products which have been withdrawn from the market (2) specifies the ways of disposing of the products withdrawn from the market. The value of such products should be fixed at a standard level for each of these modes of disposal, taking into account the average revenues which may be obtained from such disposal in the various Member States.

This body is the one in the Member State in which the producer organisation is recognised. The standard value deductible should therefore be the value applied in that Member State.
(4) The same method of calculation should be applied to advances on financial compensation as provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2509/2000.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 80(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) One element of Community maritime transport policy is to improve the quality of merchant shipping by making all economic operators act more responsibly.
(2) Dissuasive measures have already been adopted under Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements (4).
(3) On 9 October 2008, the Member States adopted a statement in which they unanimously recognised the importance of the application of the 1996 Protocol to the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims by all Member States.
(4) The obligation to have insurance should make it possible to ensure better protection for victims. It should also help to eliminate substandard ships and make it possible to reestablish competition between operators. Furthermore, in Resolution A.898(21), the International Maritime Organisation invited States to urge shipowners to be properly insured.
(5) Non compliance with the provisions of this Directive should be rectified. Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (recast) (5) already provides for the detention of ships in the case of absence of certificates which have to be carried on board. However, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility of expelling a ship which does not carry a certificate of insurance. The modalities of the expulsion should allow the situation to be rectified within a reasonable time period.
(6) Since the objectives of this Directive, namely the introduction and implementation of appropriate measures in the field of maritime transport policy, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 establishes a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals in order to ensure the transparency of the conditions for the production and marketing of beef and beef products. To that end, the Regulation requires the Member States to set up national bovine databases which will record the identity of the animal, all holdings on its territory and the movements of the animals. In addition, it imposes an obligation on keepers of animals to report to the competent authority, inter alia, all movements to and from the holding, along with the dates of these events, within a period fixed by the Member State of between three and seven days of the event occurring.
(2) The Regulation provides for the possibility for the Commission at the request of a Member State to extend that maximum period and to set up special rules applicable to different mountain areas, which was done by means of Commission Decision 2001/672/EC of 20 August 2001 laying down special rules applicable to movements of bovine animals when put out to summer grazing in mountain areas (2).
(3) Pursuant to recital 4 of Decision 2001/672/EC these special rules must result in a real simplification and foresee only what is absolutely necessary to guarantee the fully operational character of the national bovine databases.
(4) Decision 2001/672/EC applies to such movements during the period from 1 May to 15 October. Practical experience with the application of that Decision has shown that in some mountain areas movements to summer grazing areas start already in April. The scope of application of Decision 2001/672/EC should be amended accordingly to take account of that fact.
(5) Under certain conditions, animals, which are moved from different holdings to the same summer grazing mountain area, arrive there over a period of more than seven days. In order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens, time limits in Decision 2001/672/EC should therefore be adapted to take account of that practical fact without compromising traceability.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of changing the terms of authorisation of an additive further to an application from the holder of the authorisation.
(2) The use of the additive halofuginone hydrobromide 6 g/kg (Stenorol) belonging to the group of ‘Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances’ was authorised for 10 years for chickens for laying by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 (2). The authorisation was linked to the person responsible for putting the additive into circulation.
(3) The use of the additive salinomycin sodium 120 g/kg (Sacox 120) belonging to the group of ‘Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances’ was authorised for 10 years for rabbits for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 937/2001 (3). The authorisation was linked to the person responsible for putting the additive into circulation.
(4) The use of the additive salinomycin sodium 120 g/kg (Sacox 120 microGranulate) belonging to the group of ‘Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances’ was authorised for 10 years for chickens reared for laying by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1852/2003 (4). The authorisation was linked to the person responsible for putting the additive into circulation.
(5) The use of the additive salinomycin sodium 120 g/kg (Sacox 120 microGranulate) belonging to the group of ‘Coccidiostats and other medicinal substances’ was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1463/2004 (5). The authorisation was linked to the person responsible for putting the additive into circulation and replaced the previous authorisation of this additive which was not linked to any specific person.
(6) The holder of the authorisations, Hoechst Roussel Vet GmbH and Intervet International BV, have submitted applications pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 proposing to change the name of the person responsible for putting into circulation the additives referred to in recitals 2 to 5. With the application they have submitted data showing that the marketing rights for those additives have been transferred to Huvepharma NV with effect from 1 August 2005.
(7) Assigning the authorisation of an additive linked to a person responsible for putting it into circulation to another person, is based on a purely administrative procedure and did not entail a fresh assessment of the additives. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.
(8) To allow Huvepharma NV to exploit its ownership rights, it is necessary to change the name of the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Italian Government submitted to the Commission on 27 November 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the region of Umbria fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The plan includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other financial instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The Single Programming Document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(8) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(9) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(10) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this Single Programming Document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/566/EC: Commission Decision of 7 September 2001 approving the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Umbria in Italy (notified under document number C(2001) 2119)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Umbria in Italy eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Acetylisovaleryltylosin and methylprednisolone should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.
(7) In order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for cypermethrin.
(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/37/EC(4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

(2) As part of the Community's policy to assist its outermost regions, by Decisions 89/687/EEC(3), 91/314/EEC(4) and 91/315/EEC(5) the Council has set up programmes of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the French overseas departments (Poseidom), the Canary Islands (Poseican) and Madeira and the Azores (Poseima) respectively, which outline the measures to be applied taking account of the special characteristics of and constraints on those regions.
(3) Article 299(2) of the Treaty recognises the particular handicaps affecting the economic and social situation of the outermost regions, made worse by their remoteness and insularity. The same also applies to the fishing industry.
(4) The regions concerned are facing specific development problems, and in particular additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain products as a result of their remoteness.
(5) With a view to maintaining the competitiveness of certain fishery products compared with that of similar products from other Community regions, the Community introduced measures in 1992 and 1993 to compensate for such additional costs in the fisheries sector. Those measures were then followed in 1994 and in the period 1995 to 1997 by the adoption of Regulations (EC) No 1503/94(6) and (EC) No 2337/95(7) and in the period 1998 to 2002 by the adoption of Regulations (EC) No 1587/98(8) and (EC) No 579/2002(9). From 2003 provision needs to be made for continuation of the scheme for offsetting the additional costs for certain fishery products as regards processing and marketing and, accordingly, measures should be adopted so that these measures may continue.
(6) The non-industrial and inshore fishing industry is of social and economic importance in the outermost regions of the European Union.
(7) For the sake of sound management of stocks fishing efforts must be rationalised, in particular in the light of the research of a high technical standard conducted in this area by various scientific institutions in the outermost regions.
(8) The Community rules on the conservation and management of stocks must be observed in those regions, and in particular, in the case of the French department of Guiana, the rule prohibiting fishing for shrimp at a depth of less than 30 metres.
(9) In order to promote the economic development of the outermost regions concerned, the Member States should be able to adjust the quantities and the Commission to adjust the amounts and quantities set for the various species from the same outermost region or between outermost regions of the same Member State, to take account of changes in marketing conditions and species' characteristics.
(10) Where adjustment between species or within regions belonging to the same Member State has not led to full utilisation of the amounts available, the Commission should be able to adjust the amounts and quantities set for the various species between outermost regions of different Member States. In that event, adjustment should be without prejudice to the scale for allocating amounts available under this Regulation in subsequent years.
(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(10),","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EC) No 2328/2003 of 22 December 2003 introducing a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and Réunion, as a result of those regions' remoteness"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPurpose\n\nThis Regulation introduces a scheme to compensate for the additional costs incurred in the marketing of certain fishery products listed in Annexes I to V from the Azores, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the French departments of Guiana and Réunion (hereinafter referred to as ""the compensation"") as a result of those regions\' remoteness.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nRecipients\n\nThe recipients of the compensation shall be the producers, the owners or operators of vessels registered in the ports of the regions referred to in Article 1 and operating therein or associations of such operators, and the operators in the processing and marketing sector or associations of such operators, who incur the additional costs in marketing the products concerned as a result of the remoteness of those regions.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nAzores\n\nIn the case of the Azores, the compensation shall be payable for the fishery products listed in Annex I.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas there has been an outbreak of classical swine fever in certain parts of the Community territory; whereas, despite the measures applied, the disease is persisting and spreading in some of those areas;
Whereas in the Federal Republic of Germany classical swine fever is widespread in certain zones;
Whereas, as a result, trade in fresh pigmeat originating in some of those areas constitutes a risk of spreading the disease; whereas some Member States have adopted protective measures in this respect;
Whereas all other Member States should therefore adopt protective measures and apply them for an appropriate period;
Whereas, in the absence of any concurring opinion from the Standing Veterinary Committee, the Commission was unable to adopt the measures it had envisaged on this matter under the procedure provided for in Article 8 of Directive 72/461/EEC,","{'title': '84/10/EEC: Council Decision of 10 January 1984 concerning certain protective measures against classical swine fever as regards fresh pigmeat', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(IV/29.688 - The London Grain Futures Market)

(87/45/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Article 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the notification and application for negative clearance submitted on 22 August 1978 relating to the articles of association and the regulations of the London Grain Futures Market,
Having regard to the summary of the notification published (2) pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
I. FACTS
(1) The London Grain Futures Market (LGFM) was set up and is run under the auspices of the Grain and Feed Trade Association (GAFTA) and is one of many commodity markets established in London. The commodity markets are self-regulatory organizations run by committees of management, aided by secretariats and using powers given to them by their members in market rule books. The LGFM Committee consists of 13 members of whom four are elected by the members of the LGFM, seven are nominated by the Council of GAFTA (which is in turn largely elected from among the members of GAFTA), and two are nominated annually by the UK Agricultural Supply Trade Association Limited. Although the markets are self-regulating, there is an element of supervision by the Bank of England and, increasingly, supervision of the members by the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers Limited (AFBD).
(2) The object of the LGFM is to set up and administer a terminal market in London for grain. A terminal market, or a futures market, provides organized facilities for concluding contracts for the purchase and sale of a commodity to be delivered at named future dates. Futures markets have been developed primarily to enable persons involved in commodity trading to protect themselves from the risks of adverse price movements.
(3) The LGFM provides a market floor for trading and price-making, determines various technical questions, such as allowable delivery months and standard contract terms, and procures the provision of clearing and settlement facilities. Trading is done on the floor of the market where dealers face each other in a ring, making bids and offers through the system known as 'open outcry'.
(4) The International Futures Markets in London are among the principal markets used in international commodity merchandising and they contribute to the stability and smooth operation of world trade and to world pricing mechanisms. The relative size of the LGFM compared with its most important competitors is shown below:

(1) One tonne contract.
(2) 20 tonnes contract.
(3) 5 000 bushels contract (one tonne = 36,7437 bushels).
(5) There are currently two contracts being traded on the LGFM:
(a) The barley contract which is for barley of EEC origin, of a standard and quality specified in detail in Regulation 21 of the Regulations of the LGFM, for delivery to the buyer's lorry in bulk from a store registered by the Committee of the LGFM on the mainland of Great Britain;
(b) A wheat contract for grade B wheat of EEC origin, of a standard and quality specified in detail in Regulations 21b of the Regulations of the LGFM, for delivery to the buyer's lorry in bulk from a store registered by the Committee on the mainland of Great Britain.
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, trading is for delivery in the months of September, November, January, March and May for both barley and wheat and also for July in the case of wheat.
(6) All contracts traded on the LGFM must be registered with the clearing house of GAFTA. The clearing house was set up by GAFTA for the purpose of regulating transactions in futures contracts and its principal purpose is to facilitate the transmission of documents, payments, settlements, notices and other relevant matters between members on the terms of the Regulations of the LGFM. Subject to certain conditions set out in the Articles of GAFTA, GAFTA operates a guarantee system for the due fulfilment of contracts made by members of the LGFM in whose name such contracts are registered.
(7) There are two classes of membership of the LGFM. The first class consists of full members who are allowed to trade on the floor of the market. The Regulations provide that full membership shall be limited to 58 members. The second class of member consists of associate members. Their number is not limited.
(8) The criteria specified in the Regulations for full members require an applicant for membership to meet certain financial requirements. To become a full member the applicant must satisfy the Committee that it is actively interested in the trading of grain and has a genuine place of business, as approved by the Committee.
(9) Associate members must have a genuine place of business, as approved by the Committee, within a Member State of the EEC.
(10) All members must be members of GAFTA, but any person who is engaged (or who has been engaged) in the grain trade and any corporation wheresoever situated, engaged in the grain trade, is eligible for membership of GAFTA and there may be up to 1 000 members of GAFTA at any one time, which number may be increased.
(11) A member may generally sell his membership certificate provided that the purchaser is elected in accordance with the Regulations of the LGFM.
(12) The Committee is now required to give reasons when it takes decisions affecting the members' rights of membership. An appeal procedure applies if the Committee refuses an application for membership, refuses to grant permission for the sale of a membership certificate, suspends a member for more than seven days, expels a member or if a member is deemed to have resigned upon ceasing to meet the criteria for his class of membership. In these cases, if the candidate or member is dissatisfied with the Committee's decision, that candidate or member may ask the Committee to reconsider its decision, making such representations and supplying such information as it considers relevant. (13) The regulations require that a member must generally be a member of the Association of Futures Brokers and Dealers Limited (AFBD). However, this requirement is not mandatory for all members. A member is excused from this obligation if he is (a) not a full member and has no place of business in the UK, or (b) engages in business exclusively on his own account or on behalf of a related company, or (c) falls within a category of member which is excused membership of the AFBD by the AFBD itself. The AFBD is one of seven self-regulatory organizations (SROs) which it is expected will be recognized by the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), which was set up in anticipation of the Financial Services Act, which stipulates that the only persons allowed to carry on investment business in the UK are 'authorized persons' or certain 'exempted persons'. Members of the LGFM will be so authorized by virtue of being members of the AFBD. In order to become a member of the AFBD, applicants have to fulfil certain qualitative criteria which reflect the AFBD's primary object, i. e. to promote and maintain a system of supervision of the conduct of business by commodity, financial and other futures brokers and dealers, particularly with a view to the protection of the interests of their clients. These criteria relate to the suitability of members' financial and business standing, and eligibility in other respects such as reliability, training, experience and financial resources.
(14) The regulations of the LGFM provide that 'a' charge of commission shall be made by every member in respect of every London grain futures transaction affected for another party, whether or not a member, but the rates of commission are freely negotiable. Both transactions of a 'straddle' may be executed for one commission provided that both are closed simultaneously (a 'straddle' arises where a purchase is made under one contract against a simultaneous sale under another contract for the same kind of grain for a different delivery month or for a different kind of grain for the same or a different delivery month).
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
(15) The notified regulations of the LGFM are to be considered as agreements within the meaning of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty.
(16) The regulations of the LGFM take into account the representations of the Commission in relation to various other terminal markets in London. The Commission has already granted negative clearance in respect of the rules of these associations by Decisions 85/563/EEC (1) (sugar), 85/564/EEC (2) (cocoa), 85/565/EEC (3) (coffee) and 85/566/EEC (4) (rubber).
(17) The regulations as originally notified specified the minimum net rates of commission which were chargeable in respect of grain futures. The rules specified rates of commission which varied according to the nature of the client. The rates were higher for associate members than for full members, and were still higher for non-members. A special rate could be obtained where a 'day trade' took place, where the buying and selling trade took place on the same day and was closed out on that day. The regulations prohibited any form of deductions from the minimum commissions, and any arrangement effecting or intended to effect, directly or indirectly, a deduction from the minimum rates was deemed to be a violation of the regulations.
(18) The Commission considered that the above system of specified minimum commission rates was a form of price-fixing that violated Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty. The LGFM was requested to abandon the system of fixed minimum rates. The system has now been completely abolished and references to the system in the regulations have been deleted. The regulations no longer contain any form of minimum commission but simply provide that 'a charge' of commission must be made by every member in respect of every contract for third parties (whether or not that third party is a member). Complete freedom exists to negotiate the actual commission rates and accordingly the Commission believes that this obligation is not appreciably restrictive of competition.
(19) Furthermore, as a result of representations by the Commission, amendments have been made to the regulations concerning membership so that membership is now open and that the criteria by which applications for membership are judged are objective. The Committee is required to give reasons when it takes decisions affecting the members' rights of membership. To protect the rights of actual or potential members, an appeal procedure has been introduced.
(20) The publications in the Official Journal of the European Communities, pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17, did not elicit any representations.
(21) The articles of association of GAFTA and the regulations of the LGFM as outlined above do not contain clauses which constitute appreciable restrictions on competition within the common market. Therefore the Commission, on the basis of the facts in its possession, has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1). Consequently, the Commission is able to issue a negative clearance pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation No 17,","{'title': '87/45/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 December 1986 relating to a proceeding under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/29.688 - The London Grain Futures Market) (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nOn the basis of the facts in its possession the Commission has no grounds for action under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the articles of association and the regulations of the London Grain Futures Market as notified on 22 August 1978.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the London Grain Futures Market, whose registered office is at Baltic Exchange Chambers, 24/28 St Mary Axe, London EC 3A 8EP, United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 December 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPeter SUTHERLAND\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No 13, 21. 2. 1962, p. 204/62.\n\n(2) OJ No C 251, 8. 10. 1986, p. 5.\n\n(1) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 25.\n\n(2) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 28.\n\n(3) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 31.\n\n(4) OJ No L 369, 31. 12. 1985, p. 34.'}]}"

of 13 December 2004
amending Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of cotton-type bedlinen originating in India
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’),
Having regard to Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 of 13 January 2004 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of cotton-type bedlinen originating in India (2),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 74/2004, the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports into the Community of cotton-type bedlinen falling within CN codes ex 6302 21 00 (TARIC codes 6302210081, 6302210089), ex 6302 22 90 (TARIC code 6302229019), ex 6302 31 10 (TARIC code 6302311090), ex 6302 31 90 (TARIC code 6302319090) and ex 6302 32 90 (TARIC code 6302329019), originating in India. Given the large number of cooperating parties, a sample of Indian exporting producers was selected and individual duty rates ranging from 4,4 % to 10,4 % were imposed on the companies included in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample were attributed a duty rate of 7,6 %. A duty rate of 10,4 % was imposed on companies which either did not make themselves known or did not cooperate with the investigation.
(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 stipulates that where any new exporting producer in India provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that it did not export to the Community the products described in Article 1(1) during the investigation period (1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002) (the ‘first criterion’) and it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in India which are subject to the anti-subsidy measures imposed by that Regulation (the ‘second criterion’), and it has actually exported to the Community the products concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community (the ‘third criterion’), then Article 1(3) of that Regulation can be amended by granting the new exporting producer the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample, i.e. 7,6 %.
B.   NEW EXPORTERS/PRODUCERS' REQUESTS
(3) Twenty-four Indian companies have applied not to be treated differently from the companies which cooperated in the original investigation but were not included in the sample (‘newcomer status’).
(4) Two Indian companies requesting the newcomer status did not provide a questionnaire reply. It was therefore not possible to verify whether these companies fulfilled the criteria set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004, and their request had to be rejected.
(5) Two requests for newcomer status were received too late and therefore no conclusion could be reached on these requests by the date of adoption of this Regulation.
(6) The remaining twenty companies replied to the questionnaire intended to verify that the companies complied with the provisions of Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004.
(7) The evidence provided by thirteen of the abovementioned Indian exporters/producers is considered sufficient to grant these new companies the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 7,6 %) and therefore to add these thirteen Indian companies to the list in the Annex (the ‘Annex’) of Council Regulation (EC) No 74/2004.
(8) As far as the remaining seven Indian exporters/producers are concerned, two of them were related to companies subject to the current countervailing measures, three exported the product concerned to the Community during the original investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002), one could not provide any invoice or evidence that it had actually exported to the Community the product concerned after the original investigation period or that it had entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export the product concerned to the Community.
(9) Finally, it is noted that one request could not be dealt with in the present context, since the evidence provided by the applicant company needs further examination.
(10) Under these circumstances, it was considered that for the six companies referred to in recital (8), at least one of the criteria set out in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 was not fulfilled. Therefore, their claim had to be rejected.
(11) Companies for which the newcomer status was not accepted were informed of the reasons of that decision and given an opportunity to make their views known in writing.
(12) The two companies related to companies subject to the current countervailing measures claimed in one case that their related company did not exist anymore, and in the second case that they were indeed expecting to be subject to the same duty rate as their related company.
(13) It was considered in the first case that the fact that the related company did not exist anymore was indeed a significant element in the current procedure, and that in this case it could not be considered that the newcomer was not respecting the second criterion. It was therefore decided that this company should also be subject to the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 7,6 %) and therefore be added to the list in the Annex.
(14) In the second case, where the applicant company is related to a company under measures, it was found that this should not automatically deprive the company of being subject to the weighted average duty margin for cooperating companies not included in the sample. Indeed, it was examined whether both related companies, if considered together, would have been selected in the sample of exporting producers according to the selection criteria specified in recital (11) of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004. Since this appeared not to be the case, the relationship between both companies does not affect the findings of the above mentioned Regulation. On these grounds, and given the Commission’s consistent practice to consider all related companies as one entity subject to the same duty, it was decided that this company should also be subject to the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 7,6 %) and therefore be added to the list in the Annex.
(15) All arguments and submissions made by interested parties were analysed and duly taken into account when warranted,","{'header': '17.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 370/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2143/2004\nof 13 December 2004\namending Regulation (EC) No 74/2004 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of cotton-type bedlinen originating in India', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe following companies shall be added to the list of exporters /producers from India listed in the Annex of Regulation (EC) No 74/2004:\n‘Alps Industries Ltd\nGhaziabad\nAmbaji Marketing Pvt.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 of 15 December 1994 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 4(8) and Article 7(2) thereof,
Whereas Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 states that without prejudice to Article 4(8) and unless the substances are intended for destruction by a technology approved by the Parties, for feedstock use in the manufacture of other chemicals or for quarantine and pre-shipment, the release for free circulation in the Community of controlled substances imported from third countries shall be subject to quantitative limits;
Whereas the quantitative limits for the release into free circulation in the Community of controlled substances are set out in Annex II and Article 4(8) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94; whereas these limits may be modified pursuant to Article 7(3);
Whereas any modification of these quantitative limits may not lead to Community consumption of controlled substances exceeding the quantitative limits established according to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer;
Whereas Article 4(8) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 defines the total calculated level of hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which producers and importers may place on the market or use for their own account in the period 1 January to 31 December 1995 and in each 12-month period thereafter; whereas this corresponds to a quantity of 8 079 ODP tonnes;
Whereas the Commission is required, under Article 4(8), in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 16, to assign a quota to each producer or importer when the total quantity of HCFCs which producers and importers place on the market or use for their own account reaches 80 % of the quantitative limit established or at the latest on 1 January 2000, whichever comes first;
Whereas the 80 % threshold has been reached in the year 1997; whereas it is likely that this will also be the case in 1998 making it necessary to assign placing on the market quotas for HCFCs for 1999;
Whereas the Commission is required under Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 3093/94 to allocate quotas for controlled substances to undertakings each year in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 16;
Whereas the Commission has published a notice to importers in the European Community of controlled substances that deplete the ozone layer (2) and has thereby received applications for import quotas;
Whereas the applications for import quotas of the chlorofluorocarbons 11, 12, 113, 114 and 115 and halons exceed the import quotas available under Article 7(2); therefore the Commission cannot satisfy the applications;
Whereas some of the applications from the producers of ODS in the Community have been made for specific contingency purposes of possible breakdown of production, technical failure and non-availability of the substances in the Community; whereas requests by a producer to import under a contingency quota can only be considered following interruption to normal supply and non-availability of the substances within the Community;
Whereas the allocation of individual quotas to producers and importers is based on the principles of continuity, equality and proportionality; whereas, in establishing quotas, the Commission has been guided by the need to reduce further the production, import and use of substances which damage the ozone layer while interfering in the market as little as possible;
Whereas for methyl bromide the import quotas are allocated to the primary importers, considered by the Commission to be the importers who deal directly by way of invoicing with the producers outside the Community; whereas a reserve of 100,6 ODP tonnes of methyl bromide is retained for allocation during 1999 in accordance with the Article 16 procedure;
Whereas it is appropriate to retain part of the total HCFC placing on the market quota for allocation to importers in the Community who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas, in 1998, the level of imports is 4 % of the total quota available; whereas it is appropriate in 1999 to retain 4 % of the total quota for allocation to importers who are not engaged in the production of HCFCs; whereas this corresponds to a quantity of 323 ODP tonnes;
Whereas the HCFC placing on the market quota for each producer in the Community in 1999 shall reflect the market share which that producer reached in 1996, calculated in ODP tonnes; whereas it is appropriate to retain 1996 as a base-year; whereas it is considered appropriate to allocate the total available HCFC quantity of 7 756 ODP tonnes between producers without leaving a reserve;
Whereas import licences shall be issued by the Commission in accordance with Article 6 of the aforesaid Regulation, after verification of compliance by the importer with Articles 7, 8 and 12;

of 11 May 2001
amending the Annexes to Council Directive 90/642/EEC on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/82/EC(2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 2000/42/EC(3) fixed maximum residue levels (MRLs) in relation to pesticide/food combinations that were left open in Council Directives 94/29/EC(4), 94/30/EC(5), 95/38/EC(6), 95/39/EC(7), 96/32/EC(8), 96/33/EC(9) and Commission Directive 98/82/EC(10). The above entries in the Annexes to the Directives were left ""open"", or were fixed on a temporary basis, because there was insufficient data available, at the dates of their adoption, to justify the fixing of maximum residue limits at Community level by 1 July 2000. The objective of fixing the said deadline was to provide interested parties with sufficient time to provide the necessary data enabling, where appropriate and justified, the adoption of maximum residue levels at Community level above the lower limit of analytical determination. In the period preceding the expiry of the deadline, the available data was evaluated and in some cases not considered adequate to justify fixing maximum residue levels higher than the limit of analytical determination.
(2) Following publication of Directive 2000/42/EC, the Commission received requests, supported by further data, to review the levels at which MRLs for certain pesticide/food combinations had been fixed by virtue of Directive 2000/42/EC. The applications and data were reviewed, and for some combinations, the data was sufficient to justify the fixing of an MRL above the lower limit of analytical determination. For other combinations the information available remains inadequate and it is appropriate to fix maximum residue levels at the lower limit of analytical determination. For other combinations the information now available is sufficient to demonstrate that the setting of a maximum residue level above the lower limit of analytical determination may give rise to an unacceptable acute or chronic exposure of the consumer to the residues. In such cases, the maximum residue levels should remain fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(3) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides arising from their uses in plant protection and, where applicable, in veterinary medicine has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation(11) and it has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed in this Directive do not give rise to an exceeding of the acceptable daily intakes.
(4) The acute exposure of consumers to these pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It has been calculated that the maximum residue levels fixed for open positions in the present Directive do not give rise to acute toxic effects.
(5) The Community's trading partners will be consulted about the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels will be considered.
(6) The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account. The methodology described by the World Health Organisation, referred to above, as applied by rapporteur Member States, checked and evaluated by the Commission in the framework of the Standing Committee on Plant Health, is in agreement with the guidance given by the Scientifc Committee of Plants(12).

initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011 on imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of bicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, and making such imports subject to registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’) and in particular Articles 13(3) and 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee in accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST
(1) The European Commission (‧the Commission‧) has received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China and to make imports of bicycles consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, subject to registration.
(2) The request was lodged on 14 August 2012 by the European Bicycle Manufacturers Association (EBMA) on behalf of In Cycles – Montagem e Comercio de Bicicletas, Ldo, SC. EUROSPORT DHS S.A. and MAXCOM Ltd, three Union producers of bicycles.
B.   PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is bicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles, but excluding unicycles), not motorised, currently falling within CN codes 8712 00 30 and ex 8712 00 70 (TARIC code 8712007090) and originating in the People’s Republic of China (‧the product concerned‧).
(4) The product under investigation is the same as that defined in the previous recital, but consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, currently falling within the same CN codes as the product concerned (‧the product under investigation‧).
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 990/2011 (2) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China following an expiry review pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of the measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1524/2000 (3) and amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/2005 (4).
D.   GROUNDS
(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of bicycles originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia and by means of assembly operations of certain bicycle parts from the People’s Republic of China in accordance with Art 13.2 of the basic Regulation via Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.
(7) The prima facie evidence submitted is as follows:
(8) The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the Union has taken place following the increase of the anti-dumping duty on the product concerned imposed by Council Regulation (EC) 1095/2005, without sufficient due cause or justification for such a change other than the imposition of the duty.
(9) This change appears to stem from the transhipment of bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China via Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia to the Union and from assembly operations in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia.
(10) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of the product under investigation appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that imports of the product under investigation are made at prices below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.
(11) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of the product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.
(12) Should circumvention practices via Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment and assembly operations be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may also cover these practices.
E.   PROCEDURE
(13) In light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(a)   Questionnaires
(14) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in the People's Republic of China, to the known importers and to the known associations of importers in the Union and to the authorities of the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Union industry.
(15) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time-limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation, and request a questionnaire within the time-limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time-limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(16) The authorities of the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(17) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Exemption of registration of imports or measures
(18) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(19) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Union, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia of bicycles and other cycles (including delivery tricycles, but excluding unicycles), not motorised, that can show that they are not related (5) to any producer subject to the measures (6) and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time-limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.
F.   REGISTRATION
(20) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation shall be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied from the date on which registration of such imports consigned from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia was imposed.
G.   TIME-LIMITS
(21) In the interest of sound administration, time-limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— producers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
(22) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time-limits laid down in Article 3 of this Regulation.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(23) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time-limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(24) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.
(25) If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION
(26) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.
J.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(27) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (7).
K.   HEARING OFFICER
(28) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time-limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested parties' rights of defence are being fully exercised.
(29) A request for a hearing with the Hearing Officer should be made in writing and should specify the reasons for the request. The Hearing Officer will also provide opportunities for a hearing involving parties to take place which would allow different views to be presented and rebuttal arguments offered.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1)b of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(p) and listed in Part XVI of Annex I to that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these goods are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) In accordance with the second paragraph, subparagraph (a) of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed for a period of the same duration as that for which refunds are fixed for the same products exported unprocessed.
(4) Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lays down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(6) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.
(7) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(8) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.

The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n\n((6)) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the agricultural markets to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.\n\n((7)) Article 100(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n\n((8)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Part XVI of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, and exported in the form of goods listed in Part IV of Annex XX to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 5 June 2009.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 5 June 2009 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n1\n)\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\nex\xa00402\xa010\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\xa0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a)\non exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n—\n—\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n21,00\n21,00\nex\xa00402\xa021\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\xa0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a)\nwhere goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n36,15\n36,15\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n31,00\n31,00\nex\xa00405\xa010\nButter, with a fat content by weight of 82\xa0% (PG 6):\n(a)\nwhere goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n65,00\n65,00\n(b)\non exportation of goods of CN code 2106\xa090\xa098  containing 40\xa0% or more by weight of milk fat\n66,52\n66,52\n(c)\non exportation of other goods\n65,00\n65,00\n(\n1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to\n(a)\nthird countries: Andorra, the Holy See (Vatican City State), Liechtenstein, the United States of America and the goods listed in Tables I and II of Protocol 2 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation.\n(b)\nterritories of EU Member States not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Ceuta, Melilla, the Communes of Livigno and Campione d’Italia, Heligoland, Greenland, the Faeroe Islands and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control.\n(c)\nEuropean territories for whose external relations a Member State is responsible and not forming part of the customs territory of the Community: Gibraltar.\n(d)\nthe destinations referred to in Article 36(1), Article 44(1) and Article 45(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (\nOJ L 102, 17.4.1999, p. 11\n).'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. Terbuthylazine is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (4) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included terbuthylazine.
(3) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1095/2007 of 20 September 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 laying down further detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (6) the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within two months from entry into force of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (7) was adopted on the non-inclusion of terbuthylazine.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I.
(5) The application was submitted to the United Kingdom, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) The United Kingdom evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 3 February 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on terbuthylazine to the Commission on 20 December 2010 (8). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for terbuthylazine.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing terbuthylazine may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve terbuthylazine in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that terbuthylazine should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(11) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing terbuthylazine. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(12) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (9) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (10) should be amended accordingly.
(14) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of terbuthylazine and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning terbuthylazine in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2226/88 of 19 July 1988 fixing standard qualities for certain cereals and categories of flour, groats and meal and the rules for fixing the threshold prices of these categories of products (2), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, has been repealed; whereas the standard qualities for cereals for which intervention is not applicable and, as regards the products listed in Article 1 (1) (c), with the exception of malt, the standard qualities and their  threshold prices are to be fixed by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92;
Whereas the threshold prices for oats and flour, groats and meal must correspond to specified standard qualities; whereas those qualities should correspond as far as possible to the average qualities of those products in the Community;
Whereas the threshold prices for flour, groats and meal should be so fixed as to enable the target prices for the basic cereals to be attained and protection of the processing industry to be ensured;
Whereas those objectives may be attained by fixing a threshold price which allows for the cost of manufacturing those products and an adequate level of protection for the processing industry;
Whereas manufacturing costs may be determined by adding to the value of the cereal an amount representing the milling margin and by subtracting from the total thus obtained, where appropriate, a fixed amount for the value of meal or flour of inferior  quality and other residues of milling;
Whereas, however, when fixing the threshold price for groats and meal of wheat, a fixed ratio representing the relationship between the price of wheat flour and the prices of those products on Community market should be taken as a basis;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 911/2001(2), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Citrus fruit are among the products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 for which standards must be adopted. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 of 10 April 1989 laying down quality standards for carrots, citrus fruit and dessert apples and pears and amending Commission Regulation No 58(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1619/2001(4), has been amended frequently and can no longer ensure legal clarity.
(2) The rules in question should therefore be recast and Regulation (EEC) No 920/89 deleted. To that end and in the interests of preserving transparency on the world market, account should be taken of the standard for citrus fruit recommended by the Working Party on Standardisation of Perishable Produce and Quality Development of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE).
(3) Application of this standard should remove products of unsatisfactory quality from the market, bring production into line with consumer requirements and facilitate trade based on fair competition, thereby helping to improve profitability.
(4) The standards are applicable at all marketing stages. Long-distance transport, storage over a certain period and the various processes the products undergo may cause certain deterioration owing to the biological development of the products or their relatively perishable nature. Account should be taken of such deterioration when applying the standard at the marketing stages following dispatch. As products in the ""Extra"" class have to be particularly carefully sorted and packaged, only lack of freshness and turgidity is to be taken into account in their case.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1799/2001 of 12 September 2001 laying down the marketing standard for citrus fruit', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe marketing standard for the following products shall be as set out in the Annex:\n\n- sweet oranges, falling within CN code ex 0805 10,\n\n- mandarins (including tangerines and satsumas), clementines, wilkings and similar citrus hybrids, falling within CN code 0805 20,\n\n- lemons, falling within CN code 0805 30 10.\n\nThis standard shall apply at all marketing stages, under the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2200/96.\n\nHowever, at stages following dispatch, the products may show in relation to the provisions of the standard:\n\n- a slight lack of freshness and turgidity,\n\n- for products graded in classes other than the ""Extra"" class, slight deteriorations due to their development and their tendency to perish.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 920/89 is repealed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply from the first day of the third month following its entry into force.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 12 September 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 129, 11.5.2001, p. 3.\n\n(3) OJ L 97, 11.4.1989, p. 19.\n\n(4) OJ L 215, 9.8.2001, p. 3.\n\nANNEX\n\nSTANDARD FOR CITRUS FRUIT\n\nI. DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\n\nThis standard applies to the following fruit, classified as ""citrus fruit"", to be supplied fresh to the consumer, citrus fruit for industrial processing being excluded:\n\n- lemons of varieties (cultivars) grown from the species Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f.,\n\n- mandarins of varieties (cultivars) grown from the species Citrus reticulata Blanco, including satsumas (Citrus unshiu Marcow.), clementines (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.), common mandarins (Citrus deliciosa Ten.) and tangerines (Citrus tangerina Hort. ex Tan.) grown from these species and its hybrids, hereinafter called ""mandarins"",\n\n- oranges of varieties (cultivars) grown from the species Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb.\n\nII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING QUALITY\n\nThe purpose of the standard is to define the quality requirements of the citrus fruit after preparation and packaging.\n\nA. Minimum requirements\n\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the citrus fruit must be:\n\n- intact,\n\n- free of bruising and/or extensive healed over cuts,\n\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n\n- clean practically free of any visible foreign matter,\n\n- practically free from pests,\n\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n\n- free of signs of internal shrivelling,\n\n- free of damage caused by low temperature or frost,\n\n- free of all abnormal external moisture,\n\n- free of any foreign smell and/or taste.\n\nThe citrus fruit must have been carefully picked and have reached an appropriate degree of development and ripeness account being taken of criteria proper to the variety, the time of picking and the growing area.\n\nThe development and state of ripeness of the citrus fruit must be such as to enable them:\n\n- to withstand transport and handling, and\n\n- to arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination.\n\nCitrus fruit meeting this ripeness requirement may be ""degreened"". This treatment is permitted only if the other natural organoleptic characteristics are not modified. It shall be carried out in the manner prescribed by the administrative authorities in each Member State and under their supervision.\n\nB. Maturity requirements\n\nMaturity of citrus fruit is defined by the following parameters specified for each specie below:\n\n1. Minimum juice content\n\n2. Colouring\n\nThe degree of colouring shall be such that, following normal development the citrus fruit reach the colour typical of the variety at their destination point.\n\n(i) Lemons\n\n- Minimum juice content:\n\n>TABLE>\n\n- Colouring: must be typical of the variety. However fruits with a green (but not dark green) colour are allowed provided they satisfy the minimum requirements as to juice content.\n\n(ii) Mandarins\n\n- Minimum juice content:\n\n>TABLE>\n\n- Colouring: must be typical of the variety on at least one third of the surface of the fruit.\n\n(iii) Oranges\n\n- Minimum juice content:\n\n>TABLE>\n\n- Colouring: must be typical of the variety. However, fruits with light green colour are allowed, provided it does not exceed one fifth of the total surface of the fruit.\n\nC. Classification\n\nCitrus fruit are classified in three classes defined below:\n\n(i) ""Extra"" Class\n\nCitrus fruit in this class must be of superior quality. In shape, external appearance, development and colouring they must be characteristic of the variety and/or commercial type.\n\nThey must be free from defects with the exception of very slight superficial defects, provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package.\n\n(ii) Class I\n\nCitrus fruit in this class must be of good quality. They must be characteristic of the variety and/or commercial type.\n\nThe following slight defects, however, may be allowed provided these do not affect the general appearance of the produce, the quality, the keeping quality and presentation in the package:\n\n- slight defect in shape,\n\n- slight defect in colouring,\n\n- slight skin defects occurring during the formation of the fruit, such as silver scurfs, russets, etc.,\n\n- slight healed defects due to a mechanical cause such as hail damage, rubbing, damage from handling, etc.\n\n(iii) Class II\n\nThis class includes citrus fruit which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\n\nThe following defects may be allowed, provided the citrus fruit retain their essential characteristics as regards the quality, the keeping quality and presentation:\n\n- defect in shape,\n\n- defect in colouring,\n\n- rough skin,\n\n- skin defects occurring during the formation of the fruit, such as silver scurfs, russets, etc.,\n\n- healed defects due to a mechanical cause such as hail damage, rubbing, damage from handling, etc.,\n\n- superficial healed skin alterations,\n\n- slight and partial detachment of the pericarp for oranges (which is allowed for mandarins).\n\nIII. PROVISIONS CONCERNING SIZING\n\nSize is determined by the maximum diameter of the equatorial section of the fruit.\n\nA. Minimum size\n\nFruits of less than the following minimum sizes are excluded:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nB. Size scales\n\nThe scales of sizes are as follows:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nC. Uniformity\n\nUniformity in size is achieved by the abovementioned size scales, unless otherwise stated as follows:\n\n(i) For fruit arranged in regular layers in the package the maximum difference between the smallest and the largest fruit must not exceed the following maxima:\n\n>TABLE>\n\n(ii) For fruit not arranged in regular layers in packages and fruit in individual packages for direct sale to the consumer made up by number of fruit, the difference between the smallest and the largest fruit in the same package must not exceed the range of the appropriate size grade in the size scale.\n\n(iii) For fruit in bulk bins and fruit in individual packages for direct sale to the consumer made up by weight, the maximum size difference between the smallest and the largest fruit in the same lot or package must not exceed the range obtained by grouping three consecutive sizes in the size scale.\n\nIV. PROVISIONS CONCERNING TOLERANCES\n\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed in each package for produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\n\nA. Quality tolerances\n\n(i) ""Extra"" Class\n\n5 % by number or weight of citrus fruit not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class I or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n\n(ii) Class I\n\n10 % by number or weight of citrus fruit not satisfying the requirements of the class, but meeting those of Class II, or exceptionally, coming within the tolerances of that class.\n\n(iii) Class II\n\n10 % by number or weight of citrus fruit satisfying neither the requirements of the class, nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption. Within this tolerance, a maximum of 5 % is allowed of fruit showing slight superficial unhealed damage, dry cuts or soft and shrivelled fruit.\n\nB. Size tolerances\n\nFor all classes and types of presentation: 10 % by number or weight of citrus fruit corresponding to the size immediately below and/or above that (or those, in the case of the combination of three sizes) mentioned on the packages is allowed.\n\nIn any case, the tolerance of 10 % applies only to fruit not smaller than the following minima:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nV.

Having regard to the Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1954/2003 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 2371/2002 and (EC) No 639/2004 and Council Decision 2004/585/EC (1), and in particular Articles 15(6) and 18(1) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 aims to progressively eliminate discards in all Union fisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of species subject to catch limits.
(2) Article 15(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 empowers the Commission to adopt discard plans by means of a delegated act for a period of no more than three years on the basis of joint recommendations developed by Member States in consultation with the relevant Advisory Councils.
(3) Belgium, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal have a direct fisheries management interest in the south-western waters. Those Member States have submitted a joint recommendation to the Commission containing specific measures, after consultation of the Pelagic Advisory Council, the Long-Distance Advisory Council and the South Western Waters Advisory Council. Scientific contribution was obtained from relevant scientific bodies. The measures included in the joint recommendation comply with Article 15(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 and therefore, in accordance with Article 18(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 they should be included in this Regulation.
(4) As regards the south-western waters, according to Article 15(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 the landing obligation should apply to all vessels engaged in small pelagic and large pelagic fisheries in relation to species caught in those fisheries which are subject to catch limits at the latest from 1 January 2015.
(5) In accordance with the joint recommendation, the discard plan should cover certain small pelagic and large pelagic fisheries, namely the fisheries for horse mackerel, mackerel, sprat, anchovy, albacore tuna, blue whiting and jack mackerel in ICES zones VIII, IX and X and in CECAF zones 34.1.1, 34.1.2 and 34.2.0 from 1 January 2015.
(6) The joint recommendation includes an exemption from the landing obligation for anchovy, horse mackerel, jack mackerel and mackerel caught in purse seine fisheries in ICES areas VIII, IX and X and CECAF areas 34.1.1, 34.1.2 and 34.2, based on scientific evidence of high survivability, in accordance with Article 15(4)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. Scientific evidence supporting high survivability was provided in the Joint Recommendation, which made reference to a specific scientific study on fish survival from slipping in purse seine fisheries of European Southern waters. The study found that survival rates depend on the crowding time and the density of fish within the net, which are typically limited in these fisheries. This information was reviewed by the STECF (at its second plenary meeting in 2014). STECF concluded that, assuming the results of the survival study are representative of survival rates under commercial fishing operations, the proportion of slipped fish surviving would likely be greater than 50 %. A prohibition of the release of mackerel and herring before the net is fully taken on board a fishing vessel, resulting in the loss of dead or dying fish, is set out in Article 19b(2) of Council Regulation (EU) No 850/98 (2). This survivability exemption does not affect the prohibition in force, since the release of the fish will occur at a stage of the fishing operation where the fish would have a high survival rate after release. Therefore such an exemption should be included in this Regulation.
(7) The joint recommendation also includes four de minimis exemptions from the landing obligation for certain fisheries and up to certain levels. The evidence provided by the Member States was reviewed by the STECF, which concluded that the joint recommendations contained reasoned arguments related to the increase of costs in handling unwanted catches, supported in some cases with a qualitative assessment of the costs. In light of the above and in the absence of differing scientific information, it is appropriate to establish the de minimis exemptions in accordance with the percentage level proposed in the joint recommendation and at levels not exceeding those allowed under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
(8) The de minimis exemption for blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), up to a maximum of 7 % in 2015 and 2016, and 6 % in 2017, of the total annual catches in the industrial pelagic trawler fishery targeting that species in ICES zone VIII and processing that species on board to obtain surimi base, is based on the fact that increased selectivity cannot be achieved, and that costs of handling the unwanted catch is disproportionate. STECF concludes that the exemption is sufficiently well argued. Therefore, the exemption concerned should be included in this Regulation.
(9) The de minimis exemption for up to a maximum of 7 % in 2015 and 2016, and 6 % in 2017 for albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga) of the total annual catches in the albacore tuna directed fisheries using midwater pair trawls (PTM) in ICES zone VIII, is based on the disproportionate costs of handling the unwanted catch. These are costs of storage and handling at sea and on shore. STECF in its evaluation mentioned the risk of highgrading. However, this exemption is without prejudice to Article 19a of Regulation (EC) No 850/98. Therefore, the exemption concerned should be included in this Regulation.
(10) The de minimis exemption for up to a maximum of 5 % in 2015 and 2016, and 4 % in 2017, of the total annual catches in the pelagic trawl fishery for anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) in ICES zone VIII is based on the difficulty to improve selectivity in this fishery. STECF concludes that the exemption is well argued for mackerel and horse mackerel and notes a partial risk of highgrading for anchovy. This exemption is however without prejudice to Article 19a of Regulation (EC) No 850/98. Therefore, the exemption concerned should be included in this Regulation.
(11) A final de minimis exemption is for the purse seine fishery in ICES zones VIII, IX and X and in CECAF areas 34.1.1, 34.1.2 and 34.2.0 targeting the following species: up to a maximum of 5 % in 2015 and 2016, and 4 % in 2017, of the total annual catches of horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus); and up to a maximum of 2 % in 2015 and 2016, and 1 % in 2017, of the total annual catches of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus). STECF concludes that this exemption is supported by reasoned arguments which demonstrate the difficulties of improving the selectivity in this fishery. Therefore, the exemption concerned should be included in this Regulation.
(12) Finally, the joint recommendation includes a minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) of 9 cm for two fisheries for anchovy with the aim of ensuring the protection of juveniles of that species. The STECF evaluated this measure and concluded that it would not impact negatively on juvenile anchovy, that it would increase the level of catches that could be sold for human consumption without increasing fishing mortality, and that it may have benefits for control and enforcement. Therefore, the MCRS for anchovy in the fisheries concerned should be fixed at 9 cm.
(13) Since the measures provided in this Regulation impact directly on the economic activities linked to, and the planning of the fishing season of Union vessels, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication. It should apply from 1 January 2015 in order to comply with the time-frame set out in Article 15 of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. In accordance with Article 15(6) of that Regulation, this Regulation should apply for no more than three years,","{'header': '30.12.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 370/31', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 1394/2014\nof 20 October 2014\nestablishing a discard plan for certain pelagic fisheries in south-western waters', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 aims to progressively eliminate discards in all Union fisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of species subject to catch limits.\n\n((2)) Article 15(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 empowers the Commission to adopt discard plans by means of a delegated act for a period of no more than three years on the basis of joint recommendations developed by Member States in consultation with the relevant Advisory Councils.\n\n((3)) Belgium, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Portugal have a direct fisheries management interest in the south-western waters.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 (2), imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more (the product concerned), falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 and originating in India. The measures took the form of an ad valorem duty ranging between 0 % and 35,4 % for individual exporters, with a rate of 48,8 % for non-cooperating exporters.
B.   CURRENT PROCEDURE
1.   Request for review
(2) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, pursuant to Article 20 of the basic Regulation, from one Indian producer, VSL Wires Limited (the applicant). The applicant claimed that it was not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India. Furthermore, it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (i.e. from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998), but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. On the basis of the above, it requested that an individual duty rate be established for it.
2.   Initiation of an accelerated review
(3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3), an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the company concerned and commenced its investigation.
3.   Product concerned
(4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, namely stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more, containing by weight 2,5 % or more of nickel, excluding wire containing by weight 28 % or more but no more than 31 % of nickel and 20 % or more but no more than 22 % of chromium.
4.   Investigation period
(5) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003 (the review investigation period).
5.   Parties concerned
(6) The Commission officially advised the applicant and the Government of India (GOI) of the initiation of the procedure. Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However, no such views or any request for a hearing was received by the Commission.
(7) The Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant and received a full reply within the required deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out a verification visit at the premises of the applicant.
C.   SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
(8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in by the applicant, the review was limited to subsidisation.
(9) The Commission examined the same subsidy schemes which were analysed in the original investigation. It also examined whether the applicant had used any subsidy schemes which were alleged to confer benefits in the original complaint but not found to have been used during the original investigation.
D.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1.   New exporter qualification
(10) The applicant was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it was not related, directly or indirectly, to any of the Indian exporting producers subject to the countervailing measures in force with regard to the product concerned.
(11) The investigation confirmed that the applicant had not exported the product concerned during the original investigation period, i. e. from 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998.
(12) It was established that the applicant had only realised one sale to the Community which actually took place in August 2001, i. e. after the original investigation period but well before the review investigation period.
(13) In reply to the questionnaire, the applicant identified only one contract that had been signed during the review investigation period, but the on-spot verification confirmed that the sale had never been materialised. Consequently, there was no irrevocable contractual obligation undertaken by the applicant to export to the Community.
(14) However, it is noted that the company had significant export sales to other countries during the review investigation period which allowed for the calculation of the benefit accruing to export sales from subsidisation, since such benefits accrue regardless of the destination of these sales.
2.   Subsidisation
(15) On the basis of the information contained in the applicant's reply to the Commission's questionnaire, the following schemes were investigated:
— Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme,
— Income Tax Exemption Scheme,
— Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme,
— Export Processing Zones/Export Oriented Units.
3.   Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB)
(16) It was established that the applicant received benefits under this scheme during the review investigation period. It made use of the DEPB on a post-export basis. The detailed description of the scheme is contained in paragraph 4.3 of the Export and Import Policy (Notification No 1/2002-07 of 31 March 2002 of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry of the Government of India).
(17) The characteristics of the DEPB have not changed since the original investigation. The scheme is a subsidy contingent in law upon export performance, and it was therefore determined during the original investigation that it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation.
(18) It was established that the applicant transferred all the DEPB credits to its related company Viraj Alloys Ltd. The same practice was also followed by three other related Indian companies of the applicant, i.e. Viraj Forgings Ltd, Viraj Impoexpo Ltd and Viraj Profiles Ltd. The investigation confirmed that Viraj Alloys Ltd is the provider of the raw materials of all the previous mentioned companies and used their transferred DEPB credits to make duty-free imports.
4.   Income Tax Exemption Scheme (ITES)
(19) It was established that the applicant received benefits under this scheme and in particular under Section 80HHC of the Indian Income Act.
(20) The characteristics of the ITES have not changed since the original investigation. It was determined during the original investigation that the ITES is a countervailable subsidy, as the GOI confers a financial contribution to the company by forgoing government revenue in the form of direct taxes on profits from exports which would otherwise be due if the income tax exemptions were not claimed by the company. However, it was found that the ITES under Section 80HHC is gradually being phased out starting from the financial year 2000-2001 until the financial year 2004-2005 when no export profit would be exempted from income tax. During the review investigation period only 50 % of profits obtained from exports were exempted from income tax.
(21) The subsidy is contingent in law upon export performance within the meaning of Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation, since it exempts profits from export sales only, and is therefore deemed to be specific.
(22) The benefit to the applicant has been calculated on the basis of the difference between the amount of taxes normally due with and without the benefit of the exemption during the review investigation period. The rate of income tax, including corporate tax plus surcharge, applicable during this period was 36,75 %. In order to establish the full benefit to the applicant and given that three companies related to the applicant have also exported the product concerned during the review investigation period (see recital 18), the amount of subsidy has been established taking into account the income tax exemptions under Section 80HHC of the applicant, Viraj Forgings Ltd, Viraj Impoexpo Ltd and Viraj Profiles Ltd. Given that the subsidy was not granted by reference to the quantities exported, the subsidy amount has been allocated over the total export turnover of the applicant and its related companies in accordance with the provisions of Article 7(2) of the basic Regulation. On this basis, it was established that VSL Wires Limited obtained under this scheme subsidies of 1,4 %.
5.   Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS)
(23) It was established that the applicant had not availed itself of the EPCGS.
6.   Export Processing Zones (EPZ)/Export Oriented Units (EOU)
(24) It was established that the applicant was not located in an EPZ and was not an EOU and, therefore, had not availed of the scheme.
7.   Other schemes
(25) It was established that the applicant had neither made use of new subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period, nor had it received any ad hoc subsidies after this date.
8.   Amount of countervailable subsidies
(26) Taking account of the definitive findings relating to the various schemes as already set out, the amount of countervailable subsidies for the applicant is as follows:
DEPB ITES Total
VSL Wires Limited 12,7 % 1,4 % 14,1 %
E.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED
(27) Based on the findings made during the investigation, it is considered that imports into the Community of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more produced and exported by VSL Wires Limited should be subject to a level of countervailing duty corresponding to individual amounts of subsidies established for this company during the review investigation period.
(28) Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.
F.   DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURES
(29) The Commission informed the applicant and the GOI of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose that Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 be amended. They were also given a reasonable period of time to comment.
(30) In its response to the disclosure, the applicant claimed that the post-export DEPB is a substitution remission/ drawback scheme which was wrongly assessed by the Commission in terms of extent of subsidy and amount of countervailable benefit. It argued that the Commission's assessment of the benefits under this scheme was incorrect since only the excess duty drawback could be considered a subsidy and that the practical operations of the system have not been investigated by the Commission.
(31) This review does not affect the date on which Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 will expire pursuant to Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '16.7.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 244/5', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1295/2004\nof 12 July 2004\namending Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire with a diameter of 1\xa0mm or more originating in India', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nGeneral\n\nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n\nGeneral\n\nCalculation of the subsidy amount\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe table in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 is hereby amended by adding the following:\n‘VSL Wires Limited, G-1/3 MIDC, Tarapur Industrial Area, Boisar District, Thane, Maharashtra, India\n14,1\nA444 ’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

(2) By virtue of Article 20a(2) of the abovementioned Regulation, the production refund must be fixed on the basis of the gap between prices on the world market and on the Community market, taking account of the import charge applicable to olive oil falling within CN subheading 1509 90 00 and the factors used for fixing the export refunds for those olive oils during the reference period.

(3) Since the objectives of the proposed action to tackle VAT evasion cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, whose action in the matter depends on information collected by the other Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the need to involve all Member States, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

Whereas the basic quantities for sugar for the mainland region of Portugal are those fixed in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal for the purpose of enabling sugar production to start up there; whereas the size of those basic quantities has proved to be insufficient to provide the impetus for the envisaged start up of sugar production, to the detriment of the producers in the region concerned; whereas the basic quantities for sugar for the mainland region of Portugal should be increased to the levels needed to permit sugar production to start up;
Whereas the length of the production year varies considerably from one region to another in the Community; whereas experience shows that this variation is particularly marked for the United Kingdom; whereas, therefore, the deadline set until now for decisions to carry forward production is no longer appropriate for that situation in the said region and thus a longer period should be provided for;
Whereas it is possible that the minimum stock system will not be sufficient to ensure supplies to one or more regions if natural disasters strike the said regions; whereas it is therefore desirable to allow undertakings established in those regions to use to that end blocked carry-over stocks for authorizing them to dispose of the sugar in question before the end of the compulsory storage period,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/96 of 30 July 1996 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '24', 'title': 'Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 is hereby amended as follows:', 'text': ""Article 24 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC (1), and in particular point (b) of Article 19(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Section 4.2 of Annex I to Council Directive 86/297/EEC (2) sets out general provisions for front power take-off (PTO). Table 2 of that Annex provides for the application of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 to categories of tractors equipped with front power take-off which also sets dimensions for the front PTO location. However, these location requirements are not compatible with a large number of agricultural and forestry tractors due to new design requirements.
(2) The requirements for front power take-off set out in Directive 86/297/EEC only concern safety issues, that is, the PTO location, the requirements of shielding and the clearance zone. The PTO location imposed by Directive 86/297/EEC is not compatible with several tractor categories currently on the market and their mounted implements. Table 2 of Annex I to Directive 86/297/EEC already excludes tractor categories T4.1 and T4.3 from the location requirements.
(3) Tractors of categories T1, T2, T3, T4.2 and T5, in addition to those of categories T4.1 and T4.3 currently exempted from the requirements of clause 4.2 of standard ISO 8759-1:1998, cannot comply with such requirements.
(4) Several tractors can be equipped with special power take-off types, to which standard ISO 8759-1:1998 does not apply.
(5) In the case of tractors of category T3, the standard only applies when the tractor is equipped with a power take-off specified in that standard. However, other vehicle categories, such as T2 and certain smaller T1 tractors, could be equipped with special power take-off types, which are not covered by the standard. Consequently, exemption from the requirements of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 should also be extended to tractor categories T1 and T2.
(6) Difficulties of the same kind are encountered in the corresponding C categories.

Table 2 of that Annex provides for the application of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 to categories of tractors equipped with front power take-off which also sets dimensions for the front PTO location. However, these location requirements are not compatible with a large number of agricultural and forestry tractors due to new design requirements.\n\n((2)) The requirements for front power take-off set out in Directive 86/297/EEC only concern safety issues, that is, the PTO location, the requirements of shielding and the clearance zone. The PTO location imposed by Directive 86/297/EEC is not compatible with several tractor categories currently on the market and their mounted implements. Table 2 of Annex I to Directive 86/297/EEC already excludes tractor categories T4.1 and T4.3 from the location requirements.\n\n((3)) Tractors of categories T1, T2, T3, T4.2 and T5, in addition to those of categories T4.1 and T4.3 currently exempted from the requirements of clause 4.2 of standard ISO 8759-1:1998, cannot comply with such requirements.\n\n((4)) Several tractors can be equipped with special power take-off types, to which standard ISO 8759-1:1998 does not apply.\n\n((5)) In the case of tractors of category T3, the standard only applies when the tractor is equipped with a power take-off specified in that standard. However, other vehicle categories, such as T2 and certain smaller T1 tractors, could be equipped with special power take-off types, which are not covered by the standard. Consequently, exemption from the requirements of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 should also be extended to tractor categories T1 and T2.\n\n((6)) Difficulties of the same kind are encountered in the corresponding C categories.\n\n((7)) As the specifications of standard ISO 8759-1:1998 with the exception of clause 4.2, are to apply to tractors of all T and C categories which are equipped with front power take-offs, Table 2 becomes redundant and should therefore be deleted.\n\n((8)) Directive 86/297/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/37/EC,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 86/297/EEC is amended as follows:\n(1)\npoint 4.2 is replaced by the following:\n‘4.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Provisions for front power take-offs\nThe specifications of ISO 8759-1:1998, with the exception of its clause 4.2, apply to tractors of all T and C categories which are equipped with front power take-offs as specified in this standard.’;\n(2)\nTable 2 is deleted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 October 2013 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, carbetocin, quillaia saponins, butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, sodium butyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and sodium benzyl 4-hydroxybenzoate should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, baquiloprim should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Annex I to Directive 78/1015/EEC (1) defines limits for the sound level of motorcycles; whereas Article 8 of that Directive states that the Council shall, on a proposal from the Commission, decide on a reduction in the maximum permissible sound levels provided for in the said Annex I;
Whereas, when Directive 78/1015/EEC was adopted, emphasis was given to the fact that it costituted a step towards the improvement of the environment, that the technical development of less noisy motorcycles should be further encouraged that the limit values prescribed at the time should be reduced to approximately 80 dB (A) before 1985, particularly in the case of more powerful motorcycles, and that the levels to be fixed should take account of the technical resources which would be available at that date;

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 855/84 of 31 March 1984 on the calculation and dismantlement of the monetary compensatory amounts applying to certain agricultural products (4) provided for an adaptation of the representative rates which, in the case of the Federal Republic of Germany, must, on 1 January 1985, entail lower prices when expressed in national currency and consequently lower farm incomes; whereas, by way of compensation, the possibility of granting special national aids to which the Community would contribute on a temporary and degressive basis was provided for in that Regulation;
Whereas Article 3 of the said Regulation thus authorized Germany to grant a special aid, using value added tax as an instrument, of an amount not exceeding 3 % of the price excluding VAT paid by the purchaser of the agricultural product;
Whereas Council Decision 84/361/EEC of 30 June 1984 concerning an aid granted to farmers in the Federal Republic of Germany (5), authorized Germany to exceed this limit and to apply a percentage of 5 % for the period between 1 July 1984 and 31 December 1988; whereas, as a result, it is necessary that this Directive shall apply from 1 July 1984;
Whereas, however, the compensation thus granted should not exceed the effects of the dismantlement of monetary compensatory amounts;
Whereas the temporary and degressive nature of the consequences of the dismantlement of monetary compensatory amounts requires that the period for which the special aid of 3 % is to be granted should be limited to 31 December 1991;
Whereas it is necessary that Germany takes steps to ensure that the own resources relating to the transactions covered by this Directive are not affected by the application of this Directive;
Whereas, having regard to the purpose for which Germany has been authorized to grant the special aid, it is necessary for the measures taken in pursuance of that authorization and by virtue of this Directive to be reviewed and evaluated by the Commission; whereas this may conveniently be effected by means of an annual report to be presented to the European Parliament and the Council;

of 30 October 2003
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice-products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(10), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(11), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(12), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(13), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(14) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(15) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(9) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(16), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary are not eligible for export refunds.
(10) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(17), with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, are not eligible for export refunds.
(11) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 (1) of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat, and in particular Article 12 (4) thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Whereas Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that sluice-gate prices are to be fixed only for certain of the products other than pig carcases in Article 1 of that Regulation and that for these the sluice-gate prices shall be derived from the sluice-gate price for pig carcases;
Whereas the system of sluice-gate prices only achieves its purpose if an offer price can be fixed which is sufficiently representative of all products falling within a single Tariff heading ; whereas such an offer price cannot always be fixed for certain products which are manufactured from various cuts and by various methods and are consequently offered on the market in a wide range of qualities ; whereas sluice-gate prices should accordingly not at present be fixed for those products;
Whereas under Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 the sluice-gate price for pig carcases is to be made up of three components:    - an amount equal to the value on the world market of the quantity of feed grain equivalent to the quantity of feedingstuffs required for the production in third countries of one kilogramme of pigmeat,
- a standard amount representing the extra cost, in relation to feed grain, of feedingstuffs other than grain required for the production of one kilogramme of pigmeat,
- a standard amount representing overhead costs of production and marketing;
Whereas this quantity of feed grain should be calculated on the basis of a processing coefficient of 1 : 5.46 ; whereas this coefficient is obtained by multiplying the total quantity of feedingstuffs required for the production and fattening of a young pig, (such quantity containing on average approximately 15 % of feedingstuffs other than grain), by a coefficient of 1.3 expressing the ratio of the value of one kilogramme of live swine to that of one kilogramme of pig carcases;
Whereas it is appropriate to take as representative of the relevant quantity of feed grain on the world market a mixture of cereals with the following composition: >PIC FILE= ""T0008429"">
Whereas, for the purpose of calculating the value of this quantity of feed grain and in view of its composition, it is thus clear that its price on the world market is equal to the average, weighted according to the composition of the above quantity, of the prices for each of the cereals in question;
Whereas in order to calculate the price of each of the constituent cereals the average cif price for such cereals for the period mentioned in the second subparagraph of Article 12 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 should be used, this average being increased by 0.475 unit of account per 100 kilogrammes of cereals in order to take account of the costs of transport to the place of use and of the cost of processing into feed;
Whereas the value for the quantity of feed grain does not take into account the extra value of protein feeds, mineral salts and vitamins ; whereas in the light of experience on the world market in recent years this extra value can be estimated in general at 15 % of the value of the quantity of feed grain ; whereas the value of that quantity should accordingly be increased by that percentage;  (1)See page 1 of this Official Journal.
Whereas, on the basis of the information available, veterinary, stalling and labour costs on the world market may be estimated at approximately 15.63 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases, and the insurance, transport and trading margin costs on the world market at approximately 4.37 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases ; whereas the value of the quantity of feed grain should therefore be increased by 20 units of account per 100 kilogrammes of pig carcases;
Whereas when the sluice-gate prices applicable from 1 November, 1 February and 1 May are being fixed changes in world market prices for feed grain are to be taken into account only if the value of the quantity of feed grain varies by at least a specified minimum in relation to that used in calculating the sluice-gate price for the preceding quarter;
Whereas a variation of less than 3 % does not have a noticeable effect on the costs of pig feed ; whereas the minimum variation should therefore be fixed at 3 %,","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 2766/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 establishing the list of products for which sluice-gate prices are to be fixed and laying down the rules for fixing the sluice-gate price for pig carcases', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn addition to meat of domestic swine in carcases or half-carcases, fresh, chilled, frozen, salted or in brine, with or without heads, feet or flare fat (subheadings 02.01 A III a) 1 and 02.06 B I a) 1 of the Common Customs Tariff), sluice-gate prices shall be fixed for the following products: >PIC FILE= ""T0007944"">\n\n>PIC FILE= ""T0007945"">'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89 of 19 June 1989 setting general rules on the production aid for high-quality flint maize (3), and in particular Articles 3 (2) and 4 (1) (c) thereof,
Whereas the suitable areas for the production of high-quality flint maize must be defined; whereas the natural drying to a moisture content not exceeding 15 % as specified in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89 requires suitable climatic conditions; whereas the production areas should be restricted to those areas having such climatic conditions;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 10a (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, the minimum particulars which must be included in the cultivation contract should be laid down;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89, Member States must introduce the administrative arrangements, including physical inspection, necessary to ensure that the qualifying requirements for the aid are met; whereas, for the purposes of the inspections to be carried out, only one declaration may be submitted per cultivation contract; whereas the crop declaration and contract must include certain minimum particulars;

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 specifies that the time when a transaction was carried out is considered as being the date of the event by which the aid becomes due and payable; whereas in the case of flint maize that event is harvest; whereas, in view of the difficulty in determining the exact of harvesting in each case, the date to be taken as the representative date of harvest should be the first day of the marketing year in respect of which the entitlement to aid arises;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3745/89 (7), applies to the security provided for in this Regulation; whereas it is therefore necessary to define the primary requirements incumbent upon manufacturers of swollen or roasted cereal products falling within CN code 1904 10 10;
Whereas certain rules provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89 should be specified more clearly by defining the minimum items of information to be checked; whereas, on account of the cost and administrative difficulties, a simplified system would be suitable for declarations relating to small areas;
Whereas provision should be made for measures to discourage declarations which do not correspond to the facts;
Whereas the list of varieties of the product in question must be adopted taking into account the definition of high-quality flint maize laid down in Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1835/89; whereas the varieties should display the characteristics referred to in the abovementioned Article, particularly as regards kernel type, kernel tip colour and flotation test; whereas the flotation test for determining the percentage by weight of the sample which floats should be described in detail; whereas a procedure should be laid down for including varieties of flint maize on the list;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 14(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) 2-phenylphenol is an active substance belonging to the fourth stage of the review programme of Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) for which the assessment report was presented to the Commission on 19 December 2008 in the format of the EFSA Scientific Report for 2-phenylphenol (3). That report includes the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter ‘the Authority’, on the necessity of setting MRLs for that active substance in accordance with Article 12(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, and a proposal for such MRLs.
(2) The Authority examined in particular the risks to consumers and animals. It evaluated the representative use as a post harvest fungicide on citrus and pears and concluded that, based on the available information, a maximum residue level (MRL) of 5 mg/kg should be set provisionally for the notified use on citrus fruit by drench application. In order to confirm the risk assessment, the Authority requested confirmation that the analytical method applied in the residue trials correctly quantifies the residues of 2-phenylphenol, 2-phenylhydroquinone and their conjugates. In addition, the Authority concluded that the notifier should submit two additional residue trials on citrus fruit and valid storage stability studies. As regards the notified use on pears, the Authority could not propose any MRL because the submitted residue data were not acceptable. In the absence of a specific MRL, the lowest limit of analytical determination should apply.
(3) The risk assessment carried out by the Authority took into account the most recent information on the toxicological properties of 2-phenylphenol. It showed that an MRL of 5 mg/kg for citrus fruit is acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups. The lifetime exposure assessment via consumption of all food products that may contain 2-phenylphenol showed that there is no risk that the acceptable daily intake (ADI) is exceeded. As an acute reference dose (ARfD) is not necessary for 2-phenylphenol, there was no need to evaluate the short term exposure.
(4) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the EFSA Scientific report for 2-phenylphenol, including the proposed MRLs. The notifier submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.
(5) Based on the Scientific Report of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter under consideration, the proposed MRLs fulfil the requirements of Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3447/90 of 28 November 1990 on special conditions for the granting of private storage aid for sheepmeat and goatmeat(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 40/96(6), lays down in particular the minimum quantities per contract.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below.
(3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81, the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81.
(4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances, to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations.
(5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination.
(6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 488/2002(4).
(7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6), Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1/2003(2), and in particular Articles 3 and 16 thereof,
Having regard to the Commission Decision of 8 March 2001 to initiate proceedings in this case,
Having regard to the Commission Decision 2002/165/EC(3) based on Regulation No 17, and particularly on the Commission's powers under Article 3 thereof to adopt interim measures, addressed and notified to IMS Health in this case,
Having regard to the application for withdrawal of the decision by IMS Health on 31 October 2002,
Having given IMS Health, NDC Health and AzyX the opportunity to make known their views on whether or not the Commission should withdraw the interim measures decision on grounds of lack of urgency,
Having regard to the final report of the Hearing Officer in this case(4),
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
(1) IMS Health (IMS) has created, in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry over a long period of time, a brick structure for the presentation of regional pharmaceutical prescription and sales data services in Germany. The Commission found in its Decision 2002/165/EC that this constituted a de facto industry standard and it was acknowledged to be so by the pharmaceutical companies. The need for comparable and compatible data, the possible loss of relationship between sales representatives and the doctors, the modification of the working contracts of sales representatives and the costs incurred to modify software and applications based on the 1860 brick structure if pharmaceutical companies were to switch to another brick structure, were considered as creating a very significant obstacle for them to do so. Moreover, technical and other constraints such as the necessary use of administrative boundaries, the data-protection law and the uncertainty concerning the permissibility under copyright law of selling data in another structure based on postal districts, gravely limited the possibilities to create other marketable brick structures. In particular, the Landgericht Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt District Court) had granted, between October and December 2000, separate injunctions prohibiting NDC Health (NDC) (an American multinational company), AzyX (a much smaller Belgian company) and Pharma Intranet Information (PI, now a subsidiary of NDC), competitors of IMS on the regional pharmaceutical sales data services market, from using structures derived from the 1860 brick structure on the basis that IMS enjoyed copyright protection.
(2) The Commission also found that IMS had no objective justification for refusing to grant a licence for the 1860 brick structure to, NDC and AzyX. The Commission considered that there was a prima facie case of behaviour constituting an abuse under Article 82. The Commission considered that there were ""exceptional circumstances"" within the meaning of the phrase used by the European Court of Justice in Magill(5) read in conjunction with the Ladbroke(6) and Bronner(7) cases. The use of the 1860 brick structure was considered as being indispensable to carrying on business on the relevant market because there was no actual or potential substitute for it.
(3) The Commission found that the refusal by IMS to license the 1860 brick structure created a risk of serious and irreparable harm to the complainant, NDC, and of intolerable damage to the public interest which established the urgent need to grant protective interim measures. First, the Commission considered, on the basis of the evidence before it, that unless NDC was granted a licence to the 1860 brick structure its German operation would go out of business. In the Commission's view, without interim measures, NDC would lose current customers, had no prospect of attracting new customers for the coming years and would probably cease trading in Germany. Second, apart from the serious risk of irreparable harm to NDC, there was also a risk of intolerable damage to the public interest within the meaning of the La Cinq judgment(8). Since without the 1860 brick structure it was not possible to compete on the market at that time or in the foreseeable future, there would be, in the absence of interim measures, a serious risk to the continued presence on the market of the other competitor then active, AzyX. Finally, rejecting IMS's contention that it would suffer irreparable harm, the Commission concluded that the balance of interests in this case favoured both NDC and the public interest.
(4) The Commission therefore adopted Decision 2002/165/EC, which ordered IMS, by way of interim measures, to license the 1860 brick structure to its then competitors on the market for German regional pharmaceutical sales data services, in return for royalties to be agreed by the parties within a two-week period of the date of the request for a licence failing which appropriate royalties would be determined by independent experts.
(5) By application lodged at the Registry of the Court of First Instance on 6 August 2001 under the reference T-184/01, IMS Health brought an action seeking the annulment of the decision or alternatively annulment of its decision concerning the requirement to license the 1860 brick structure in circumstances where the licence terms would be conducted and approved by the Commission and the suspension of the operation of the Commission's Decision.
(6) By an Order of 26 October 2001 in case T-184/01R, the President of the Court of First Instance (CFI) suspended the execution of Commission Decision 2002/165/EC until such time as the Court of First Instance has given judgment in the main action.
(7) By application lodged at the Court Registry on 12 December 2001 under the reference C-481/01 P(R), NDC Health Corporation appealed against the abovementioned order of the President of the CFI.
(8) By an Order of 11 April 2002 in case C-481/01P(R), the President of the Court of Justice (ECJ) dismissed the appeal of NDC.
(9) Reference has been made on 12 July 2001 to the ECJ by the Landgericht Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt District Court ) for a preliminary ruling on related questions regarding the interpretation of Article 82 of the Treaty. The reference arises in the context of a copyright infringment action before the German courts between IMS Health and NDC Health. This case was registered under the reference C-418/01 and is still pending and proceedings in the main action concerning Decision 2002/165/EC have been stayed until judgment has been given in that preliminary ruling.
(10) In a judgment of 17 September 2002, the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main (Frankfurt Higher Regional Court) dismissed an appeal brought by PI against the abovementioned judgment of the Frankfurt District Court enjoining PI and its co-founder from using the 1860 brick structure or any derivative thereof. While recognising that the 1860 brick structure was protected by national copyright (the relevant right being held by, inter alia, certain IMS employees rather than by IMS itself) and that direct reproduction of that structure by a competitor of IMS constituted a breach of the Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb (Law on Unfair Competition), the Higher Regional Court held that ""der Beklagten oder Dritten die freie, selbständige Entwicklung einer Segmentstruktur, die ebenfalls auf der Einteilung nach Landkreisen, kreisfreien Städten und Postleitzahlbezirken beruht und deshalb ggfs. aus einer annähernd gleichen Anzahl von Segmenten besteht, nicht ohne weiteres untersagt werden könnte. (...) Insbesondere könnte es der Beklagten oder Dritten nicht zugemutet werden, eine den praktischen Anforderungen nur unzulänglich gerecht werdende Datenstruktur zu erstellen, nur um einen möglichst weiten Abstand von dem Produkt der Klägerin zu halten. Vielmehr können Abweichungen nicht verlangt werden, wo die Übereinstimmungen auf sachlich - technischen Anforderungen beruhen und unter Berücksichtigung des Freihaltebedürfnisses der Wettbewerber in diesen Merkmalen die angemessene Verwirklichung der Technischen Aufgabe liegt."" (The defendant or third parties could not simply be prohibited from developing freely and independently a brick structure that is similarly based on a breakdown by district, urban district and post-code district and for that reason comprise more or less the same number of bricks. (...) In particular, the defendant or third parties could not be expected to produce a data structure that does not sufficiently satisfy the practical requirements simply in order to keep as much distance as possible from the plaintiff's product. Instead, variations cannot be demanded where the overlaps are based on material technical requirements and, in the light taking into account ""the need of availability"" for competitors, the appropriate performance of the technical task depends on these features).
(11) On 16 April 2003, the Frankfurt District Court forbade AzyX to use the 1860 brick structure and any derivative of it. This judgment was not appealed before the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court.
(12) In its observations of 12 May 2003 on whether or not the Commission should withdraw the interim measures decision, IMS considered that the interpretation of the 17 September 2002 raises legal and factual questions that remain sub judice before the German Courts and that it is for them to determine the precise scope of that judgment. As to the withdrawal of the interim measures decision, IMS suggested that the appropriate course of action would be to withdraw that decision since none of the conditions for interim measures are satisfied, including, but not limited to the lack of urgency. As for the current situation in the market, in 2002, IMS had a market share of between [...](9) and [...] % in value and [...] contracts. In the first quarter of 2003, this market share increased by [...] points in value and to [...] contracts taking into account the situation of AzyX.
(13) In its observations of 12 May 2003, NDC considered that there is still considerable uncertainty as to what could be regarded as a derivative of the 1860 brick structure, in particular what is substantially similar to the 1860 brick structure and consequently prohibited under German copyright law. NDC is currently offering data in a structure consisting in around 4000 bricks. This structure is consistent with the structures used by the German postal services. Nevertheless NDC has signed a certain number of new contracts since the 17 September judgment was rendered and there is now apparently greater scope for competitors of IMS to stay on the market as NDC represented between [...] and [...] % in value of the market in 2002 and increased its market share by [...] points in the first quarter with a large amount of contracts. Moreover, NDC has been able to conclude contracts with some bigger pharmaceutical undertakings in its view since the judgement, whereas it previously had no contracts with the top 20 firms.
(14) AzyX stopped its activities in Germany on 12 March 2003. AzyX had some contracts and represented between [...] and [...] % in value of the market for German regional pharmaceutical sales data services at the end of 2002. According to AzyX, the losses were caused by its difficulties, driven in its view by the legal uncertainty, in achieving a sustainable level of penetration of the German market and were no longer bearable.
(15) As regards AzyX, its withdrawal from the German market for regional pharmaceutical sales data services constitutes a material change in circumstances. To the extent that the Commission's decision sought to preserve the public interest in viable competition on that market until a final decision could be adopted in this case, that objective can no longer be realised by requiring the grant of a licence to AzyX. The grant of such a licence to AzyX therefore is not possible and is no longer urgent.
(16) As regards NDC's own interests and the public interest in the maintenance of the sole surviving source of competition, it is not necessary for the Commission to take a position on the likely outcome of the pending proceedings for breach of copyright and unfair competition between IMS and NDC. The Commission notes that the Frankfurt Higher Regional Court's judgment of 17 September 2002 coincides with an improvement in the market position of NDC, based on use of the abovementioned structure. In particular, NDC has, for the first time, succeeded in concluding contracts with some larger pharmaceutical companies in the period subsequent to the judgment and its projections for 2003 indicate a general improvement relative to previous years. Therefore, without prejudice to the question whether the judgment of 17 September 2002 has caused this improvement in the commercial position of NDC, there has been a material change in circumstances. The threat of extinction of NDC, posed to NDC and to the public interest in competition, no longer has the urgency to require the grant of a licence to NDC which was identified by the Commission at the time of adoption of its Decision and which is necessary to justify the maintenance of interim measures.
(17) It is therefore necessary to withdraw Decision 2002/165/EC notified to IMS Health on the ground that there is no longer proven urgency requiring the prevention of irreparable damage to NDC and to the public interest in competition before the Commission adopts the decision concluding the present administrative proceeding,","{'title': '2003/741/EC: Commission Decision of 13 August 2003 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP D3/38.044 — NDC Health/IMS Health: Interim measures) (notified under document number C(2003) 2920)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nCommission Decision 2002/165/EC of 3 July 2001, relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 82 of the EC Treaty (COMP/D3/38.044 NDC Health/IMS Health: Interim measures) is hereby withdrawn.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to: IMS Health Harewood Avenue London NW1 United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 August 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario Monti\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62.\n\n(2) OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 59, 28.2.2002, p. 18.\n\n(4) OJ C 250, 18.10.2003.\n\n(5) Joined cases C-241/91 P and C-242/91 P, Radio Telefis Eireann (RTE) and Independent Television Publications Ltd (ITP) v Commission, [1995] ECR p.

amending Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 2(1)(h) thereof,
Having regard to the requests submitted by the Czech Republic, Greece, France and Italy,
Whereas:
(1) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 (2), certain Member States or certain areas in Member States were recognised as protected zones in respect of certain harmful organisms. In some cases recognition was granted for a limited period of time to allow the Member State concerned to provide the full information necessary to show that the harmful organisms in question did not occur in the Member State or area concerned or to complete the efforts to eradicate the organism in question.
(2) The entire territory of Greece was recognised as a protected zone with respect to Dendroctonus micans Kugelan, Gilpinia hercyniae (Hartig), Gonipterus scutellatus Gyll., Ips amitinus Eichhof, Ips cembrae Heer and Ips duplicatus Sahlberg until 31 March 2011.
(3) In 2010 Greece conducted surveys and notified results to the Commission in accordance with the third and fifth subparagraph of Article 2(1)(h) of Directive 2000/29/EC. A visit of Commission experts in Greece from 24 to 31 January 2011 confirmed that that Member State continued to make significant progress with regard to organising and conducting those surveys and with regard to notifying the results thereof. It is, nevertheless, necessary that Greece proves that the progress made is sustainable.
(4) According to the results of the surveys carried out in Greece in 2010, there was only one finding of Ips cembrae Heer, there were no findings of the other five organisms concerned. Taking into account those results and the outcome of the visit of the Commission experts in Greece, it is appropriate to continue to recognise Greece as a protected zone with respect to those organisms for three more years, in order to give Greece the time necessary to collect and submit information confirming that those organisms, with the exception of Ips cembrae Heer, do not occur in its territory and, as regards Ips cembrae Heer, to complete the efforts to eradicate it and collect and submit the information confirming that that organism no more occurs in its territory.
(5) The entire territory of Greece was recognised as a protected zone with respect to citrus tristeza virus (European strains). In its annual report for 2010 on the official survey carried out for the presence of that harmful organism, Greece reported 104 trees tested positive for that harmful organism in the Prefecture of Argolida. Observations made by the Commission experts during their visit in Greece from 24 to 31 January 2011 confirmed that citrus tristeza virus (European strains) was present in that prefecture at least for the last three years in spite of the eradication measures taken by the Greek authorities which have proved to be ineffective. Consequently, citrus tristeza virus (European strains) has to be considered as established in the Prefecture of Argolida. That prefecture should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.
(6) The entire territory of Spain was recognised as a protected zone with respect to Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. Spain has submitted information showing that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in the autonomous community of Castilla y León. The measures taken for a period of two successive years, 2009 and 2010, with a view to the eradication of that harmful organism have proved to be ineffective. Castilla y León should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.
(7) The entire territory of the Czech Republic, certain regions of France (Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine) and one region in Italy (Basilicata) were recognised as protected zones with respect to grapevine flavescence dorée MLO until 31 March 2011. Information supplied by the Czech Republic, France and Italy since that recognition was granted, has provided evidence that that harmful organism does not occur in the protected zones concerned. Therefore the entire territory of the Czech Republic, the regions of Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine in France and the region of Basilicata in Italy should continue to be recognised as protected zones with respect to that organism.
(8) Italy has requested that the region of Sardinia be recognised as a protected zone in respect of the harmful organism grapevine flavescence dorée MLO. On the basis of surveys conducted in 2004-2010, Italy has submitted evidence that the harmful organism concerned does not occur in the region of Sardinia despite favourable conditions for that organism to establish itself there. It is, however, necessary that further surveys be carried out. Those surveys should be monitored by experts under the authority of the Commission. Therefore Sardinia should be recognised as a protected zone in respect of grapevine flavescence dorée MLO for a period of three years only.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The current recognition of some of these protected zones expires on 31 March 2011. Therefore, this Regulation should apply from 1 April 2011 so as to allow an uninterrupted recognition of all protected zones.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'header': '6.5.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 118/2', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 436/2011\nof 5 May 2011\namending Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2008(2), certain Member States or certain areas in Member States were recognised as protected zones in respect of certain harmful organisms. In some cases recognition was granted for a limited period of time to allow the Member State concerned to provide the full information necessary to show that the harmful organisms in question did not occur in the Member State or area concerned or to complete the efforts to eradicate the organism in question.\n\n((2)) The entire territory of Greece was recognised as a protected zone with respect toDendroctonus micansKugelan,Gilpinia hercyniae(Hartig),Gonipterus scutellatusGyll.,Ips amitinusEichhof,Ips cembraeHeer andIps duplicatusSahlberg until 31 March 2011.\n\n((3)) In 2010 Greece conducted surveys and notified results to the Commission in accordance with the third and fifth subparagraph of Article 2(1)(h) of Directive 2000/29/EC. A visit of Commission experts in Greece from 24 to 31 January 2011 confirmed that that Member State continued to make significant progress with regard to organising and conducting those surveys and with regard to notifying the results thereof. It is, nevertheless, necessary that Greece proves that the progress made is sustainable.\n\n((4)) According to the results of the surveys carried out in Greece in 2010, there was only one finding ofIps cembraeHeer, there were no findings of the other five organisms concerned. Taking into account those results and the outcome of the visit of the Commission experts in Greece, it is appropriate to continue to recognise Greece as a protected zone with respect to those organisms for three more years, in order to give Greece the time necessary to collect and submit information confirming that those organisms, with the exception ofIps cembraeHeer, do not occur in its territory and, as regardsIps cembraeHeer, to complete the efforts to eradicate it and collect and submit the information confirming that that organism no more occurs in its territory.\n\n((5)) The entire territory of Greece was recognised as a protected zone with respect to citrus tristeza virus (European strains). In its annual report for 2010 on the official survey carried out for the presence of that harmful organism, Greece reported 104 trees tested positive for that harmful organism in the Prefecture of Argolida. Observations made by the Commission experts during their visit in Greece from 24 to 31 January 2011 confirmed that citrus tristeza virus (European strains) was present in that prefecture at least for the last three years in spite of the eradication measures taken by the Greek authorities which have proved to be ineffective. Consequently, citrus tristeza virus (European strains) has to be considered as established in the Prefecture of Argolida. That prefecture should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n\n((6)) The entire territory of Spain was recognised as a protected zone with respect toErwinia amylovora(Burr.) Winsl. et al. Spain has submitted information showing thatErwinia amylovora(Burr.) Winsl. et al. is now established in the autonomous community of Castilla y León. The measures taken for a period of two successive years, 2009 and 2010, with a view to the eradication of that harmful organism have proved to be ineffective. Castilla y León should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.\n\n((7)) The entire territory of the Czech Republic, certain regions of France (Alsace, Champagne-Ardenne and Lorraine) and one region in Italy (Basilicata) were recognised as protected zones with respect to grapevine flavescence dorée MLO until 31 March 2011.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Community has undertaken to open annual duty- free Community tariff quotas for cod, whole, salted, and fillets of cod, salted, falling within subheadings ex 03.02 A I b) and ex 03.02 A II a) of the Common Customs Tariff, and for 1987 within the limits of 6 000 and 4 000 tonnes respectively; whereas the benefit of the first of these is provided for fish of the 'Gadus morhua' species; whereas, therefore, it is necessary to open on 1 January 1987 the tariff quotas in question and to allocate them among the Member States;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of levy for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is used up; whereas, in the light of the principles outlined above, a Community tariff arrangement based on an allocation between the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to represent as closely as possible the actual development of the market in the product in question, the allocation should follow proportionately the requirements of the Member States calculated both from statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and according to the economic outlook for the tariff year in question;
Whereas, however, the products in question are not as such separately specified in the statistical nomenclatures; whereas it has therefore not yet been possible to obtain sufficiently precise and representative figures; whereas, therefore, figures should be based on statistics of imports from third countries which do not benefit from a tariff preference of cod and cod fillets whatever their species, presentation or method of preservation; whereas, for these products, the percentage shares of the initial participation in the quota volumes can thus be established as follows:
1.2.3 //  //  //  //  // ex 03.02 A I b)   // ex 03.02 A II a)   //    //   //   // Benelux   // 1,63   // 0,04  // Denmark   // 1,68   // 0,08   // Germany   // 2,89  // 0,08   // Greece   // 16,71   // 1,02   // France  // 29,03   // 4,13   // Ireland   // 0,03   // 0,04   // Italy   // 46,46   // 95,57   // United Kingdom   // 1,57   // 0,04  //    //   //
Whereas, to take account of the possible import trends for these fish, the quota volumes should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated between the Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial share; whereas, to give importers some degree of certainty, the first instalment of the tariff quotas should be fixed at a high level, which in this case, could be approximately 60 % of the amount of the quota volumes;
Whereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas each time its additional share is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission and the Commission must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused it is essential that such State should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 411/87 of 9 February 1987 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain fishery products, salted, falling within subheadings ex 03.02 A I b) and ex 03.02 A II a) of the Common Customs Tariff (1987)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(notified under document C(2011) 1032)

(2011/127/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from those specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) of that subparagraph, that amount is to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and it has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(2) On 22 October 2007, the Commission adopted Decision 2007/697/EC granting a derogation requested by Ireland pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (2), allowing Ireland the application of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure on farms with at least 80 % grassland.
(3) The derogation granted by Decision 2007/697/EC concerned approximately 5 000 farms in Ireland corresponding to approximately 2,7 % of total number of holdings with cattle or sheep, 10 % of total grazing livestock numbers and 4,2 % of the total net agricultural area. Decision 2007/697/EC expires on 17 July 2010.
(4) On 12 May 2010 Ireland submitted to the Commission a request for an extension of the derogation. The request contained a justification on the basis of the objective criteria specified in the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC.
(5) Ireland has adopted a new action programme for the period July 2010 to December 2013, which mainly maintains the measures of the action programme for the period until 30 June 2010 and applies to the whole territory of Ireland.
(6) The fourth report on implementation of Directive 91/676/EEC in Ireland for the period 2004-2007 shows in general stable or improving water quality. For groundwater, 2 % of sites showed average nitrate values above 50 mg/l and 74 % of sites values below 25 mg/l. For surface river waters, 97 % of monitoring sites showed average nitrate values below 25 mg/l, and no sites showed average values above 50 mg/l. 93 % of lakes were classified as either oligotrophic or mesotrophic and 7 % of lakes were classified as eutrophic or hypertrophic.
(7) Livestock numbers decreased further during the period 2004-2007, by about 4 % for cattle, 19 % for sheep, 4 % for pigs and 7 % for poultry (3). The annual use of organic nitrogen from livestock manure and of mineral nitrogen decreased by 5 % and 17 % respectively. The total farmed area decreased by 3 % to 4,28 million hectares and grassland still accounts for over 90 % of the agricultural area.
(8) In the light of the scientific information referred to in the request for extension of the derogation and the measures which Ireland has committed itself to in the action programme for the period July 2010 to December 2013, it can be concluded that the conditions for obtaining the derogation as specified in Directive 91/676/EEC, such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake, are still fulfilled, and that the derogation does not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of that Directive.
(9) For the purpose of ensuring that the grassland farms concerned may continue to benefit from a derogation, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of Decision 2007/697/EC to 31 December 2013.
(10) The deadlines for reporting to the Commission set out in Decision 2007/697/EC should however be adapted in order to simplify the administrative burden by allowing Ireland to establish only one deadline for all reporting obligations.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,","{'header': '25.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 51/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 24 February 2011\namending Decision 2007/697/EC granting a derogation requested by Ireland pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources\n(notified under document C(2011) 1032)\n(Only the English text is authentic)\n(2011/127/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from those specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) of that subparagraph, that amount is to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and it has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.\n\n((2)) On 22 October 2007, the Commission adopted Decision 2007/697/EC granting a derogation requested by Ireland pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources(2), allowing Ireland the application of 250\xa0kg nitrogen per hectare per year from livestock manure on farms with at least 80\xa0% grassland.\n\n((3)) The derogation granted by Decision 2007/697/EC concerned approximately 5\xa0000 farms in Ireland corresponding to approximately 2,7\xa0% of total number of holdings with cattle or sheep, 10\xa0% of total grazing livestock numbers and 4,2\xa0% of the total net agricultural area.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes decanoic acid.
(2) Decanoic acid has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 4, food and feed area disinfectants, product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, and product-type 19, repellents and attractants, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which correspond respectively to product-types 4, 18 and 19 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Austria was designated as rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority reports, together with recommendations, to the Commission on 7 December 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority reports were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 13 December 2013, in two assessment reports.
(5) It appears from those reports that biocidal products used for product-types 4, 18 and 19 and containing decanoic acid may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve decanoic acid for use in biocidal products for product-types 4, 18 and 19.
(7) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) For the use in product-type 4, the evaluation did not address the incorporation of biocidal products containing decanoic acid in materials and articles intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). Such materials may require the establishment of specific limits on the migration into food, as referred to in Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. The approval should therefore not cover such use unless the Commission has established such limits or it has been established pursuant to that Regulation that such limits are not necessary.
(9) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit Member States, interested parties, and the Commission where appropriate, to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed.

Whereas:
(1) On 23 August 2005 Bulgaria confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the administrative district of Vratsa in Bulgaria. Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry and birds and there is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.
(2) In view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, it is therefore appropriate to take measures in relation to imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds and hatching eggs of these species from Bulgaria.
(3) Bulgaria has communicated further information on the disease situation and asked for regionalisation to suspend importation into the Community from the administrative district of Vratsa only, since the situation in the rest of the country appears to be satisfactory. The information available at present gives the possibility to reduce the protection measures to a specific region.
(4) Therefore, the importation into the Community from the administrative district of Vratsa in Bulgaria should be suspended for fresh meat of poultry, ratites and wild and farmed feathered game, meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of those species, obtained from birds slaughtered after 16 July 2005.
(5) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC (3) lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products, and establishes treatment regimes in order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products. The treatment that must be applied to the product depends on the health status of the country of origin, in relation to the species the meat is obtained from; in order to avoid an unnecessary burden on trade, imports of poultry meat products originating in Bulgaria treated to a temperature of at least 70 °C throughout the product should continue to be authorised.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '15.9.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 238/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 8 September 2005\nconcerning protection measures in relation to Newcastle disease in Bulgaria\n(notified under document number C(2005) 3389)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/648/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 23 August 2005 Bulgaria confirmed an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the administrative district of Vratsa in Bulgaria.

Having regard to the request submitted by France on 27 August 2009,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 9(1)(d) of Directive 2008/57/EC, on 27 August 2009 France submitted a request for partial derogation from Commission Decision 2006/66/EC (2) (TSI noise) and from Commission Decision 2006/861/EC (3) (TSI freight wagons), for wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company.
(2) The request for derogation concerns freight wagons used to transport road trucks over rail which are manufactured according to a design that existed before the entry into force of both TSIs.
(3) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the European Railway Agency provided its technical opinion on the request for partial derogation on 24 November 2009.
(4) The opinion indicates that the provisions of six sections of TSI freight wagons describing draw gear, lifting and jacking, equipment attachment, kinematic gauge, vehicle dynamic behaviour and parking brake (respectively in sections 4.2.2.1.2.2, 4.2.2.3.2.4, 4.2.2.3.2.5, 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.4 and 4.2.4.1.2.8) cannot be applied to the wagons concerned due to their construction constraints implied by specialised kind of transported commodity. Regarding TSI noise, the wagons in question have to use, in combination with composite brake blocks, also louder cast iron blocks in order to achieve required braking performances. Therefore until more silent technology is in place the limits for pass-by noise (section 4.2.1.1 of the TSI) cannot be met.
(5) The overall economical impact of application of the two TSIs, and more specifically of sections 4.2.3.1 and 4.2.3.4 of TSI freight wagons, to the wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company is estimated to almost EUR 204 million. This amount together with other requirements that would need to be applied to comply with the TSIs would not only heavily compromise the economical viability of the project but also seriously delay or bring to a halt its implementation.
(6) The derogation is granted for a limited period of time that should be used by France to accelerate the development of innovative solutions promoted by the harmonised specifications and compliant with the TSIs in question.
(7) The provisions of this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 29 of Directive 2008/57/EC,","{'header': '29.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 107/24', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 28 April 2010\ngranting France a partial derogation from Decision 2006/66/EC concerning the technical specification for interoperability relating to the subsystem ‘rolling stock — noise’ of the trans-European conventional rail system and from Decision 2006/861/EC concerning the technical specification of interoperability relating to the subsystem ‘rolling stock — freight wagons’ of the trans-European conventional rail system\n(notified under document C(2010) 2588)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(2010/245/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 9(1)(d) of Directive 2008/57/EC, on 27 August 2009 France submitted a request for partial derogation from Commission Decision 2006/66/EC(2)(TSI noise) and from Commission Decision 2006/861/EC(3)(TSI freight wagons), for wagons type NA and AFA of LOHR company.\n\n((2)) The request for derogation concerns freight wagons used to transport road trucks over rail which are manufactured according to a design that existed before the entry into force of both TSIs.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), the European Railway Agency provided its technical opinion on the request for partial derogation on 24 November 2009.\n\n((4)) The opinion indicates that the provisions of six sections of TSI freight wagons describing draw gear, lifting and jacking, equipment attachment, kinematic gauge, vehicle dynamic behaviour and parking brake (respectively in sections 4.2.2.1.2.2, 4.2.2.3.2.4, 4.2.2.3.2.5, 4.2.3.1, 4.2.3.4 and 4.2.4.1.2.8) cannot be applied to the wagons concerned due to their construction constraints implied by specialised kind of transported commodity.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), and in particular Articles 30 and 32 thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States, accompanied by the information required for the clearance of accounts and a certificate regarding the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts and the reports established by the certification bodies, clears the accounts of the paying agencies referred to in Article 6 of the said Regulation.
(2) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the keeping of accounts by the paying agencies, declarations of expenditure and revenue and the conditions for reimbursing expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD (2), account is taken for the 2012 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2011 and 15 October 2012.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD (3) lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting the monthly payments in respect of the financial year in question, i.e. 2012, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1. The Commission shall deduct that amount from or add it to the monthly payment relating to the expenditure effected in the second month following that in which the accounts clearance decision is taken.
(4) The Commission has checked the information submitted by the Member States and it has communicated to the Member States before 31 March 2013 the results of its verifications, along with the necessary amendments.
(5) The annual accounts and the accompanying documents permit the Commission to take, for certain paying agencies, a decision on the completeness, accuracy and veracity of the annual accounts submitted. Annex I lists the amounts cleared by Member State and the amounts to be recovered from or paid to the Member States.
(6) The information submitted by certain other paying agencies requires additional inquiries and their accounts cannot be cleared in this Decision. Annex II lists the paying agencies concerned.
(7) Under Article 9(4) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, any overrun of deadlines during August, September and October is to be taken into account in the clearance of accounts decision. Some of the expenditure declared by certain Member States during these months in the year 2012 was effected after the applicable deadlines. This Decision should therefore fix the relevant reductions.
(8) The Commission, in accordance with Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 and Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 883/2006, has already reduced or suspended a number of monthly payments on entry into the accounts of expenditure for the 2012 financial year. In order to avoid any premature, or temporary, reimbursement of the amounts in question, they should not be recognised in this Decision and they should be further examined under the conformity clearance procedure pursuant to Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
(9) Pursuant to Article 32(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, 50 % of the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities shall be borne by the Member State concerned if the recovery of those irregularities has not taken place within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding, or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts. Article 32(3) of the said Regulation obliges Member States to submit to the Commission, together with the annual accounts, a summary report on the recovery procedures undertaken in response to irregularities. Detailed rules on the application of the Member States’ reporting obligation of the amounts to be recovered are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 885/2006. Annex III to the said Regulation provides the table that had to be provided in 2013 by the Member States. On the basis of the tables completed by the Member States, the Commission should decide on the financial consequences of non-recovery of irregularities older than 4 or 8 years respectively. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005.
(10) Pursuant to Article 32(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, Member States may decide not to pursue recovery. Such a decision may only be taken if the costs already, and likely to be, incurred total more than the amount to be recovered or if the recovery proves impossible owing to the insolvency, recorded and recognised under national law, of the debtor or the persons legally responsible for the irregularity. If that decision has been taken within 4 years of the primary administrative or judicial finding or within 8 years if the recovery is taken to the national courts, 100 % of the financial consequences of the non-recovery should be borne by the EU budget. In the summary report referred to in Article 32(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the amounts for which the Member State decided not to pursue recovery and the grounds for the decision are shown. These amounts are not charged to the Member States concerned and are consequently borne by the EU budget. This decision is without prejudice to future conformity decisions pursuant to Article 32(8) of the said Regulation.
(11) In accordance with Article 30(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, this Decision does not prejudice decisions taken subsequently by the Commission excluding from European Union financing expenditure not effected in accordance with European Union rules,","{'header': '30.4.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 118/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 26 April 2013\non the clearance of the accounts of the paying agencies of Member States concerning expenditure financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) for the 2012 financial year\n(notified under document C(2013) 2454)\n(2013/210/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts submitted by the Member States, accompanied by the information required for the clearance of accounts and a certificate regarding the integrality, accuracy and veracity of the accounts and the reports established by the certification bodies, clears the accounts of the paying agencies referred to in Article 6 of the said Regulation.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 883/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the keeping of accounts by the paying agencies, declarations of expenditure and revenue and the conditions for reimbursing expenditure under the EAGF and the EAFRD(2), account is taken for the 2012 financial year of expenditure incurred by the Member States between 16 October 2011 and 15 October 2012.\n\n((3)) The first subparagraph of Article 10(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 885/2006 of 21 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the accreditation of paying agencies and other bodies and the clearance of the accounts of the EAGF and of the EAFRD(3)lays down that the amounts that are recoverable from, or payable to, each Member State, in accordance with the accounts clearance decision referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 10(1) of the said Regulation, shall be determined by deducting the monthly payments in respect of the financial year in question, i.e. 2012, from expenditure recognised for that year in accordance with paragraph 1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/77 of 17 May 1977 laying down special measures to promote the marketing of lemon products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1353/86 (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas, under Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/77, the minimum price which processors must pay to the producer is derived from the purchase price for class II plus 5 % of the basic price; whereas, to simplify matters, this calculation should be based on the average basic and purchase prices fixed for the 1987/88 year by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1927/87 (3);
Whereas, under Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/77, financial compensation cannot exceed the difference between the minimum purchase price referred to in Article 1 of the said Regulation and the prices obtained for the basic products in producer third countries; whereas, for the purposes of calculating this compensation and with a view to encouraging optimum marketing of lemon products, it would seem advisable to apply the full difference between these prices;
Whereas for the present marketing year the minimum purchase price for lemons and the amount of financial compensation have been fixed until 30 June by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1736/87 (4); whereas the information now available allows these prices to be fixed up to the end of the marketing year of this product;
Whereas Articles 119 (2) and 305 (2) of the Act of Accession provide that, from the first move towards alignment, the minimum prices applicable, as the case may be, in Spain and Portugal are to be aligned on the common minimum price in accordance with the mechanism provided for in Articles 70 and 238 of the said Act and the financial compensation applicable in Spain and Portugal respectively at each move towards alignment is to be that of the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 less the difference between, on the one hand the common minimum price and, on the other, the minimum prices applicable, as the case may be, in Spain and Portugal;
Whereas, because of the late publication of the amounts of the minimum price and financial compensation, the interested parties have been unable to conclude contracts for the first part of the 1987/88 marketing year by the specified time; whereas the dates specified in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1562/85 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1715/86 (6), should therefore be waived;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 1562/85, the event creating entitlement in the case of lemons sent for processing in the period from 1 June to 30 November is deemed to occur on 1 June and the conversion rate applying to the minimum price is the representative rate also valid on 1 June;
Whereas the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture in respect of fruit and vegetables have been adjusted with effect from 1 July 1987; whereas for economic reasons, these adjusted rates should be applied for the 1987/88 marketing year; whereas, for this purpose, the date of 1 June referred to above should be carried forward to 1 July;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and 93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, 2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Where a national standard transposing a harmonised standard, the reference of which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Union, covers one or more essential health and safety requirements set out in Annex II to Council Directive 89/686/EEC (2), equipment built in accordance with this standard is presumed to meet the basic health and safety requirements concerned.
(2) Pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 89/686/EEC, the Commission lodged a formal objection against the standard EN 1384:1996 ‘Helmets for equestrian activities’, harmonised under the Directive 89/686/EEC. The reference of the standard was first published in the OJ C 180 of 14.6.1997, plus the Amendment A1 published in the OJ C 190 of 10.8.2002. Meanwhile, a new version of the standard, EN 1384:2012, has been published by CEN and listed in the OJ C 395 of 20.12.2012; as from 30 April 2013, the presumption of conformity for the superseded standard EN 1384:1996 has expired.
(3) The new version now is harmonised and confers presumption of conformity; however, the standard has not been substantially changed. As the deficiencies of the standard have not been remedied by the new version, the Commission updated the formal objection against the standard EN 1384:2012.
(4) The formal objection is based on the failure of the standard which does not sufficiently cover the basic health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 and laid down in Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC and shows lower safety level compared to other helmet safety standards (such as the Snell standard or PAS 015 for equestrian helmets), in particular regarding shock absorption, penetration of the shell and helmet stability. Having examined standard EN 1384:2012 and after consulting experts, the Commission considers that particularly the following areas need improvement:
— shock absorption: most of comparable standards use more than an anvil and have higher energy levels,
— penetration of the shell: the drop height of the mass is only half of what is required in the Snell standard,
— side stability: there are no requirements for side stability, i.e. to manufacture a helmet strong enough to resist high side forces,
— area of protection: the temple areas need more consideration, and the ability to hear should not be affected,
— field of vision: there are no requirements for the field of vision, to ensure a good visibility during horse riding,
— helmet stability: a stability test as in PAS 015 could be included to ensure that the helmet is not able to move on the head during riding.
(5) Taking into consideration the abovementioned safety aspects to be improved, the standard EN 1384:2012 is not able to provide presumption of conformity with the basic health and safety requirements of the Directive 89/686/EEC. As a consequence, the reference of the standard EN 1384:2012 should be withdrawn from the OJ.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 became applicable on 1 January 2013. According to Article 26 of that Regulation Article 6(1) of Directive 89/686/EEC is deleted and references to the deleted provision shall be construed as reference to Article 11 of the Regulation.
(7) The European standardisation organisations, the European stakeholder organisations receiving Union financing and the personal protective equipment working group were consulted.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food (1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 (2) sets maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs.
(2) ‘Dioxins’ as referred to in this Regulation cover a group of 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (PCDD) congeners and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners, of which 17 are of toxicological concern. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 different congeners which can be divided into two groups according to their toxicological properties: a small number exhibit toxicological properties similar to dioxins and are therefore often termed ‘dioxin-like PCBs’. The majority do not exhibit dioxin-like toxicity but have a different toxicological profile.
(3) Each congener of dioxins or dioxin-like PCBs exhibits a different level of toxicity. In order to be able to sum up the toxicity of these different congeners, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been introduced to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. This means that the analytical results relating to all the individual dioxin and dioxin-like PCB congeners of toxicological concern are expressed in terms of a quantifiable unit, namely the ‘TCDD toxic equivalent’ (TEQ).
(4) On 30 May 2001 the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) adopted an Opinion on the Risk Assessment of Dioxins and Dioxin-like PCBs in Food, updating its Opinion of 22 November 2000 on this subject on the basis of new scientific information that had become available since the latter’s adoption (3). The SCF fixed a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Exposure estimates indicate that a considerable proportion of the Community population have a dietary intake in excess of the TWI. Certain population groups in some countries could be at higher risk owing to particular dietary habits.
(5) From a toxicological point of view, any level set should apply to both dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, but in 2001 maximum levels were set for dioxins only and not for dioxin-like PCBs, given the very limited data available at that time on the prevalence of dioxin-like PCBs. In the meantime, however, more data on the presence of dioxin-like PCBs have become available.
(6) According to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001, the Commission was to review the provisions on dioxins in the light of new data on the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, in particular with a view to the inclusion of dioxin-like PCBs in the levels to be set.
(7) All operators in the food and feed chain must continue to make all possible efforts and to do all that is necessary to limit the dioxins and PCBs present in feed and food. Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 accordingly provides that the maximum levels applicable should be further reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest with the aim of significantly reducing the maximum levels and possibly laying down maximum levels for other foodstuffs. Given the time necessary to obtain sufficient monitoring data to determine such significantly lower levels, that time-limit should be extended.
(8) It is proposed to set maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs expressed in World Health Organisation (WHO) toxic equivalents, using the WHO-TEFs as this is the most appropriate approach from a toxicological point of view. In order to ensure a smooth transition, for a transitional period the existing levels for dioxins should continue to apply in addition to the newly set levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The foodstuffs indicated in section 5 of Annex I must comply during that period with the maximum levels for dioxins and with the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 to dispensing with the separate maximum level for dioxins.
(9) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach throughout the Community. Commission Directive 2002/69/EC of 26 July 2002 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of dioxins and the determination of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs (4) provides that a lot shall be considered as non-compliant with the established maximum level if the analytical result confirmed by duplicate analysis and calculated as the mean of at least two separate determinations exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty. There are different possibilities to estimate the expanded uncertainty (5).
(10) In order to encourage a proactive approach to reducing the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs present in food and feed, action levels were set by Commission Recommendation 2002/201/EC of 4 March 2002 on the reduction of the presence of dioxins, furans and PCBs in feedingstuffs and foodstuffs (6). These action levels are a tool for competent authorities and operators to highlight those cases where it is appropriate to identify a source of contamination and to take measures to reduce or eliminate it. Since the sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are different, separate action levels should be determined for dioxins on the one hand and for dioxin-like PCBs on the other hand. Recommendation 2002/201/EC will therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) Derogations have been granted to Finland and Sweden to place on the market fish originating in the Baltic region and intended for consumption in the territory with dioxin levels higher than those set in point 5.2 of section 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001. Those Member States have fulfilled the conditions as regards the provision of information to consumers on dietary recommendations. Every year they have communicated the results of their monitoring of the levels of dioxins in fish from the Baltic region to the Commission and have reported on the measures to reduce human exposure to dioxins from the Baltic region.
(12) On the basis of the results of monitoring of levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs carried out by Finland and Sweden, the transitional period during which the derogations granted to those Member States apply should be extended, but those derogations should be limited to certain fish species. Those derogations apply to the maximum levels for dioxins and to the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs set in point 5.2 of section 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001.
(13) The reduction of human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs through food consumption is important and necessary to ensure consumer protection. As food contamination is directly related to feed contamination, an integrated approach must be adopted to reduce dioxin and dioxin-like PCB incidence throughout the food chain, i.e. from feed materials through food-producing animals to humans. A proactive approach is followed to actively reduce the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feed and food and consequently the maximum levels applicable should be reviewed within a defined period of time with the objective to set lower levels. Therefore consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 at the latest to significantly reducing the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
(14) Operators need to make efforts to step up their capacity effectively to remove dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs from marine oil. The significant lower level to which consideration shall be given by 31 December 2008, shall be based on the technical possibilities of the most effective decontamination procedure.
(15) As regards the establishment of maximum levels for other foodstuffs by 31 December 2008, particular attention shall be paid to the need to set specific lower maximum levels for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in foods for infants and young children in the light of the monitoring data obtained through the 2005, 2006 and 2007 programmes for monitoring dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in foods for infants and young children.
(16) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

In order to ensure a smooth transition, for a transitional period the existing levels for dioxins should continue to apply in addition to the newly set levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The foodstuffs indicated in section 5 of Annex\xa0I must comply during that period with the maximum levels for dioxins and with the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 to dispensing with the separate maximum level for dioxins.\n\n((9)) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach throughout the Community. Commission Directive 2002/69/EC of 26 July 2002 laying down the sampling methods and the methods of analysis for the official control of dioxins and the determination of dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs(4)provides that a lot shall be considered as non-compliant with the established maximum level if the analytical result confirmed by duplicate analysis and calculated as the mean of at least two separate determinations exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty. There are different possibilities to estimate the expanded uncertainty(5).\n\n((10)) In order to encourage a proactive approach to reducing the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs present in food and feed, action levels were set by Commission Recommendation 2002/201/EC of 4 March 2002 on the reduction of the presence of dioxins, furans and PCBs in feedingstuffs and foodstuffs(6). These action levels are a tool for competent authorities and operators to highlight those cases where it is appropriate to identify a source of contamination and to take measures to reduce or eliminate it. Since the sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are different, separate action levels should be determined for dioxins on the one hand and for dioxin-like PCBs on the other hand. Recommendation 2002/201/EC will therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) Derogations have been granted to Finland and Sweden to place on the market fish originating in the Baltic region and intended for consumption in the territory with dioxin levels higher than those set in point 5.2 of section 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001. Those Member States have fulfilled the conditions as regards the provision of information to consumers on dietary recommendations. Every year they have communicated the results of their monitoring of the levels of dioxins in fish from the Baltic region to the Commission and have reported on the measures to reduce human exposure to dioxins from the Baltic region.\n\n((12)) On the basis of the results of monitoring of levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs carried out by Finland and Sweden, the transitional period during which the derogations granted to those Member States apply should be extended, but those derogations should be limited to certain fish species. Those derogations apply to the maximum levels for dioxins and to the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs set in point 5.2 of section 5 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 466/2001.\n\n((13)) The reduction of human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs through food consumption is important and necessary to ensure consumer protection. As food contamination is directly related to feed contamination, an integrated approach must be adopted to reduce dioxin and dioxin-like PCB incidence throughout the food chain, i.e. from feed materials through food-producing animals to humans. A proactive approach is followed to actively reduce the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feed and food and consequently the maximum levels applicable should be reviewed within a defined period of time with the objective to set lower levels. Therefore consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 at the latest to significantly reducing the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.\n\n((14)) Operators need to make efforts to step up their capacity effectively to remove dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs from marine oil. The significant lower level to which consideration shall be given by 31 December 2008, shall be based on the technical possibilities of the most effective decontamination procedure.\n\n((15)) As regards the establishment of maximum levels for other foodstuffs by 31 December 2008, particular attention shall be paid to the need to set specific lower maximum levels for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in foods for infants and young children in the light of the monitoring data obtained through the 2005, 2006 and 2007 programmes for monitoring dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in foods for infants and young children.\n\n((16)) Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((17)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 466/2001 is amended as follows:\n1.\nArticle 1 is amended as follows:\n(a)\nParagraph 1a is replaced by the following:\n‘1a.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Finland and Sweden are authorised, for a transitional period extending to 31 December 2011, to place on their market salmon (\nSalmo salar\n), herring (\nClupea harengus\n), river lamprey (\nLampetra fluviatilis\n), trout (\nSalmo trutta\n), char (\nSalvelinus\nspp.) and roe of vendace (\nCoregonus albula\n) originating in the Baltic region and intended for consumption in their territory with levels of dioxins and/or levels of the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs higher than those set in point 5.2 of section 5 of Annex I, provided that a system is in place to ensure that consumers are fully informed of the dietary recommendations with regard to the restrictions on the consumption of these fish species from the Baltic region by identified vulnerable sections of the population in order to avoid potential health risks.\nBy 31 March each year, Finland and Sweden shall communicate to the Commission the results of their monitoring of the levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in fish from the Baltic region obtained in the preceding year and shall report on the measures taken to reduce human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish from the Baltic region.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 130s thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the first two action programmes of the European Communities on the environment (4) emphasize the importance for the Community of dealing with pollution of the seas in general and make provision inter alia for Community measures to deal with pollution caused by transport and shipping; whereas they specify that the task of protecting sea water constitutes a matter of priority with a view to maintaining vital ecological balances;
Whereas the third action programme of the European Communities on the environment (5) emphasizes that, in the event of an accident, the authorities in the Member States concerned must be able to intervene quickly, in a coordinated manner and with sufficient means;
Whereas the fourth environmental action programme of the European Communities (6) confirms that the control of pollution from oil spills remains a valid priority and, indeed, that the priority attributed to marine pollution is increasing; whereas it recognizes that considerable attention must be paid to other dangerous substances transported by sea, as well as to oil;
Whereas the fifth environmental action programme of the European Communities (7), on the one hand, refers to the need to improve the general state of preparation and capacity for intervention in the event of natural and technological disasters and, on the other, stresses the need to improve the means of intervention in view of the increased risks inherent in particular in dangerous transport operations, which in concrete terms involves improving and further upgrading mutual assistance procedures;
Whereas the Commission has participated, on behalf of the Community, in the negotiations to prepare an international cooperation agreement for the protection of the coasts and waters of the north-east Atlantic against pollution;
Whereas, as a result of those negotiations, the Cooperation Agreement for the protection of the coasts and waters of the north-east Atlantic against pollution was adopted on 17 October 1990 in Lisbon, and signed on behalf of the Community;
Whereas that Agreement fills a gap, as far as the northeast Atlantic is concerned, in international action relating to accidental marine pollution, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea being already covered by multilateral agreements for cooperation in case of accidental marine pollution;
Whereas it is desirable for the Community to approve that Agreement in order to play its part in achieving its objectives alongside Member States, especially in consideration of Council Decision 86/85/EEC of 6 March 1986 establishing a Community information system for the control and reduction of pollution caused by the spillage of hydrocarbons and other harmful substances at sea or in major inland waters (8),","{'title': '93/550/EEC: Council Decision of 20 October 1993 concerning the conclusion of the cooperation Agreement for the protection of the coasts and waters of the north-east Atlantic against pollution', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement for the protection of the coasts and waters of the north-east Atlantic against pollution, as adopted in Lisbon on 17 October 1990, is hereby approved on behalf of the European Economic Community.\n\nThe text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe President of the Council shall, on behalf of the European Economic Community, deposit the instrument of approval with the Government of Portugal as provided for in Article 24 (2) of the Agreement.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 20 October 1993.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (2), and in particular Article 18(7) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (3), and in particular Article 22(6) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC (4), and in particular Article 18 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Following the outbreak of avian influenza in south-eastern Asia in 2004, caused by a highly pathogenic strain of the virus, the Commission adopted several protection measures in relation to that disease. Those measures included in particular Commission Decision 2005/759/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries and the movement from third countries of birds accompanying their owners (5) and Commission Decision 2005/760/EC of 27 October 2005 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in certain third countries for the import of captive birds (6).
(2) Article 3 of Decision 2005/759/EC provides that, that Decision does not apply to the movement into the Community of live pet birds accompanying their owners from the third countries referred to in that Article. Croatia is presently not referred to in Article 3 of Decision 2005/759/EC and accordingly imports of pet birds accompanying their owners from that third country need to comply with the same import restrictions as those laid down in that Decision for other third countries. Croatia was one of the first countries in Europe to notify the Commission of cases of avian influenza found in wild birds and has been transparent in the way it handled further cases of that disease. No new cases of avian influenza has been detected lately in Croatia.
(3) In addition, Croatia has notified the Commission that the competent authorities of that country are now applying protection measures that are equivalent to those applied by the competent authorities of the Member States, as provided in Commission Decision 2006/115/EC of 17 February 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds in the Community and repealing Decisions 2006/86/EC, 2006/90/EC, 2006/91/EC, 2006/94/EC, 2006/104/EC and 2006/105/EC (7).
(4) As the risk for animal health in the Community posed by imports of pet birds from Croatia are therefore minimal, Croatia should be added to the list of third countries referred to in Article 3 of Decision 2005/759/EC.
(5) Decision 2005/759/EC currently is to apply until 31 July 2006. Since new cases of avian influenza have been reported in certain member countries of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the restrictions concerning the movements of pet birds accompanying their owners should be continued. It is therefore appropriate to extend the application of Decision 2005/759/EC until 31 December 2006.
(6) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on animal health and welfare (AHAW) will adopt a scientific opinion on the animal health and welfare risks associated with the import of wild birds other than poultry into the Community in October 2006. EFSA has been specifically asked to identify in its opinion possible tools and options which could reduce any identified risk related to the import of birds other than poultry. This opinion will guide the future policy of the EU on the animal health and welfare aspects of these imports.
(7) Decision 2005/760/EC is to apply until 31 July 2006. At this moment, a substantial amendment to the current rules laid down in the two Decisions 2005/759/EC and 2005/760/EC would mislead the operators and other stakeholders on the possible future development of the EU policy on this matter. In light of the current animal health situation regarding avian influenza and pending the intended adoption of the EFSA opinion in October, the restrictions relating to the imports of birds other than poultry should be continued. It is therefore appropriate to amend the date of application of that Decision until 31 December 2006.
(8) Decisions 2005/759/EC and 2005/760/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '27.7.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 205/28', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 25 July 2006\namending Decisions 2005/759/EC and 2005/760/EC as regards certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza and movements of certain live birds into the Community\n(notified under document number C(2006) 3303)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/522/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Following the outbreak of avian influenza in south-eastern Asia in 2004, caused by a highly pathogenic strain of the virus, the Commission adopted several protection measures in relation to that disease.

Whereas an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has occurred in Italy; whereas this outbreak is such as to constitute a danger to the livestock of the other Member States owing to the important volume of trade both in animals and fresh meat and in certain meat-based products;
Whereas following this outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, on 14 December 1984 the Commission adopted Decision 85/40/EEC on certain protective measures against foot-and-mouth disease in Italy ( (7);

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Member States of organisms harmful to plants or plant products (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 90/490/EEC (2), and in particular Article 14 (3), second and third indents, thereof,
Having regard to the requests made by Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom,
Whereas under the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, because of the risk of introducing harmful organisms, wood of conifers which meets the descriptions in CN code ex 4407 10, originating in Canada, China, Japan, Korea or the USA may not be introduced into the Community, unless it is properly kiln-dried and identified as such;
Whereas, however, Article 14 (3), second indent, of Directive 77/93/EEC permits derogations from that rule, provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms;
Whereas, moreover, Article 14 (3), third indent, of the abovementioned Directive permits derogations from the rule requiring a phytosanitary certificate, if equivalent safeguards are given and provided that it is established that there is no risk of spreading harmful organisms;
Whereas wood of conifers originating in Canada is currently introduced into the Community; whereas in the case of sawn wood, phytosanitary certificates are not generally issued in that country; whereas it appears that kiln-drying capacity is at present limited in Canada;
Whereas, in respect of Canada, the Commission has established, on the basis of the information available at present, that an officially approved and monitored programme of issuing 'certificates of debarking and grub hole control' has been set up to ensure proper debarking and to reduce the risk from harmful organisms; whereas the risk of spreading harmful organisms is reduced provided that the wood is accompanied by a 'Certificate of Debarking and Grub Hole Control' issued under that programme;
Whereas the Commission will ensure that Canada makes available all technical information necessary to assess the functioning of the Debarking and Grub Hole Control Certificate Programme;
Whereas the Member States should therefore be authorized to provide for derogations under Article 14 (3), second and third indents, of Directive 77/93/EEC in respect of sawn wood of conifers originating in Canada for a limited period;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'title': '90/505/EEC: Commission Decision of 21 September 1990 authorizing certain Member States to provide for derogations from certain provisions of Council Directive 77/93/EEC in respect of sawn wood of conifers originating in Canada', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

(2007/640/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(8) thereof,
Having regard to the Recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. The Stability and Growth Pact includes Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) which was adopted to further the prompt correction of excessive general government deficits.
(3) By Council Decision 2005/185/EC (2), it was decided, following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, that an excessive deficit existed in the Czech Republic.
(4) On 5 July 2004, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, the Council, based on a recommendation from the Commission, adopted a recommendation to the Czech authorities with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end as rapidly as possible and to taking action in a medium-term framework to achieve the objective of bringing the deficit below 3 % of GDP by 2008 in a credible and sustainable manner, in accordance with the path for deficit reduction specified in the convergence programme submitted by the authorities in May 2004 and endorsed in the Council Opinion of 5 July 2004 on the Convergence Programme of the Czech Republic, 2004-2007 (3), with the following intermediate annual targets: 5,3 % of GDP in 2004, 4,7 % of GDP in 2005, 3,8 % of GDP in 2006, 3,3 % of GDP in 2007. The Council established the deadline of 5 November 2004 to take effective action ‘regarding the measures envisaged to achieve the 2005 deficit target’. The Czech Republic agreed to make the recommendation public.
(5) After the expiry of the deadline of 5 November 2004, the Commission concluded, in its Communication to the Council of 14 December 2004 (4), that no further steps were necessary under the excessive deficit procedure for the Czech Republic as the Czech government had taken effective action regarding the measures envisaged to achieve the 2005 deficit target. The November 2005 update of the convergence programme indicated a deficit of 2,7 % of GDP for 2008 which was endorsed by the Council on 24 January 2006.
(6) The assessment of the action taken by the Czech Republic to correct the excessive deficit by 2008 in response to the Council recommendation under Article 104(7) leads to the following conclusions:
— on 15 March 2007, the Czech Republic submitted the most recent update of the convergence programme, covering the period until 2009. The programme contained the following annual deficit projections: 4,0 % of GDP for 2007, 3,5 % of GDP for 2008 and 3,2 % of GDP for 2009. The programme also included an additional ‘declaration of the new government’ aiming to reduce the general deficit to 3,2 % of GDP in 2008 and 2,8 % of GDP in 2009 based on a wide range of as yet unknown policy measures,
— the Commission services’ spring 2007 forecast, which projects that the deficit will reach 3,9 % of GDP and 3,6 % of GDP in 2007 and 2008 respectively on a no-policy change basis, confirms that, on current policies, the targets set in the Council recommendation under Article 104(7) for 2007 (3,3 % of GDP) and 2008 (below 3 % of GDP) will be missed. In structural terms (i.e. in cyclically-adjusted terms net of one-off and other temporary measures), the deficit would widen by 1 percentage points of GDP in 2007, after deteriorations in both 2005 and 2006,
— the higher 2007 deficit comes against much stronger growth than forecast at the time of the Council recommendation and is mainly due to increases in social spending decided before the 2006 parliamentary elections. The higher 2007 deficit is projected to occur against the background of much lower deficits in the preceding years than foreseen in the Council recommendation. This was due mainly to better than expected growth rather than durable cuts in expenditure.
(7) This leads to the conclusion that, while the Czech Republic has so far overachieved the budgetary targets for 2004-2006 of the consolidation path set in the Council recommendation of 5 July 2004, the 2007 deficit will be well above the target set by the Council and the 2008 deficit will on current policies clearly exceed the 3 % of GDP threshold. The Czech authorities’ budgetary targets are not in line with the recommendations of the Council for a correction of the excessive deficit by the 2008 deadline.

The programme contained the following annual deficit projections: 4,0\xa0% of GDP for 2007, 3,5\xa0% of GDP for 2008 and 3,2\xa0% of GDP for 2009. The programme also included an additional ‘declaration of the new government’ aiming to reduce the general deficit to 3,2\xa0% of GDP in 2008 and 2,8\xa0% of GDP in 2009 based on a wide range of as yet unknown policy measures,—the Commission services’ spring 2007 forecast, which projects that the deficit will reach 3,9\xa0% of GDP and 3,6\xa0% of GDP in 2007 and 2008 respectively on a no-policy change basis, confirms that, on current policies, the targets set in the Council recommendation under Article 104(7) for 2007 (3,3\xa0% of GDP) and 2008 (below 3\xa0% of GDP) will be missed. In structural terms (i.e. in cyclically-adjusted terms net of one-off and other temporary measures), the deficit would widen by 1percentage points of GDP in 2007, after deteriorations in both 2005 and 2006,—the higher 2007 deficit comes against much stronger growth than forecast at the time of the Council recommendation and is mainly due to increases in social spending decided before the 2006 parliamentary elections.

Whereas it is in particular necessary to allow all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas it is appropriate to take the necessary measures to ensure efficient Community administration of these tariff quotas while offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are being used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning, in particular, the administration of quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1255/90 of 7 May 1990 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain quality wines and sparkling wines, originating in Austria', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 71/118/EEC of 15 February 1971 on health problems affecting the production and placing on the market of fresh poultrymeat (1), as last amended by Directive 96/23/EC (2), and in particular Article 14 thereof, and to the corresponding provisions of the other Directives in the veterinary field concerning health rules and the health requirements applying to imports of various animal species or products of animal origin,
Whereas the Commission should adopt the general implementing rules establishing the conditions under which on-the-spot checks in the veterinary field in third countries should take place, in collaboration with the Member States;
Whereas some rules relating to on-the-spot checks by Commission experts should be common to all the legislation in this field; whereas, therefore, they should be laid down in a single Decision; whereas, however, Commission Decision 86/474/EEC of 11 September 1986 on the implementation of the on-the-spot inspections to be carried out in respect of the importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat (3) should continue to apply;
Whereas application of the plans that third countries must submit pursuant to Council Directive 92/117/EEC of 17 December 1992 concerning measures for protection against specified zoonoses and specified zoonotic agents in animals and products of animal origin in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne infections and intoxications (4), as last amended by Directive 97/22/EC (5), should be verified during the on-the-spot checks;
Whereas, when approved establishments or those undergoing approval for the purpose of exporting fresh meat to the Community are being inspected, the slaughtering conditions should also be checked in accordance with Article 15 of Council Directive 93/119/EC of 22 December 1993 on the protection of animals at the time of slaughter or killings (6);
Whereas, in the interests of efficiency, deadlines should be established for the despatch by the Commission of the results of on-the-spot checks to the third countries in which the checks were undertaken;
Whereas, where this is necessary to ensure the uniform application of the Community legislation, the on-the-spot checks should be included in programmes established after discussion with the Member States and an exchange of views in the Standing Veterinary Committee;
Whereas that collaboration should continue during the on-the-spot checks carried out by Commission experts, accompanied by experts of the Member States appointed by the Commission; whereas the Member States' experts should be subject to certain obligations and be reimbursed their travel and subsistence expenses;
Whereas, following on-the-spot checks, it is necessary to ensure that Member States are informed of the results and for appropriate measures to be proposed in accordance with Community legislation;
Whereas, in the interests of transparency, the European Parliament, the consumer and the producer should be kept informed within the limits of the Treaty and in particular the need to respect the obligation of professional secrecy laid down in Article 214 of the Treaty, of the findings of, and recommendations for action following from, the on-the-spot checks;
Whereas, the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and in particular Article 8 and Annex C, paragraph l(d), requires that the confidentiality of information arising from the operation of control, inspection and approval procedures is respected in a way that legitimate commercial interests are protected;
Whereas, in the interests of clarity, Commission Decision 97/134/EC (7) should be repealed;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 37 and 299(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3),
Having regard to the opinion of Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations(4) lays down rural development measures that may be granted Community support and sets out the conditions for obtaining such support. That Regulation acknowledges that, in the case of the outermost regions, adjustments and derogations may be envisaged to meet the specific needs of those regions.
(2) Article 299(2) of the Treaty recognises, moreover, the constraints affecting the outermost regions, which include the Azores and Madeira.
(3) Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92(5) seeks to remedy the handicaps due to the remote and insular nature of these regions.
(4) The structures of certain agricultural holdings or processing and marketing enterprises located in these regions show serious shortcomings and are beset with specific difficulties. Provision should accordingly be made for derogations for certain types of investments from the provisions limiting or preventing the grant of some structural aid provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(5) Article 29(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 restricts the grant of forestry support to forests and wooded areas belonging to private owners and municipalities and associations thereof. Part of the forests and wooded areas located in these regions belong to public authorities other than municipalities. Under these circumstances, the conditions laid down in the said Article should be made more flexible.
(6) The Community financial contribution for three of the accompanying measures referred to in Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 may amount in the outermost regions to up to 85 % of the total eligible cost. On the other hand, in accordance with the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 47(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999, the Community financial contribution for agri-environmental measures, which constitutes the fourth accompanying measure, shall be limited to 75 % for all areas covered by Objective 1. In view of the importance attributed to agri-environment within the context of rural development, the rate of the Community financial contribution should be harmonised for all accompanying measures in the outermost regions.
(7) Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 and the Annex thereto determine the maximum amounts per year eligible for Community agri-environmental aid. To take into account the specific environmental situation of certain very sensitive pasture areas in the Azores and the preservation of the landscape and traditional features of agricultural land, in particular the areas of terrace cultivation in Madeira, provision should be made for the possibility, in the case of certain specific measures, of increasing those amounts up to twofold.
(8) Pursuant to Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(6), each plan, Community support framework, operational programme and single programming document shall cover a period of seven years, and the programming period shall begin on 1 January 2000. In the interests of cohesiveness and to avoid discrimination between beneficiaries of the same programme, the derogations provided for in this Regulation must, exceptionally, be applicable to the whole programming period,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1449/2001 of 28 June 2001 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products as regards the structural measures', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 1600/92 is hereby amended as follows:\n\nThe following Article 32 shall be inserted in Section 1 of Title IV: ""Article 32\n\n1.

(3) For that determination all the characteristics of the products concerned have to be taken into account.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) A review of the remuneration of Officials and Other Servants carried out on the basis of a report by the Commission has shown that the remuneration and pensions of officials and other servants of the Communities should be adjusted under the 2000 annual review.
(2) The annual adjustment in respect of 2001 may entail the establishment before 31 December 2001 of new weightings with retroactive effect from 1 July 2001.
(3) These new weightings could lead to retroactive adjustments to remuneration and pensions (positive or negative) in respect of the period of 2001 for which payments have already been made on the basis of this Regulation.
(4) Provisions should therefore be made for the payment of arrears in the event of an upward adjustment as a result of these weightings or for the recovery of sums overpaid in the event of a downward adjustment for the period between the effective date and the date of entry into force of the Council's decision on the annual adjustment in respect of 2001.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 461/2004 (2) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8, 11(3), 21 and 22(c) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Measures in force
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 990/2004 (3) the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 151/2003 (4) imposing anti-dumping measures on imports of certain grain oriented electrical sheets (‘the product concerned’) originating in the Russian Federation (‘Russia’). The rate of the duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, is set for imports of the product concerned at 40,1 % manufactured by the Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation and at 14,7 % manufactured by the OOO Viz Stal.
2.   Investigation
(2) On 20 March 2004 the Commission announced through the publication of a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (5) the initiation of a partial interim review of the measures in force (‘the measures’) pursuant to Articles 11(3) and 22(c) of the basic Regulation.
(3) The review was launched at the initiative of the Commission in order to examine whether, as a consequence of the enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘Enlargement’) and, bearing in mind the aspect of Community interest, there is a need to adapt the measures in order to avoid a sudden and excessively negative effect on all interested parties including users, distributors and consumers.
(4) All interested parties, including the Community industry, associations of producers or users in the Community, exporters/producers in the countries concerned, importers and their associations and the relevant authorities of the countries concerned as well as interested parties in the ten new Member States which acceded to the European Union on 1 May 2004 (‘the EU10’) were advised of the initiation of the investigation and were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing, to submit information and to provide supporting evidence within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. All interested parties who so requested and showed that there were reasons why they should be heard were granted a hearing.
3.   Result of the investigation
(5) As set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 990/2004, the investigation concluded that it is in the Community interest to adapt the existing measures, provided that such adaptation does not significantly undermine the desired level of trade defence.
4.   Undertakings
(6) In accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) 990/2004 the Commission, in conformity with Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation, suggested undertakings to the companies concerned. As a result, undertakings were subsequently offered by (i) one exporting producer of the product concerned in Russia (Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation) jointly with a company in Switzerland (Stinol AG) and (ii) a second exporting producer of the product concerned in Russia (OOO Viz Stal) jointly with its related company Duferco S.A. in Switzerland.
(7) It should be noted that, in application of Article 22(c) of the basic Regulation, these undertakings are considered as special measures since, in accordance with the conclusions of Regulation (EC) 990/2004, they are not directly equivalent to an anti-dumping duty.
(8) Nevertheless, in conformity with Regulation (EC) 990/2004, the undertakings oblige each individual producing exporter to respect the import ceilings and, in order that the undertakings can be monitored, the exporting producers concerned have also agreed to broadly respect their traditional selling patterns to individual customers in the EU10. The exporting producers are also aware that if it is found that these sales patterns change significantly, or that the undertakings become in any way difficult or impossible to monitor, the Commission is entitled to withdraw acceptance of the company’s undertaking resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in its place, or it may adjust the level of the ceiling, or it may take other remedial action.
(9) It is also a condition of the undertakings that if they are breached in any way, the Commission will be entitled to withdraw acceptance thereof resulting in definitive anti-dumping duties being imposed in their place.
(10) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community, meaning that the undertakings can be monitored effectively by the Commission.
(11) In order that the Commission can monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertakings, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to an undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional upon the presentation of an invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) 990/2004. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
(12) In view of all the above, the offers of undertakings are considered acceptable.
(13) The acceptance of the undertakings is limited to an initial period of six months without prejudice to the normal duration of the measures and they shall lapse after this period, unless the Commission considers it is appropriate to extend period of application of special measures for next six months.
B.   REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(14) In view of the unusual circumstances of this case and the inherent risk of breaches of undertakings caused by the price differences between the EU10 and the EU15 and their short term character, it is considered that sufficient grounds exist to make certain imports of the product concerned subject to registration for a maximum period of nine months in accordance with Article 14 (5) of the basic Regulation.
(15) Customs authorities are therefore directed to take the appropriate steps to register imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Russia exported by the companies which have offered acceptable undertakings and for which benefit from the exemption to the anti-dumping duties is sought.
(16) In the event of a finding of a breach of the undertakings, duties may be levied retroactively on goods entered into free circulation in the Community from the date of the breach of the undertaking,","{'header': '20.5.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 183/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1000/2004\nof 18 May 2004\naccepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain grain oriented electrical sheets and strips of silicon-electrical steel with a width of more than 500 mm originating in the Russian Federation and making imports of certain grain oriented electrical sheets originating in the Russian Federation subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertakings offered by the exporting producers mentioned below, in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of grain oriented cold-rolled sheets and strips of silicon-electrical steel with a width of more than 500 mm originating in Russia are hereby accepted:\nCountry\nCompany\nTaric Additional Code\nRussian Federation\nProduced by Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation, Lipetsk, Russia, and sold by Stinol AG, Lugano, Switzerland, to its first customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA524\nRussian Federation\nProduced by OOO Viz Stal, Ekaterinburg, Russia, and sold by Duferco SA, Lugano, Switzerland, to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA525'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community of grain oriented cold-rolled sheets and strips of silicon-electrical steel with a width of more than 500 mm originating in Russia and falling within CN code 7225\xa011\xa000 (sheets of a width of 600 mm or more) and ex\xa07226\xa011\xa000 (sheets of a width of more than 500 mm but less than 600 mm) produced and sold by the companies listed in Article 1 for which an exemption to the anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 990/2004 is sought.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day after its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\nand shall remain in force for a period of six months.'}]}"

of 23 October 2000
including an active substance (bentazone) in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2000/10/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), laid down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter referred to as ""the Directive""). Pursuant to that Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), laid down the list of active substances of plant protection products to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to the Directive.
(2) In accordance with Article 5(1) of the Directive, an active substance should be included in Annex I if it may be expected that neither the use of, nor residues from, plant protection products containing that active substance will have any harmful effects on human or animal health or on groundwater or any unacceptable influence on the environment.
(3) Such an active substance may be included in Annex I for a period not exceeding 10 years.
(4) For bentazone the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a number of uses proposed by the notifiers. Germany was designated as rapporteur Member State under Regulation (EC) No 933/94 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. It submitted the relevant assessment report and recommendation to the Commission on 13 November 1996, in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(5) The assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 13 July 2000 in the format of the Commission review report for bentazone.
(6) The dossier and the information from the review have also been submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants for consultation. The Scientific Committee for Plants in its opinion(7) confirmed that the substance can be used without unacceptable risk but noted that Member States should assess the leaching potential to groundwater in particularly vulnerable locations and in rice cultures.
(7) It has appeared from the assessments made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined. It is appropriate therefore to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the granting, varying or withdrawing, as appropriate, of the authorisations of plant protection products containing bentazone can be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Directive.
(8) Article 8(2) of the Directive provides that after inclusion of an active substance in its Annex I, Member States shall, within a prescribed period, grant, vary or withdraw, as appropriate, the authorisations of the plant protection products containing the active substance. In particular, Articles 4(1) and 13(1) of the Directive require that plant protection products are not authorised unless account is taken of the conditions associated with the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I and the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI on the basis of a dossier satisfying the data requirements laid down in its Article 13.
(9) Before inclusion, a reasonable deadline is necessary to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion. Moreover, after inclusion, a reasonable period is necessary for the Member States to implement the Directive and in particular to vary or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations or grant new authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive. For plant protection products containing several active substances, the complete evaluation on the basis of the uniform principles can only be carried out when all the active substances concerned have been included in Annex I to the Directive.
(10) It is appropriate to provide that the finalised review report (except for confidential information in the meaning of Article 14 of the Directive) is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.
(11) The review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive, where these principles refer to the evaluation of the Annex II data which were submitted for the purpose of the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to the Directive.
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2000/68/EC of 23 October 2000 including an active substance (bentazone) in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBentazone is hereby designated as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For emamectin the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2007/669/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 23 June 2006 an application from Syngenta Crop Protection AG for the inclusion of the active substance emamectin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2007/669/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 6 March 2008.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion (4) on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance emamectin on 13 November 2012. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 16 July 2013 in the format of the Commission review report for emamectin.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing emamectin may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve emamectin.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing emamectin. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

It is therefore appropriate to approve emamectin.\n\n((6)) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n\n((7)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n\n((8)) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing emamectin. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((9)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(5)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((10)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances(6)should be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nApproval of active substance\nThe active substance emamectin, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Re-evaluation of plant protection products', 'text': 'Article 2\nRe-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing emamectin as an active substance by 31 October 2014.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing emamectin as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances, all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 30 April 2014 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 911/2001(2), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001(3) lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported, the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds.
(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Shelled almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts in shell can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) Compared with other fruit and vegetables, nuts are relatively easy to store. Export refunds can accordingly be fixed for longer periods with a view to rational management of the arrangements.
(9) The application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation, and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade, gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables, quotas should be fixed for each product.
(11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1007/2002(5), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(7), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(13) Owing to the market situation, in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports, the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1, A 2 and A 3 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.
(14) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund, taking account in particular of their perishability.

Whereas, pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 430/87, the maximum import levy for manioc and similar products originating in third countries which are not contracting parties to GATT, other than the People's Republic of China, is 6 % for certain quantities laid down in the case of (a) products used for purposes other than human consumption and (b) products of the types used for human consumption; whereas the detailed implementing rules concerned, as last adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 983/89 (3), should be consolidated and adjusted in the light of the experience gained;
Whereas in particular it is advisable to make sure that the origin of the products is correct by requiring that certain documents issued by the countries concerned be presented in order to obtain an import licence; whereas under arrangements introduced several years ago, one of the requirements, when applying for an import licence for products originating in Vietnam, is that a certificate issued on the initiative of the exporting country should be presented;
Whereas, moreover, it is advisable, in order to discourage operators from applying for abnormally high quantities, to specify that the person applying for an import licence should provide proof of the quantities loaded and consigned to the Community; whereas it is also advisable to provide for a maximum quantity per application, and to specify that the quantity applied for may in no case exceed that for which the proof referred to above has been presented;
Whereas the supplementary detailed rules normally applicable to the management of such quotas should also be set out, in particular those regarding the lodging of applications, the issuing of licences and the monitoring of actual imports; whereas those detailed rules either supplement or derogate from the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1903/89 (5), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 891/89 of 5 April 1989 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 990/89 (7);

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1592/96 (2), lays down the basic rules for the management of the market in that sector; whereas, in particular, Article 1 (6) thereof lays down that the wine year lasts from 1 September to 31 August;
Whereas, by virtue of the abovementioned Act of Accession, the common organization of the market in wine has applied in Austria since the moment of accession; whereas, however, the Commission, by Regulation (EC) No 1834/95 of 26 July 1995 on transitional measures applicable in Austria in the wine-growing sector (3), postponed the whole application of important market management measures;
Whereas the compulsory distillation measures imposed on Community table wine producers pursuant to Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 require the setting up of a large administrative organization; whereas, moreover, if the measure in question were to be initiated in Austria its impact would be negligible given the small proportion of table wine by comparison with quality wine; whereas, therefore, producers should be exempted from that distillation obligation for the 1996/97 wine year; whereas, however, given that they could be eligible for other forms of voluntary distillation, a distillation price and an ad hoc wine quantity should be fixed for Austrian producers taking account of the possibility that compulsory distillation may not be applied;
Whereas, to smooth the transition from the former national arrangements to the Community arrangements and to ensure stability on the market in Austrian wines, wine producers in Austria should be exempted from the distillation obligation laid down in Articles 35 and 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 and at the same time special provisions appropriate to that situation should be adopted;
Whereas, to respond to the current absence of suitable distillation structures for wine-making by-products in Austria, that Member State's producers should be exempted from the distillation obligation laid down by Article 35 of the above Regulation and at the same time, in order to establish equitable treatment for all Community producers, they should be obliged to withdraw those by-products under supervision;
Whereas the overpressing of grapes, whether crushed or not, and of wine lees should also be avoided; whereas the marcs and lees withdrawn under supervision must present the minimum characteristics required by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3105/88 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2365/95 (5); whereas the impact of that operation should be equivalent to that of normal legal instruments;
Whereas the development of the situation on the Austrian wine market, and in particular the current phase of transition to the Community arrangements, should be monitored with a view to facilitating that transition;

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes carbaryl.
(3) For carbaryl the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For carbaryl the rapporteur Member State was Spain and all relevant information was submitted on 29 April 2004.
(4) The assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 12 May 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbaryl (4). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 29 September 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for carbaryl.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns were identified. In particular based on the available data it has not been demonstrated that the consumer exposure is acceptable. The information available indicates concerns for metabolites which are at the same level of toxicity as the active substance, and their presence at levels which might be of toxicological concerns can not be excluded. Moreover there are concerns on potential carcinogenic properties of the active substance. There is also a high long-term risk for insectivorous birds and a high acute risk to herbivorous mammals, a high acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms and a high risk for beneficial arthropods.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments advanced, the above concerns remained unsolved, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing carbaryl satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Carbaryl should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing carbaryl are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing carbaryl, should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.
(10) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for carbaryl according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '25.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 133/40', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 21 May 2007\nconcerning the non-inclusion of carbaryl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document number C(2007) 2093)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/355/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 703/2001(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

For carbaryl the rapporteur Member State was Spain and all relevant information was submitted on 29 April 2004.\n\n((4)) The assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 12 May 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance carbaryl(4). This report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 29 September 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for carbaryl.\n\n((5)) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns were identified. In particular based on the available data it has not been demonstrated that the consumer exposure is acceptable. The information available indicates concerns for metabolites which are at the same level of toxicity as the active substance, and their presence at levels which might be of toxicological concerns can not be excluded. Moreover there are concerns on potential carcinogenic properties of the active substance. There is also a high long-term risk for insectivorous birds and a high acute risk to herbivorous mammals, a high acute and long-term risk to aquatic organisms and a high risk for beneficial arthropods.\n\n((6)) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments advanced, the above concerns remained unsolved, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing carbaryl satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((7)) Carbaryl should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((8)) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing carbaryl are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\n\n((9)) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing carbaryl, should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.\n\n((10)) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for carbaryl according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nCarbaryl shall not be included as an active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall ensure that:\n(a)\nauthorisations for plant protection products containing carbaryl are withdrawn by 21 November 2007;\n(b)\nno authorisations for plant protection products containing carbaryl are granted or renewed from the date of publication of this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nAny period of grace granted by Member States in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC, shall be as short as possible and shall expire 21 November 2008 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

","COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 2253/84
of 31 July 1984
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on certain imports of certain sodium carbonate originating in the United States of America and accepting undertakings in respect of other imports of the same product
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 20 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In March 1984 the Commission received a request for a review of the existing anti-dumping measures (3) lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Associations (CEFIC) on behalf of Belgian, British, Dutch, French, German and Italian producers of dense sodium carbonate whose collective output constitutes practically all Community production of the product in question. The request for a review contained evidence of renewed dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4), the re-opening of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of dense sodium carbonate originating in the United States of America, falling within subheading 28.42 A ex II of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 28.42-31, and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) The majority of the known exporters and all importers made their views known in writing and have requested and have been granted hearings.
(4) Submissions were made by the United Kingdom Glass Manufacturers' Federation and the Food Manufacturers' Federation of the United Kingdom.
(5) For the the purpose of a preliminary determination, the Commission requested and received all necessary detailed written submissions from the complainant Community producers, the exporters and the importers and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
B. Normal value
(6) Normal value was provisionally determined on the basis of the domestic prices of those producers who exported to the EEC.
C Export price
(7) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(8) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. This was especially the case for differences in conditions and terms of sale, in particular delivery and payment conditions. The necessary adjustments were made where claims in this area could be satisfactorily demonstrated; all comparisons were made at ex works level on the basis of cash payment.
E. Margins
(9) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of Allied Chemical Corporation, Texasgulf Chemicals Company and Tenneco Minerals Company, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
These margins vary according to the exporter, the weighted average margin for each of the exporters investigated being as follows:
Allied Chemical Corporation 34,25 %
Texasgulf Chemicals Company 15,87 %
Tenneco Minerals Company in excess of 40 %
(10) For those exporters who neither replied to the Commission's questionnaire nor made themselves known otherwise in the course of the preliminary investigation, dumping was determined on the basis of the facts available. In this connection the Commission considered that the results of its investigation provided an accurate basis for determination of the level of dumping and that it would constitute a bonus for non-cooperation to assume that the dumping margin for these exporters was any lower than the highest dumping margin determined with regard to an exporter who had cooperated in the investigation. For these reasons it is considered appropriate to use this latter dumping margin for this group of exporters.
F. Injury
(11) With regard to injury the Commission investigated the period 1 January 1982 to 31 March 1984, since the years 1979 to 1981 had been investigated during the proceeding which led to the measures referred to above at present in force.
(12) With regard to imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that quantities of dense sodium carbonate imported into the Community from the United States of America totalled 81 333 tonnes in 1982 decreasing to 48 263 tonnes in 1983, as a result of the anti-dumping measures taken in the latter part of 1982, only to increase again in the first quarter of 1984 to 24 064 tonnes which indicates that the total quantity for the year may well be in excess of the 1983 level. Sales in the Community of these imports in terms of tonnage developed accordingly. In consequence, the share of the Community market of bulk dense sodium carbonate represented by dumped imports was 3,70 % immediately prior to the initiation of the previous investigation, decreasing to 2,00 % in 1982, rising to 2,29 % in 1983, to return almost to its former level at 3,12 % in the first quarter of 1984.
(13) The corresponding shares for that part of the Community most affected by these dumped imports were 17,20 % for the first half of 1982, 9,13 and 11,31 % for 1982 and 1983 respectively, increasing once more to 16,08 % in the first quarter of 1984. It was furthermore established that the resale prices of these imports were lower than those required to cover the costs of the Community producer mainly implicated and provide a reasonable profit.
(14) The consequent impact on the Community industry as a whole has been a fall in production by about 5 % since 1982. Since no significant stocks of the product are kept by Community producers, sales decreased at the same rate as production. The market share held by the Community industry fell in accordance with the increase in market shares registered for dumped imports from the United States of America, particularly affecting that part of the Community market in which these imports are concentrated. The current figures concerning capacity utilization show an improvement since 1982 but this has been due to substantial reductions in overall capacity leading to an increased use of the production capacities remaining.
(15) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as stagnation of demand and the volume of other imports.
Although in previous years demand had declined considerably, no further noticeable decrease occurred during the period investigated.
As to imports of dense sodium carbonate from other countries, namely from eastern Europe, it has been difficult to establish meaningful figures because the Community import statistics do not distinguish between imports of dense sodium carbonate and other forms of sodium carbonate. According to the best evidence, these imports, unlike those originating in the United States of America, are evenly spread over the whole Community market and their impact is thereby felt to a lesser extent. In any case, the quantities involved are estimated to be below those subject to this proceeding. (16) All these considerations taken together led the Commission to the determination that the effects of the dumped imports of dense sodium carbonate originating in the United States, taken in isolation, have to be considered as causing material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interest
(17) The consumers referred to in paragraph 4 expressed themselves in favour of a continuation of imports of dense soidium carbonate originating in the United States of America so as to give them an alternative source of supply and thus increase competition among suppliers.
(18) The Commission has considered this point of view and the Community interest as a whole. It is in favour of competition from as many sources as possible on the Community market and more specifically that part of the Community market mostly affected. Hoever, in view of difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken. In order to prevent further injury being caused during the remainder of the proceeding, this action should take the form of a provisional anti-dumping duty.
H. Undertakings
(19) In the course of the investigation Allied Chemical Corporation, FMC Corporation, Tenneco Minerals Company, and Texasgulf Chemicals Company offered undertakings concerning exports to the Community of dense sodium carbonate.
The effect of the undertakings offered by Allied Chemical Corporation and Texasgulf Chemicals Company will be to increase sales prices in the Community to the level which the Commission, having taken into account the selling price necessary to provide an adequate return to Community producers, considered necessary to eliminate injury. These increases in no case exceed the dumping margins found during the investigation.
In these circumstances, these undertakings are considered acceptable. No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee.
The undertakings offered by Tenneco Minerals Company was found unacceptable because, in view of its special features, its implementation could not have been satisfactorily monitored and could have led to controversy.
A decision on the acceptability of the undertaking offered by FMC Corporation will be taken at a later stage in the proceeding.
I. Rate of duty
(20) Having regard to the extent of injury caused, the rate of provisional duty for imports not covered by the undertakings should be less than the dumping margins provisionally established but adequate to remove the injury caused; this duty should be levied in addition to the definitive duty currently applicable.
(21) In conformity with the provisions of the anti-dumping Regulation which provides for the possibility of taking provisional measures, it is appropriate to impose a supplementary provisional duty. The amount of this provisional duty is an additional 44,34 ECU per tonne for imports of dense sodium carbonate from the United States of America.
(22) A period should be fixed within which the parties concerned may, following the imposition of the provisional duty, make their views known and apply to be heard orally by the Commission,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2253/84 of 31 July 1984 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on certain imports of certain sodium carbonate originating in the United States of America and accepting undertakings in respect of other imports of the same product', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required pursuant to Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopts a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
