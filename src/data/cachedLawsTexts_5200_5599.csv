Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (2) lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies.
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 (3) lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention.
(3) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 31 443 tonnes of barley held by the Czech intervention agency.
(4) Special procedures must be laid down to ensure that the operations and their monitoring are properly effected. To that end, provision should be made for a security lodgement scheme which ensures that aims are met while avoiding excessive costs for the operators. Derogations should accordingly be made to certain rules, in particular those laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93.
(5) To forestall reimportation, exports under this invitation to tender should be limited to certain third countries.
(6) Article 7(2a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 allows the successful exporting tenderer to be reimbursed the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the actual place of exit, up to a certain ceiling. In view of the Czech Republic’s geographical location, this provision should be applied.
(7) With a view to modernising the management of the system, provision should be made for the electronic transmission of the information required by the Commission.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'header': '24.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 219/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1375/2005\nof 23 August 2005\nopening a standing invitation to tender for the export of barley held by the Czech intervention agency', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93(2)lays down the procedure and conditions for the disposal of cereals held by intervention agencies.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92(3)lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention.\n\n((3)) Given the current market situation, a standing invitation to tender should be opened for the export of 31\xa0443 tonnes of barley held by the Czech intervention agency.\n\n((4)) Special procedures must be laid down to ensure that the operations and their monitoring are properly effected.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 23(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2000/29/EC, a financial contribution from the Community may be granted to Member States to cover expenditure relating directly to the necessary measures which have been taken or are planned to be taken for the purpose of combating harmful organisms introduced from third countries or from other areas in the Community, in order to eradicate or, if that is not possible, to contain them.
(2) By Commission Decisions 2001/811/EC (2), 2002/889/EC (3), 2003/787/EC (4) and 2004/772/EC (5), a financial contribution from the Community was already granted to Portugal for measures aiming at the control of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (pinewood nematode), hereinafter ‘PWN’, in the years 1999-2003, that is for the maximum duration possible. Starting from 2003 a ‘mid-term eradication plan’ was implemented by Portugal to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating it.
(3) However, Article 23(6) of Directive 2000/29/EC provides for the possibility to implement further action, if this is necessary to combat PWN.
(4) In April 2006, Portugal presented to the Standing Committee on Plant Health (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) an overview of the results of the survey and the control campaign conducted between 1 November 2005 and 1 April 2006 in the demarcated area for PWN in Portugal. The results showed that, despite the measures taken in the previous years, the area where PWN is present has enlarged considerably.
(5) The Commission and the Committee concluded that the mid-term eradication plan has to be revised by Portugal and that urgent action was required, including an intensified survey campaign and a redefinition of the demarcated area.
(6) In May 2006, Portugal presented to the Committee an action plan with measures to be envisaged for combating a further spread of PWN. (6) These measures included an updated delimitation of the demarcated area, eradication of all declining trees in that area, continued monitoring and the creation of a barrier free from all host trees of the pinewood nematode vector, that is a ‘clear cut belt’, which should stop the spread of PWN to other Member States, safeguarding them from devastating losses for pine forests and possible trade restrictions from third countries. It defines in particular the parts of the territory where the clear cut belt will be situated. A final version of this action plan was approved by the Committee in July 2006.
(7) In July 2006, Portugal introduced a programme for further actions for PWN and a budget estimation referring to this programme in order to receive a financial contribution from the Community. The different parts of the Portuguese territory where the actions have to take place, which determine the geographical area benefiting from a financial contribution from the Community, are defined in the above mentioned action plan.
(8) The programme provided for by Portugal has enabled the Commission to analyse the situation accurately and comprehensively and to conclude that the conditions for the granting of a Community financial contribution, as laid down in Article 23(6) of the Directive have been met. That Community financial contribution should be granted for expenditure under that programme that improves the phytosanitary protection of the rest of the Community against a further spread of PWN from the demarcated area. That contribution should, consequently, be granted for all actions directly linked to the creation of a clear cut belt as an area free from PWN vector hosts.
(9) The Community financial contribution may, in general, cover no more than 50 % of eligible expenditure. However, where such further action, is essentially designed to protect Community territories other than that of the Member State concerned, that contribution may be larger. Given the great relevance of PWN for coniferous plants and wood, the rapidity with which the disease spreads, the proximity of another Member State to the infested zone and the possible impact on European forestry and international wood trade, that condition is fulfilled with respect to the measures relating to the creation of a clear cut belt, as provided for in the Portuguese action plan. Therefore, it is appropriate to allocate a Community financial contribution of 75 %.
(10) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (7), plant-health measures are to be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For the purpose of financial control of these measures Articles 9, 36 and 37 of Regulation 1290/2005 shall apply.
(11) The actions linked to the creation of a clear-cut belt as an area free from PWN vector hosts should be in compliance with the applicable Community environmental legislation.
(12) The measures provided in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'header': '14.12.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 354/42', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 December 2006\non a Community financial contribution for 2006 and 2007 to cover expenditure incurred by Portugal for the purpose of combatingBursaphelenchus xylophilus(Steiner et Buhrer) Nickleet al.(pinewood nematode)\n(notified under document number C(2006) 6433)\n(Only the Portuguese text is authentic)\n(2006/923/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Directive 2000/29/EC, a financial contribution from the Community may be granted to Member States to cover expenditure relating directly to the necessary measures which have been taken or are planned to be taken for the purpose of combating harmful organisms introduced from third countries or from other areas in the Community, in order to eradicate or, if that is not possible, to contain them.\n\n((2)) By Commission Decisions 2001/811/EC(2), 2002/889/EC(3), 2003/787/EC(4)and 2004/772/EC(5), a financial contribution from the Community was already granted to Portugal for measures aiming at the control ofBursaphelenchus xylophilus(Steiner et Buhrer) Nickleet al.(pinewood nematode), hereinafter ‘PWN’, in the years 1999-2003, that is for the maximum duration possible.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49, 57, 66 and 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas, pursuant to the Treaty, all discriminatory treatment based on nationality with regard to establishment and to the provision of services is prohibited from the end of the transitional period ; whereas the principle of such national treatment applies in particular to the right to join professional organizations where the professional activities of the person concerned necessarily involve the exercise of this right;
Whereas not all Member States impose conditions for the taking up and pursuit of activities of insurance agent and broker ; whereas in some cases there is freedom to take up and pursue such activities but in other cases there are strict provisions making access to the profession conditional upon possession of formal evidence of qualifications;
Whereas, in view of the differences between Member States as regards the scope of activities of insurance agent and broker, it is desirable to define as clearly as possible the activities to which this Directive is to apply;
Whereas, moreover, Article 57 of the Treaty provides that, in order to make it easier for persons to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons, Directives are to be issued for the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications and for the coordination of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States;
Whereas, in the absence of mutual recognition of diplomas or of immediate coordination, it nevertheless appears desirable to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services for the activities in question, in particular by the adoption of transitional measures of the kind envisaged in the General Programmes (3) in order to avoid undue constraint on the nationals of Member States in which the taking up of such activities is not subject to any conditions;
Whereas, in order to prevent such difficulties arising, the object of the transitional measures should be to allow, as sufficient qualification for taking up the activities in question in host Member States which have rules governing the taking up of such activities, the fact that the activity has been pursued in the Member State whence the foreign national comes for a reasonable and sufficiently recent period of time, in cases where previous training is not required, to ensure that the person concerned possesses professional knowledge equivalent to that required of the host Member State's own nationals;
Whereas, in view of the situation in the Netherlands, where insurance brokers are, depending on their professional knowledge, divided up into several categories, an equivalent system should be provided for in respect of nationals of other Member States who wish to take up an activity in one or other of the categories concerned ; whereas the most appropriate and objective criterion for this purpose is the number of employees whom the person concerned has or has had working under him;
Whereas, where the activity of agent includes the exercise of a permanent authority from one or more insurance undertakings empowering the beneficiary, in respect of certain or all transactions falling within the normal scope of the business of the undertaking  (1)OJ No C 78, 2.8.1971, p. 13.

or undertakings concerned, to enter in the name of such undertaking or undertakings into commitments binding upon it or them, the person concerned must be able to take up the activity of broker in the host Member State;
Whereas the purpose of this Directive will disappear once the coordination of conditions for the taking up and pursuit of the activities in question and the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications have been achieved;
Whereas, in so far as in Member States the taking up or pursuit of the activities referred to in this Directive is also dependent in the case of paid employees on the possession of professional knowledge and ability, this Directive should also apply to this category of persons in order to remove an obstacle to the free movement of workers and thereby to supplement the measures adopted in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 312/76 (2);

(2) Given the present situation on the market in pigmeat, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162 to 164, 167, 169 and 170 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 2500 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2298/2001(5), should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, authorisations of plant protection products for use on specific crops are the responsibility of the Member States. Such authorisations are required to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.
(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.
(3) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.
(4) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.
(5) Information on new or changed uses of certain pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC has been notified to the Commission. This concerns bifenthrin, for which MRLs were set by Commission Directive 2002/79/EC (3) and famoxadone for which MRLs were set by Commission Directive 2003/60/EC (4).
(6) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (5). It has been calculated that the MRLs concerned will ensure that the acceptable daily intakes are not exceeded.
(7) In the case of famoxadone, for which an acute reference (ARfD) dose exists, the acute exposure of consumers via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers from food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account. The intake assessment of famoxadone shows, that by setting the MRLs concerned, the ARfD will not be exceeded. In the case of bifenthrin, an assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short-term assessment is not needed.
(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of those pesticides.
(9) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for famoxadone in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(2), and in particular Articles 12(6) and 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1467/1999(4), lays down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the aid scheme to compensate for loss of income from marketing in the banana sector.
(2) Pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, the compensatory aid is calculated on the basis of the difference between the flat-rate reference income and the average production income from bananas produced and marketed in the Community during the year in question. Supplementary aid is granted in one or more producer regions where the average income from production is significantly lower than the average for the Community.
(3) Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 fixes the flat-rate reference income at EUR 64,03 per 100 kilograms net weight of green bananas ex-packing shed for the aid to be calculated in respect of 1999.
(4) In 1999, the average production income, calculated on the basis of the average of the prices for bananas marketed outside the producer regions at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading (goods not unloaded) on the one hand and the selling prices on local markets for bananas marketed in their producer region on the other, less the flat-rate amounts laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, was less than the flat-rate reference income fixed for 1999. The compensatory aid to be granted in respect of 1999 should be fixed accordingly.
(5) The aid for 1999 is relatively high and it is difficult to predict at present the evolution of prices over the whole of the 2000 marketing year. As a result, from the economic viewpoint the unit amount of advances should not be set at relatively high level which could prove exorbitant when the aid for the year is determined. The level of advances should be fixed at 60 % of the amount of aid granted for 1999.
(6) The annual average production income from the marketing of bananas produced in Portugal, Martinique and Guadeloupe has proved to be significantly lower than the Community average during 1999. As a result, supplementary aid should be granted in the producer regions in Portugal, Martinique and Guadeloupe pursuant to Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, in accordance with the practice followed in recent years. As regards the regions in Portugal, and Madeira in particular, the data for 1999 reveal extremely difficult production and marketing conditions, requiring supplementary aid to be fixed at a level covering 75 % of the difference between the average income in the Community and the average recorded on selling products in that region. The specific marketing difficulties in Guadeloupe, which has been hit by cyclones several times in recent years and has had difficulties rebuilding its marketing capacities, justify the granting of supplementary aid covering the same percentage of the difference between the Community average and regional income.
(7) Given the lack of all the data necessary, it has not hitherto been possible to determine the compensatory aid for 1999. Provision should be made for the balance of the aid to be paid within two months of the publication of this Regulation. In view of the latter points, provision should be made for this Regulation to enter into force on the day following its publication.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1157/2000 of 30 May 2000 fixing the compensatory aid for bananas produced and marketed in the Community in 1999, the time limit for payment of the balance of the aid and the unit value of the advances for 2000', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n\n((8)) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.\n\n((9)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed either in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 respectively, are fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 30 July 2004.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 30 July 2004 to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(EUR/100\xa0kg)\nCN code\nDescription of products\n(\n1\n)\nRate of refund per 100\xa0kg of basic product\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\n1001\xa010\xa000\nDurum wheat:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1001\xa090\xa099\nCommon wheat and meslin:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n2\n)\n—\n—\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– – in other cases\n—\n—\n1002\xa000\xa000\nRye\n—\n—\n1003\xa000\xa090\nBarley\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1004\xa000\xa000\nOats\n—\n—\n1005\xa090\xa000\nMaize (corn) used in the form of:\n– starch:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n2\n)\n4,269\n4,269\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n2,046\n2,046\n– – in other cases\n4,611\n4,611\n– glucose, glucose syrup, maltodextrine, maltodextrine syrup of CN codes 1702\xa030\xa051 , 1702\xa030\xa059 , 1702\xa030\xa091 , 1702\xa030\xa099 , 1702\xa040\xa090 , 1702\xa090\xa050 , 1702\xa090\xa075 , 1702\xa090\xa079 , 2106\xa090\xa055\n(\n4\n)\n:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n2\n)\n3,116\n3,116\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n1,535\n1,535\n– – in other cases\n3,458\n3,458\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n2,046\n2,046\n– other (including unprocessed)\n4,611\n4,611\nPotato starch of CN code 1108\xa013\xa000  similar to a product obtained from processed maize:\n– where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n2\n)\n4,010\n4,010\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n2,046\n2,046\n– in other cases\n4,611\n4,611\nex\xa01006\xa030\nWholly milled rice:\n– round grain\n—\n—\n– medium grain\n—\n—\n– long grain\n—\n—\n1006\xa040\xa000\nBroken rice\n—\n—\n1007\xa000\xa090\nGrain sorghum, other than hybrid for sowing\n—\n—\n(\n1\n)\nAs far as agricultural products obtained from the processing of a basic product or/and assimilated products are concerned, the coefficients shown in Annex E to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 shall be applied (\nOJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1\n).\n(\n2\n)\nThe goods concerned fall in under CN code 3505\xa010\xa050.\n(\n3\n)\nGoods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1784/2003 or referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93.\n(\n4\n)\nFor syrups of CN codes NC 1702\xa030\xa099, 1702\xa040\xa090 and 1702\xa060\xa090, obtained from mixing glucose and fructose syrup, the export refund may be granted only for the glucose syrup.'}]}"

(1) Article 20a of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides for the granting of a production refund for olive oil used in the preserving industry. Under paragraph 6 of that Article, and without prejudice to paragraph 3 thereof, the Commission shall fix this refund every two months.
(2) By virtue of Article 20a(2) of the abovementioned Regulation, the production refund must be fixed on the basis of the gap between prices on the world market and on the Community market, taking account of the import charge applicable to olive oil falling within CN subheading 1509 90 00 and the factors used for fixing the export refunds for those olive oils during the reference period. It is appropriate to take as a reference period the two-month period preceding the beginning of the term of validity of the production refund.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, submitted following consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Whereas:
(1) The scope and intensity of the international financial crisis affects the potential demand for Community medium-term financial assistance in the Member States outside the euro area and calls for a significant raising of the ceiling for the outstanding amount of loans to be granted to Member States laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 (3) from EUR 25 billion to EUR 50 billion.
(2) In the light of recent experience gained in the functioning of medium-term financial assistance, the tasks and responsibilities of the Commission and of the Member States concerned with the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 should be clarified. In addition, the conditions for granting the financial assistance should be set out in detail in a Memorandum of Understanding to be concluded between the Commission and the Member State concerned.
(3) The rules guiding some aspects of the financial management of Community financial assistance should be clarified. For operational reasons, the Member State concerned should be asked to place the financial assistance received in a special account with its National Central Bank and to transfer the amounts due to an account with the European Central Bank a few days prior to their due dates.
(4) Sound management of the Community financial assistance received is of paramount importance. Therefore, without prejudice to Article 27 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for the European Court of Auditors and the European Anti-Fraud Office, when they deem necessary, to carry out controls in the Member State receiving Community medium-term financial assistance, as already provided for in the existing loan agreements.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 95/408/EC of 22 of June 1995(1) on the conditions for drawing up, for an interim period, provisional lists of third country establishments from which Member States are authorised to import certain products of animal origin, fishery products or live bivalve molluscs, as amended by Decision 2001/4/EC(2), and in particular Article 2 (2) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 97/296/EC(3), as last amended by Decision 2002/473/EC(4), lists the countries and territories from which importation of fishery products for human consumption is authorised. Part I of the Annex lists the names of the countries and territories covered by a specific Decision under Directive 91/493/EEC and part II names those qualifying under Article 2(2) of Decision 95/408/EC.
(2) Commission Decisions C(2002) 4091(5), C(2002) 4090(6), C(2002) 4088(7), C(2002) 4096(8), C(2002) 4092(9), C(2002) 4097(10), C(2002) 4094(11), C(2002) 4098(12) and C(2002) 4099(13) set specific import conditions for fishery and aquaculture products originating in Greenland, New Caledonia, Costa Rica, Papua New Guinea, Suriname, Switzerland, Mozambique, Honduras and Kazakhstan. The mentioned countries should therefore be added to part I of the Annex.
(3) The the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has provided information that it satisfies equivalent conditions to those laid down in Community legislation and is able to guarantee that the fishery products it will export to the Community meet the health requirements of Directive 91/493/EEC; it is therefore necessary to include this country in Part II of the list. Nevertheless, following the information and the guarantees received from the competent authorities of this country it is necessary to restrain the imports of fishery products to wild fish intended for direct human consumption. Furthermore, the information provided by the Yugoslav authority does not pertain to Kosovo, as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999, which is subject to international civil administration by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). It is therefore not possible at this stage to cover Kosovo under Part II of the list.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 127 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 of 23 November 2005 concerning the common organisation of the market in hops (2) is to be repealed from 1 July 2008 under Article 201(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (Single CMO Regulation).
(2) Certain provisions relating to the producer groups laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1952/2005 have not been incorporated in the Single CMO Regulation. In order to enable the hops sector to continue to function properly, it is necessary to lay down those provisions in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1299/2007 of 6 November 2007 on the recognition of producer groups for hops (3).
(3) The Single CMO Regulation has laid down in Article 122 the general conditions for the recognition of producer organisations by the Member States. Those conditions should be specified for the hops sector. For sake of consistency, the term ‘producer groups’ should continue to be used in that sector.
(4) To avoid any discrimination between producers and to ensure the unity and effectiveness of any action undertaken, conditions should be laid down, for the whole of the Community, with which producer groups must comply in order to be recognised by the Member States. To achieve an effective centralisation of supply, it is necessary in particular that the groups should be of an economically viable size and that the entire output of producers should be marketed either directly by the group or by the producers, according to common rules.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1299/2007 should be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Council Decision 91/341/EEC of 20 June 1991, on the adoption of a community programme of action on the subject of vocational training of customs officials (Matthaeus programme) (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas under the terms of Article 4c of Decision 91/341/EEC, the Commission is called on to establish common vocational training programmes for customs officials;
Whereas these common programmes are essential in order to achieve the objectives pursued by the Matthaeus programme and, in particular, that concerned with the uniform application of Community law at the external frontiers of the Community;
Whereas those common programmes are rendered necessary by the diversity of teaching currently given in the customs schools of the Members States;
Whereas a common vocational programme for officials in initial training has already been adopted by Commission Decision 92/39/EEC (2);
Whereas specific common further training and specialized programmes, carried out in the customs schools in conjunction with the initial common programme, will reinforce the establishment of an identical training in customs matters throughout the  Community;
Whereas such specific common programmes will concern officials already having had some vocational experience;
Whereas three specific common programmes of development and specialization regarding inward processing, temporary admission and transit have already been adopted by Commission Decision 93/15/EEC (3);
Whereas four specific common programmes relating to preferential systems, the control of containers, processing under customs control and warehouse regimes are necessary;
Whereas this necessity arises from, on the one hand, the economic importance of preferential regimes, processing under customs control and customs warehousing and, on the other hand, the priority for the fight against fraud of the control of containers;
Whereas, the teaching of these programmes will assist the uniform application in the Community of the customs rules and assure the proper functioning of the single market;
Whereas the officials to whom these specific common programmes will be given must, through their work experience, be able to derive full benefit from the programmes and thereby ensure better application of the relevant community customs law and a more  effective fight against fraud in the future;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 of 24 September 2004 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Bulgaria and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Bulgaria (6) with the effect from 1 October 2004, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Bulgaria are not eligible for the export refunds.

Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),
Whereas Seventh Directive 94/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on summer-time arrangements (4) introduced a common date and time throughout the Community for the beginning of summertime in 1995, 1996 and 1997; whereas the Seventh Directive retained two different dates for the end of summertime in 1995, one for Member States other than Ireland and the United Kingdom and one for Ireland and the United Kingdom, but nonetheless introduced a common date and time for the end of summertime in 1996 and 1997;
Whereas, given that the Member States apply summer-time arrangements, it is important for the functioning of the internal market that a common date and time for the beginning and end of the summer-time period be fixed throughout the Community;

Whereas the date considered most appropriate by Member States for the end of the summer-time period is the end of October; whereas this date should therefore be maintained;

Whereas, for geographical reasons, common summer-time arrangements should not apply to the overseas territories of the Member States;
Whereas, for reasons of timetabling, particularly in the transport and communications sectors, the timing of summer-time arrangements should be set for a sufficiently long period; whereas provisions should accordingly be adopted for 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001,","{'title': 'Eighth Directive 97/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 1997 on summer-time arrangements', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive, 'summer-time period` shall mean the period of the year during which clocks are put forward by 60 minutes compared with the rest of the year.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nIn each Member State the summer-time period for 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 shall begin at 1 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday in March, i.e.:\n\n- in 1998: on 29 March,\n\n- in 1999: on 28 March,\n\n- in 2000: on 26 March,\n\n- in 2001: on 25 March.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nIn each Member State the summer-time period for 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 shall end at 1 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time on the last Sunday in October, i.e.:\n\n- in 1998: on 25 October,\n\n- in 1999: on 31 October,\n\n- in 2000: on 29 October,\n\n- in 2001: on 28 October.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe arrangements to apply from 2002 onwards shall be adopted by 1 January 2001 on a proposal from the Commission to be submitted before 1 January 2000.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\nThis Directive shall not apply to the overseas territories of the Member States.'}, {'id': '6', 'title': 'Article 6', 'text': 'Article 6\n\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 31 December 1997 at the latest.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 719/91 of 21 March 1991 on the use in the Community of TIR carnets and ATA carnets as transit documents (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3599/82 of 21 December 1982 on temporary importation arrangements (2), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1620/85 (3), and in particular Article 33 thereof,
Whereas it is necessary to lay down the conditions for the operation of the system for guaranteeing payment of duties and taxes envisaged in the Customs Convention on the ATA Carnet for the Temporary Admission of Goods, hereinafter referred to as the  'ATA Convention';
Whereas with the removal of the internal frontiers of the Community and the abolition of formalities attending the crossing of those frontiers specific procedures have been laid down to determine which Member State has jurisdiction, in the event of an  offence or irregularity, for the recovery of duties and other charges; whereas those procedures are laid down in Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 719/91 and Article 13 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2365/91 of 31 July 1991 laying down the conditions  for use of the ATA carnet for the temporary importation of goods into the customs territory of the Community or their temporary exportation from that territory (4);
Whereas, however, the removal of internal frontiers leaves in existence the 12 guaranteeing associations in the Community, with each one still linked with the customs administration of the country in which it has its headquarters; whereas, consequently,  the measures aimed at determining the place where an offence or irregularity occurred lead to the risk of multiple guarantee claims being made in respect of a consignment of goods covered by a single carnet; whereas it is necessary, accordingly, to make  uniform arrangements for the provision of information and the transfer of proceedings between Member States;
Whereas to that end it is expedient to make provision for the establishment in each Member State of a coordinating office for proceedings on claims relating to ATA carnets;
Whereas the uniform and coordinated operation of all the time limits laid down in the ATA Convention requires that action for recovery should be commenced no sooner than three months after the date of expiry of an ATA carnet;
Whereas the risk of multiple claims in respect of the same goods covered by the same carnet can be diminished by the coordinating office which makes the claim sending an information memo to the coordinating office of the Member State of temporary  admission, or whenever such information is necessary; whereas it is necessary to provide a model of this information memo;
Whereas it is also necessary, for the purposes of harmonizing procedures, to make provision for the introduction of a single taxation form for collecting the amount of duties and taxes due;
Whereas a procedure for transferring proceedings between Member States must be instituted for cases where the offence or irregularity is eventually found to have been committed in a Member State other than the one in which the recovery proceedings were  originally initiated; whereas it is necessary to lay down the detailed rules applying according to the point in time at which the proceedings are transferred;

VALIDATED METHOD\n\nDetermination of the alcoholic strength of wines using a hydrostatic balance\n\n1. METHOD OF MEASUREMENT\n\n1.1. Introduction\n\nAlcoholic strength by volume must be measured before marketing, principally to comply with labelling rules.\n\nAlcoholic strength by volume is equal to the number of litres of ethanol contained in 100 litres of wine measured at 20 °C. Referred to as \' % vol.\'.\n\n1.2. Object and field of application\n\nThe method of measurement described is densimetry using a hydrostatic balance.\n\nFor the purposes of the regulatory provisions in force, the trial temperature is set at 20 °C.\n\n1.3. Principle and definitions\n\nThe principle of this method is based on distilling wine volume by volume. The distilling method is described in this Chapter. Distillation eliminates non-volatile substances. Homologues of ethanol, together with the ethanol and ethanol homologues in ethyl esters, are included in the alcoholic strength since they occur in the distillate.\n\nThe density of the distillate obtained is then measured. The density of a liquid at a given temperature is equal to the quotient of the mass over its volume: ρ2 = m/V; for wine, it is expressed in g/ml.\n\nThe alcoholic strength of wines can be measured by densimetry using a hydrostatic balance based on Archimedes\' principle, according to which a body immersed in a liquid receives a vertical upward thrust from the liquid equal to the weight of liquid displaced.\n\n1.4. Reagents\n\nDuring the analysis, unless otherwise is stated, use only reagents of recognised analytical grade and water of at least grade 3 as defined in ISO 3696:1987.\n\n1.4.1. Float-cleaning solution (sodium hydroxide, 30 % w/v)\n\nTo prepare 100 ml, weigh 30 g sodium hydroxide and make up to volume using 96 % volume ethanol.\n\n1.5. Apparatus and equipment\n\nUsual laboratory apparatus and in particular the following:\n\n1.5.1. Single-pan hydrostatic balance with a sensitivity of 1 mg.\n\n1.5.2. Float with a volume of at least 20 ml, specially adapted to the balance, suspended with a thread of diameter not exceeding 0,1 mm.\n\n1.5.3. Measuring cylinder bearing a level mark. The float must be capable of being contained completely within the volume of the cylinder located below the mark; the surface of the liquid may be penetrated only by the supporting thread. The measuring cylinder must have an internal diameter at least 6 mm larger than that of the float.\n\n1.5.4. Thermometer (or temperature-measuring probe) graduated in degrees and tenths of a degree from 10 °C to 40 °C, calibrated to 0,05 °C.\n\n1.5.5. Weights, calibrated by a recognised certifying body.\n\n1.6. Procedure\n\nThe float and measuring cylinder must be cleaned between each measurement with distilled water, dried with soft laboratory paper which does not shed fibres and rinsed with the solution whose density is to be determined. Measurements must be made as soon as the apparatus has reached stability so as to restrict alcohol loss by evaporation.\n\n1.6.1. Calibration of the balance\n\nAlthough balances usually have an internal calibration system, the hydrostatic balance must be capable of calibration with weights checked by an official certifying body.\n\n1.6.2. Calibration of the float\n\n1.6.2.1. Fill the measuring cylinder to the mark with double-distilled water (or water of equivalent purity, e.g. microfiltered water with a conductivity of 18,2 MΩ/cm) at a temperature between 15 °C and 25 °C but preferably at 20 °C.\n\n1.6.2.2. Immerse the float and the thermometer, stir, read off the density of the liquid from the apparatus and, if necessary, correct the reading so that it is equal to that of the water at measurement temperature.\n\n1.6.3. Control using a water-alcohol solution\n\n1.6.3.1. Fill the measuring cylinder to the mark with a water-alcohol mixture of known strength at a temperature between 15 °C and 25 °C but preferably at 20 °C.\n\n1.6.3.2. Immerse the float and the thermometer, stir, read off the density of the liquid (or the alcoholic strength if this is possible) from the apparatus. The alcoholic strength thus established should be equal to the previously determined alcoholic strength.\n\nNote:\n\nThis solution of known alcoholic strength can also be used to calibrate the float instead of double-distilled water.\n\n1.6.4. Measurement of the density of a distillate (or of its alcoholic strength if the apparatus allows)\n\n1.6.4.1. Pour the test sample into the measuring cylinder up to the graduation mark.\n\n1.6.4.2. Immerse the float and the thermometer, stir, read off the density of the liquid (or the alcoholic strength if this is possible) from the apparatus. Note the temperature if the density is measured at t °C ρt.\n\n1.6.4.3. Correct ρt using the table of densities ρt for water-alcohol mixtures (Table II of Annex II to this Chapter).\n\n1.6.5. Cleaning of float and measuring cylinder\n\n1.6.5.1. Immerse the float in the float-cleaning solution in the measuring cylinder.\n\n1.6.5.2. Allow to soak for one hour spinning the float periodically.\n\n1.6.5.3. Rinse with copious amounts of tap water followed by distilled water.\n\n1.6.5.4. Dry with soft laboratory paper which does not shed fibres.\n\nCarry out this procedure when the float is first used and then regularly as required.\n\n1.6.6. Result\n\nUsing the density ρ20, calculate the real alcoholic strength using the table giving the value of the alcoholic strength by volume ( % vol.) at 20 °C as a function of the density at 20 °C of water-alcohol mixtures, i.e. the international table adopted by the International Legal Metrology Organisation in its Recommendation No 22.\n\n2. COMPARISON OF MEASUREMENTS MADE USING A HYDROSTATIC BALANCE WITH PROCEDURES OBTAINED USING AN ELECTRONIC DENSIMETER\n\nUsing samples with an alcoholic strength between 4 % and 18 % vol., repeatability and reproducibility were measured following an inter-laboratory ring test. The alcoholic strength of different samples as measured using the hydrostatic balance and the electronic densimeter and the repeatability and reproducibility values derived from an extensive multiannual inter-comparison exercise were compared.\n\n2.1. Samples\n\nWines of different density and alcoholic strength prepared each month on industrial scale, taken from a properly stored stock of bottles and delivered as anonymous products to the laboratories.\n\n2.2. Laboratories\n\nLaboratories participating in the monthly ring test organised by the Unione Italiana Vini (Verona, Italy) according to ISO 5725 (UNI 9225) rules and the International Protocol of Proficiency Testing for chemical analysis laboratories established by AOAC, ISO and IUPAC and ISO 43 and ILAC G13 guidelines. An annual report is to be supplied by this company to all participants.\n\n2.3. Equipment\n\n2.3.1. Electronic hydrostatic balance (accurate to 5 decimal places), if possible with a data processing device:\n\n2.3.2. Electronic densimeter, if possible with autosampler.\n\n2.4. Analysis\n\nAccording to the rules for the validation of methods, each sample was analysed twice consecutively to determine the alcoholic strength.\n\n2.5. Result\n\nTable 1 shows the results of the measurements obtained by the laboratories using the hydrostatic balance.\n\nTable 2 shows the results obtained by the laboratories using an electronic densimeter.\n\n2.6. Evaluations of the results\n\n2.6.1. The trial results were examined for evidence of individual systematic error (p &lt;  0,025) using Cochran\'s and Grubb\'s tests successively, by procedures described in the internationally agreed Protocol for the Design, Conduct and Interpretation of Method-Performance Studies.\n\n2.6.2. Repeatability (r) and reproducibility (R)\n\nCalculations for repeatability (r) and reproducibility (R) as defined by that protocol were carried out on those results remaining after the removal of outliers. When assessing a new method there is often no validated reference or statutory method with which to compare precision criteria, hence it is useful to compare the precision data obtained from a collaborative trial with \'predicted\' levels of precision. These \'predicted\' levels are calculated from the Horwitz equation. Comparison of the trial results and the predicted levels give an indication as to whether the method is sufficiently precise for the level of analyte being measured. The Horwitz predicted value is calculated from the Horwitz equation.\n\nRSDR = 2(1-0,5 logC)\n\nwhere C = measured concentration of analyte expressed as a decimal (e.g. 1 g/100 g = 0,01).\n\nThe Horrat value gives a comparison of the actual precision measured with the precision predicted by the Horwitz equation for a method measuring at that particular level of analyte. It is calculated as follows:\n\nHoR = RSDR(measured)/RSDR(Horwitz )\n\n2.6.3. Interlaboratory precision\n\nA Horrat value of 1 usually indicates satisfactory inter-laboratory precision, whereas a value of 2 usually indicates unsatisfactory precision, i.e. one that is too variable for most analytical purposes or where the variation obtained is greater than that expected for the type of method employed. Hor is also calculated, and used to assess intra-laboratory precision, using the following approximation:\n\nRSDr(Horwitz) = 0,66 RSDR(Horwitz) (this assumes the approximation r = 0,66 R).\n\nTable 3 shows the differences between the measurements obtained by laboratories using electronic densimetry and those using a hydrostatic balance. Excluding sample 2000/3, which had very low alcohol strength and for which both techniques show poor reproducibility, a very good agreement is generally observed for all other samples.\n\n2.6.4. Fidelity parameters\n\nTable 4 shows the average overall fidelity parameters computed from all monthly trials carried out from January 1999 until May 2001.\n\nIn particular:\n\nRepeatability (r) = 0,074 ( % vol.) for the hydrostatic balance and 0,061 ( % vol.) for electronic densimetry;\n\nReproducibility (R) = 0,229 ( % vol.) for the hydrostatic balance and 0,174 ( % vol.) for electronic densimetry.\n\n2.7. Conclusion\n\nThe results of determining the alcoholic strength of a wide range of wines show the comparability of measurements carried out with the hydrostatic balance and the electronic density-meter using a frequency oscillator and demonstrate that the values of the validation parameters are similar for both methods.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n>TABLE>\n\n>TABLE>\n\n>TABLE>""'}]}"

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Article 10(3) and Article 30(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) That list may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2).
(3) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) An application for authorisation of the use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) as preservative in alcohol-free counterparts of wine was submitted and has been made available to the Member States.
(5) These alcohol-free counterparts of wine are produced by removing the alcohol from the wine after fermentation. In order to avoid secondary fermentation in the bottle, sorbic acid — sorbates (E 200-203) are used and subsequent pasteurisation is required. However, pasteurisation alters and degrades the natural fruit aromas and flavours of the product. Addition of benzoates has a synergistic effect with sorbates, allowing a better preservation and reducing the need to pasteurise.
(6) Alcohol-free counterparts of wine are presented and marketed as alternative to wine to adults who choose not to drink alcoholic beverages. Consumption of these counterparts does not substitute consumption of soft drinks. The additional exposure to benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) based on this new use will therefore remain limited and will not lead to exceedence of the acceptable daily intake established by the Scientific Committee for Food (3). It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine.
(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.
(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives (4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) in alcohol-free counterparts of wine before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of that food additive.

In order to avoid secondary fermentation in the bottle, sorbic acid — sorbates (E 200-203) are used and subsequent pasteurisation is required. However, pasteurisation alters and degrades the natural fruit aromas and flavours of the product. Addition of benzoates has a synergistic effect with sorbates, allowing a better preservation and reducing the need to pasteurise.\n\n((6)) Alcohol-free counterparts of wine are presented and marketed as alternative to wine to adults who choose not to drink alcoholic beverages. Consumption of these counterparts does not substitute consumption of soft drinks. The additional exposure to benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) based on this new use will therefore remain limited and will not lead to exceedence of the acceptable daily intake established by the Scientific Committee for Food(3). It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine.\n\n((7)) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) for the preservation of alcohol-free counterparts of wine constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.\n\n((8)) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of benzoic acid — benzoates (E 210-213) in alcohol-free counterparts of wine before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to this use of that food additive.\n\n((9)) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nIn Part E of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 the following entry is inserted in the food category 14.2.2 ‘Wine and other products defined by Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, and alcohol-free counterparts’ after the entry for E 200-203:\n‘E 210-213\nBenzoic acid — benzoates\n200\n(1) (2)\nonly alcohol-free\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 19 July 2012’'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 (2), import licences shall only be valid for the product code shown on it. Imports under quotas may experience difficulties where allocation coefficients are reducing the quantities for each product code for which licence applications have been lodged. To facilitate trade and to optimise the use of the import quotas it is appropriate that import licences are also valid for other product codes falling under the same quota number, provided they are submitted to an equal import duty. Since the current provisions may result in quantities of import licences issued in January 2007 not being used, it is appropriate to provide for a retroactive application of the new provisions.
(2) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (3), approved by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom, of the Council and of the Commission (4) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Agreement with Switzerland’), includes the opening of quotas and reductions in customs duties on certain milk products originating in Switzerland. In its Annex 3, relating to concessions regarding cheeses, point 1 provides for the full liberalisation of the bilateral trade in cheeses as from 1 June 2007, after a five-year transition process.
(3) The objective of the Agreement with Switzerland is to strengthen the free-trade relations between the Parties by gradually eliminating the barriers affecting the bulk of their trade. Bilateral trade in cheese will no longer be submitted to any quotas as from 1 June 2007. Therefore, and since the trade in cheeses between the Community and Switzerland relates to important quantities and a high commercial value, it is appropriate to reduce substantially the security on the import licences for cheese originating in Switzerland.
(4) Following the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1719/2005 of 27 October 2005 amending Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (5), CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 have been deleted. Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 has therefore become redundant and should be also deleted.
(5) Annex II to the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products undertaken on the basis of Article 19 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area (6), approved by Council Decision 2007/138/EC (7), provides for the opening of an annual tariff quota for certain dairy products.

(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the joint meeting of the Management Committees for cereals, pigmeat, poultrymeat and eggs, milk and milk products, beef and veal, sheepmeat and goatmeat, oils and fats, sugar, processed fruit and vegetables, hops, seeds and dried fodder,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 of 28 December 2001 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe quantities of the forecast supply balance for products which benefit from exemption from duties on imports of products from third countries or which benefit from Community aid, and the amounts of aid granted for the supply of Community products, shall be as set out, for each product, in:\n\n(a) Annex I for the French overseas departments;\n\n(b) Annex II for Madeira and the Azores;\n\n(c) Annex III for the Canary Islands.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nRegulations (EEC) Nos 1725/92(5), 1726/92(6), 1727/92(7), 1912/92(8), 1913/92(9), 1961/92(10), 1962/92(11), 1983/92(12), 2026/92(13), 2027/92(14), 2168/92(15), 2173/92(16), 2177/92(17), 2219/92(18), 2224/92(19), 2225/92(20), 2254/92(21), 2255/92(22), 2257/92(23), 2312/92(24), 2547/92(25), 2826/92(26), 2989/92(27), 2999/92(28), 1148/93(29) and (EC) Nos 2940/94(30), 2993/94(31), 3010/94(32), 1487/95(33), 1797/95(34), 1261/96(35), 1771/96(36), 1772/96(37) and 28/97(38) are hereby repealed.\n\nIn Regulation (EC) No 1524/98, Chapter I and Annex I are hereby deleted.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply from 1 January 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 December 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 11.\n\n(2) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 26.\n\n(3) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 45.\n\n(4) See page 1 of this Official Journal.\n\n(5) OJ L 179, 1.7.1992, p. 95.\n\n(6) OJ L 179, 1.7.1992, p. 99.\n\n(7) OJ L 179, 1.7.1992, p. 101.\n\n(8) OJ L 192, 11.7.1992, p. 31.\n\n(9) OJ L 192, 11.7.1992, p. 35.\n\n(10) OJ L 197, 16.7.1992, p. 44.\n\n(11) OJ L 197, 16.7.1992, p. 45.\n\n(12) OJ L 198, 17.7.1992, p. 37.\n\n(13) OJ L 207, 23.7.1992, p. 18.\n\n(14) OJ L 207, 23.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(15) OJ L 217, 31.7.1992, p. 44.\n\n(16) OJ L 217, 31.7.1992, p. 56.\n\n(17) OJ L 217, 31.7.1992, p. 71.\n\n(18) OJ L 218, 1.8.1992, p. 75.\n\n(19) OJ L 218, 1.8.1992, p. 89.\n\n(20) OJ L 218, 1.8.1992, p. 91.\n\n(21) OJ L 219, 4.8.1992, p. 34.\n\n(22) OJ L 219, 4.8.1992, p. 37.\n\n(23) OJ L 219, 4.8.1992, p. 44.\n\n(24) OJ L 222, 7.8.1992, p. 32.\n\n(25) OJ L 254, 1.9.1992, p. 72.\n\n(26) OJ L 285, 30.9.1992, p. 10.\n\n(27) OJ L 300, 16.10.1992, p. 12.\n\n(28) OJ L 301, 17.10.1992, p. 7.\n\n(29) OJ L 116, 12.5.1993, p. 15.\n\n(30) OJ L 310, 3.12.1994, p. 15.\n\n(31) OJ L 316, 9.12.1994, p. 11.\n\n(32) OJ L 320, 13.12.1994, p. 5.\n\n(33) OJ L 145, 29.6.1995, p. 63.\n\n(34) OJ L 174, 26.7.1995, p. 17.\n\n(35) OJ L 163, 2.7.1996, p. 15.\n\n(36) OJ L 232, 13.9.1996, p. 11.\n\n(37) OJ L 232, 13.9.1996, p. 13.\n\n(38) OJ L 6, 10.1.1997, p. 15.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_I', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX I', 'text': 'ANNEX I\n\nOVERSEAS DEPARTMENTS\n\nPart 1\n\nCereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feed; oilseeds, protein crops, dried fodder\n\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n\n>TABLE>\n\nThe products in this part are 100 % interchangeable for one and the same department.\n\nPart 2\n\nVegetable oil\n\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n\n>TABLE>\n\nThe French authorities may alter the breakdown of the quantity in this part by up to 20 % of the quantity laid down for each department.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in March 1998 Spain received an application from BASF SE for the inclusion of the active substance profoxydim in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 1999/43/EC (2) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(2) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossier was necessary in order to allow it to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods of up to 3 years, for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection products in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.
(3) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The rapporteur Member State submitted the draft assessment report to the Commission on 28 March 2001.
(4) Following submission of the draft assessment report by the rapporteur Member State, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicant and to have the rapporteur Member State examine that information and submit its assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossier is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC, read in conjunction with Commission Decision 2008/564/EC (3).
(5) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substance concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossier to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on a possible inclusion in Annex I to that Directive for profoxydim will have been completed within 24 months.

on financial assistance of the Union with respect to the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria (Kozloduy Programme)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular Article 203 thereof,
Having regard to the Bulgarian request for further funding,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) During the accession negotiations in 2005, Bulgaria agreed to the closure of Units 1 and 2 and Units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant by 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2006, respectively and to the subsequent decommissioning of those units. The European Union expressed its willingness to continue to provide financial assistance up to 2009 as an extension of the pre-accession aid planned under the Phare programme in support of Bulgaria’s decommissioning efforts.
(2) In view of Bulgaria’s commitment to close Units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant, Article 30 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania (hereinafter referred to as the ‘2005 Act of Accession’) established an assistance programme (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Kozloduy Programme’) with a budget of EUR 210 million for the period 2007 to 2009. That programme included assistance to cover the capacity loss as a consequence of the closure of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant.
(3) International decommissioning funds managed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have been in place for a number of years. The Union is the main contributor to those funds.
(4) The Union recognises the effort made and the good progress achieved by Bulgaria in the decommissioning preparation stage of the Kozloduy Programme utilising the Union funds put in place until 2009, and the need for further financial support beyond 2009 in order to continue the progress with the actual dismantling operations in accordance with the 2005 Act of Accession, whilst applying the highest safety standards.
(5) In addition, it is important to use the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant’s own resources, as this contributes to the availability of the necessary expertise, enhances know-how and skills, and at the same time mitigates the social and economic impact of the early closure by continuously employing the staff from the closed nuclear power plant. The continued financial support is therefore important to maintain the required safety, health and environmental standards.
(6) The Union also recognises the need for financial support in order to progress further with mitigating measures in the energy sector given the extent of the capacity loss by the closure of the nuclear units and its impact on the security of supply in the region.
(7) The Union recognises the need to mitigate the effect of increased environmental damage and emissions due to the replacement capacity coming mostly from increased use of lignite plants.
(8) Consequently, provision should be made for a sum of EUR 300 million from the general budget of the Union to fund the decommissioning of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant over the period from 2010 to 2013.
(9) The appropriations of the general budget of the Union for decommissioning should not lead to distortions of competition in relation to power supply companies on the energy market in the Union. These appropriations should also be used to finance energy efficiency and savings measures in line with the acquis and the rules of the functioning of the common European energy market.
(10) The financial assistance should continue to be made available as a Union contribution to the Kozloduy International Decommissioning Support Fund managed by the EBRD.
(11) The tasks of the EBRD include managing the public funds allocated to the programmes for decommissioning those nuclear power units that were subject to accession-linked closure agreements. The EBRD is monitoring the financial management of these programmes so as to optimise the use of public money. In addition, the EBRD carries out the budget tasks entrusted to it by the Commission in line with the requirements of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (2) (the Financial Regulation).
(12) In order to ensure the highest possible efficiency and to minimise possible environmental consequences, the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant should be carried out with recourse to the best available technical expertise, and with due regard to the nature and technological specifications of the units to be shut down.
(13) The decommissioning of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant will be carried out in line with the legislation on the environment, particularly Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment (3).
(14) Principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness in respect of the allocated funds should be ensured through evaluation and performance audits of the previously financed programmes.
(15) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 38 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management (4), should be included in this Regulation for the entire duration of the Kozloduy Programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

of 20 March 2000
concerning aid granted in Italy by RIBS SpA in accordance with the provisions of national law No 700 of 19 December 1983 on the restructuring of the sugar beet sector
(2000/257/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the request put forward by the Government of the Italian Republic on 4 January 2000,
Whereas:
(1) Article 46 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1) authorise: (i) the granting of adjustment aid to producers of sugar beet and, should the case arise, to producers of sugar; (ii) adjustment of that aid where this is necessitated by exceptional requirements connected with plans for restructuring the sugar sector in Italy.
(2) By national law No 700 of 19 December 1983 on the restructuring of the sugar beet sector, Italy set up the public funding body RIBS SpA instructing it to disburse aid to sugar producers in connection with the restructuring plans, basically in the form of participatory credit.
(3) Pursuant to Article 46 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 and subsequent amendments thereto, Italy drew up two general plans to restructure and convert the sugar beet sector during the period 1984/1985 to 1995/1996 which the Commission approved in decisions communicated in letters SG(84) D/6750 of 23 May 1984 and SG(91) D/11490 of 20 June 1991.
(4) Under those general restructuring plans, the Italian Republic implemented a series of specific interventions for certain undertakings which where approved by the Commission and which enabled a start to be made on substantial, effective restructuring in this sector.
(5) Furthermore, some interventions were made without being notified within the meaning of Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
(6) Following the infringement proceedings in respect of RIBS interventions in favour of Celano (Nusam SpA and Sadam Abruzzo SpA) and Castiglion Fiorentino (Sadam Castiglionese SpA) undertakings, the Commission adopted a partly negative decision C(1999) 1363 of 11 May 1999 which was the subject of an appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Communities by the Italian Government.
(7) The Commission initiated infringement proceedings concerning the inteventions in favour of the Ostellato undertaking (CO.PRO.B undertaking), communicated in its letter SG(96) D/1257 of 11 January 1996.
(8) The Italian Government took steps in August 1999 to notify the following interventions: (a) Specific plan for PONTECO, (b) Specific plan for COMAGRI, (c) Renegotiation of loan to COPROB, (d) Renegotiation of loan to SADAM-SECI, (e) Renegotiation of loan to ISI.
(9) The Italian Government also informed the Commission of the specific plan for SPAI SpA, concerning the processing sector, approved on 25 March 1992 in accordance with the general plan to restructure and convert the sugar beet sector during the period 1991 to 1996 which allowed the possibility of financing agro-food activities in areas where it had become necessary to close sugar refineries. The specific plan for SPAI SpA was subsequently revoked on 11 October 1994.
(10) The interventions referred to in recitals 6, 7 and 8 are, in terms of objectives and results, essentially the same as the previous interventions under the general restructuring plans approved by the Commission. These interventions are necessary with a view to the completion of the restructuring process in this sector, and failure to approve them would compromise the reorganisation of the sector and jeopardise the economic equilibrium of several thousand smallholdings operating in the different beet production areas.
(11) The amount of aid granted over the period 1984 to 1992 to the sugar-producing undertakings referred to in recitals 6, 7 and 8 totals EUR 66,9 million, with an annual average impact of approximately 0,5 % of the intervention price for sugar, the effect on competition and intra-Community trade being quite negligible.
(12) The aid granted concerns nearly all industrial groups operating in the sector, which represents an agricultural area of some 265000 hectares and some 65000 holdings in sugar beet production zones.
(13) The SPAI SpA is currently in liquidation and the RIBS has made itself a party to the bankruptcy proceedings.
(14) There are therefore exceptional circumstances which make it possible to classify the aid granted by the Italian Government as compatible with the common market under the conditions provided for by this Decision,","{'title': '2000/257/EC: Council Decision of 20 March 2000 concerning aid granted in Italy by RIBS SpA in accordance with the provisions of national law No 700 of 19 December 1983 on the restructuring of the sugar beet sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2), and in particular Articles 10 and 14 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2786/83 (3) the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia and the USSR and, by Decision 83/502/EEC (4), the Commission accepted an undertaking from on Czech exporter of copper sulphate. This undertaking was subsequently amended and accepted by Decision 84/408/EEC (5).
Subsequently the Commission accepted, by Regulation (EEC) No 2908/84 (6), an undertaking offered inter alia by the Hungarian exporter of copper sulphate and, by Decision 85/104/EEC (7), an undertaking offered by the Polish exporter of that product.
(2) In 1986, the Commission received a request for review of the anti-dumping measures concerning imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR lodged by the European Federation of Chemical Manufacturers Associations representing a major proportion of Community output of copper sulphate. This review request contained evidence of changed circumstances sufficient to justify the need for review and accordingly the Commission announced, by a Notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (8), the opening of a review investigation concerning imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR, falling wihtin subheading ex 28.38 A II of the Common Customs Tariff, and corresponding to NIMEXE code 28.38-27.
(3) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, and the Community producers, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
Most exporters concerned, some importers and all complainant Community producers made their views known in writing and requested and were granted hearings.
No submissions were made by or on behalf of Community purchasers or processors of the product.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:

- La Cornubia, SA, Bordeaux, France,
- NV Metallo-chimique, Beerse, Belgium,
- Manica Spa, Rovereto, Italy.
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from all complainant Community producers, most exporters and some importers, and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
The investigation of dumping covered the period January to July 1986 inclusive.
B. Nomal Value
(5) In order to establish whether there was renewed dumping of imports of copper sulphate form Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR, the Commission had to take account of the fact that these countries do not have market economies and the Commission therefore had to base its determinations on the normal value in a market-economy country. In this connection, the Community industry had suggested the United States of America as an appropriate analogue market. All United States producers of copper sulphate known to the Commission were, however, unwilling to cooperate in the investigation. Some of the exporters concerned had objected to the use of the United States market, and one had suggested Thailand as being a more appropriate choice. Other exporters objected to the choice of Thailand arguing that the relatively small quantites produced in Thailand would result in high unit costs and commensurately higher prices. One exporter suggested the price acutally paid in the Community as an alternative basis for determining normal value.
(6) Following enquiries by the Commission, however, the results of which were substantiated by investigation at the permises of two Thai producers of copper sulphate, it was established that there were no extraordinary differences between Thai production processes and those of the exporting countries concerned. In addition, price levels in Thailand were somewhat lower than those in the Community and those alleged to exist in the United States, and, despite the relatively low quantites produced, were in reasonable proportion to production costs.
The Commission therefore concluded that it would be appropriate and not unreasonable to determine normal value on the basis of domestic prices in Thailand. Indeed, if Thailand cannot be ruled out as an analogue country then it is not legally appropriate to use Community prices as the basis for normal value.
The normal value thus established for the reference period was higher than that established during the previous investigations relating to the exporting countries concerned, the most significant factor having been the effect on prices of an increase in the cost of copper, which comprises the major element in the production costs of copper sulphate. This increase, together with increases in the Community producers' fixed costs, considerably outweighed the beneficial effects on these producer's costs of a reduction in the cost of energy.
C. Export price
(7) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(8) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. In particular, account was taken of differences in purity and copper content, sufficient evidence of which was supplied by the Polish and USSR exporters.
In all comparisons, account was taken of differences in conditions and terms of payment, and adjustment was made, where appropriate, to allow export prices and normal values to be on a comparable basis in this respect.
E. Margins
(9) The above preliminary examination of the facts showed the existence of dumping in respect of imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeded the prices for export to the Community. These margins varied according to the exporter concerned and, expressed as a percentage of total cif values for each of the exporters investigated, were as follows:
- Czechoslovakia: 25,6 %,
- Hungary: 45,5 %,
- Poland: 44,1 %,
- USSR: 47,9 %.
F. Injury
(10) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports into the Community from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR of copper sulphate have, on a cumulative basis, remained relatively stable between 1982 and 1986 and have accordingly retained a share of around 16 % of a market in which consumption in the Community has also been fairly stable.
(11) This situation should be considered in the light of the effect of the anti-dumping measures imposed between 1983 and 1985 on imports of copper sulphate originating in, inter alia, the four countries concerned in this proceeding. The evidence available to the Commission indicated that, while the imposition of anti-dumping measures may have had an initial downward effect on the sales volumes in the Community of the individual country or countries concerned, these volumes had, at least to some degree, recovered by the reference period.
(12) In addition, since the imposition of the existing anti-dumping measures relating to imports from the countries concerned, costs in the Community, particularly for copper, have increased significantly (see point 6). Thus, despite the imposition of these measures, the exporters concerned have been able to undercut significantly the prices of the Community producers. During the reference period, this undercutting reached levels of around 25 % after anti-dumping duty, and involved prices which were lower than those required to cover the costs of Community producers and provide a reasonable profit.
(13) The consequent impact on the Community industry has been that its sales in the Community have remained at approximately the same level from 1982 to 1986. This has meant a continuation of low capacity utilization levels which remained, on average, at 40 % during this period. The resultant high unit costs, combined with the depressive effect of the prices of the dumped imports, have led, for the complainant producers, to continued losses or the inability to obtain a reasonable return on sales in the Community market, which accounts for almost 90 % of their total sales of copper sulphate.
Furthermore, two Community producers have ceased production of copper sulphate since 1983, at least partially as a result of the impact of the dumped imports. These closures have led to a reduction in employment in the manufacture of copper sulphate in the Community.
(14) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as reduction in the complainant's sales to third countries, a fall in demand in the Community, or an increase in imports originating in countries other than those concerned in the present proceeding.
The complainant's sales to third countries remained stable between 1982 and 1986 at around 10 % of total sales. Community consumption has also remained relatively stable during this period. As regards imports from countries other than the four concerned, anti-dumping measures were taken in 1984 (1) concerning Bulgarian copper sulphate and, concerning the Yugoslav product, most recently in 1985 (2). Since these measures were taken, the volumes imported from these countries have fallen and imports from other countries have remained, as a whole, at approximately the same levels.
Thus, the volume of dumped imports from the four countries concerned and the prices at which they were sold in the Community during the reference period has led the Commission to determine that the effects of the dumped imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and the USSR, taken in isolation, have to be considered as causing material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interest
(15) In view of the serious difficulties facing the Community industry, and in particular the fact that two Community producers have ceased production since 1983, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken.
H. Undertakings and termination
(16) The Polish and USSR exporters concerned, having been informed of the main findings of the review investigation, offered undertakings, amended in the case of the Polish exporter, concerning their exports of copper sulphate to the Community. The effect of the said undertakings will be to increase export prices to the Community to the level which the Commission, having taken into account, on the one hand, the selling price necessary to provide an
adequate return to Community producers and, on the other hand, the purchase price to the Community importers and their costs and profit margin, considers necessary to eliminate injury. This increase does not exceed in either instance the dumping margin found in the investigation for each of the exporting countries concerned.
In these circumstances, the amended Polish undertaking and the USSR undertaking offered are considered acceptable and the investigation may, therefore, be terminated as regards imports form these countries without imposition of anti-dumping duties.
I. Duty
(17) The Czech and Hungarian exporters concerned, having been informed of the main findings of the review investigation, did not offer to amend undertakings in a manner which would eliminate the injury caused by the dumped imports. Accordingly, the Commission hereby withdraws its acceptance of these two undertakings and the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 2512/87 published in the Official Journal of the European Communities of even date with the publication hereof (1), has imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': '87/443/EEC: Commission Decision of 30 July 1987 amending an undertaking and accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping review investigation concerning imports of copper sulphate originating in Poland and the USSR respectively, and terminating the investigation as it concerns these countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 27 June 1984

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to the parties concerned to submit their comments and having regard to these comments,
Whereas:
I
The Greek Public Power Corporation (PPC) issued a tender for the construction of tranche IV (supply and installation of one steam-generating unit and one steam-turbine generator unit for a steam electric station) of the Megalopolis power station. The submission of the bids took place on 14 February 1984. As far as the Commission is aware, undertakings from at least three Member States - France, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom - have bid for this contract.
The tender calls for bids to be made in Greek drachmas with a price-revision formula provided for in the tender, the descriptions of which differ slightly. It appears that prices are to be calculated at the time of submission of contract. At the time of delivery, which is to be approximately four years later, the price will be adjusted in accordance with the price-revision clause, the basis of which appears to be the inflation rate of Greek drachmas. The new price then arrived at will be converted at the exchange rate valid at that date into the currency of the seller. The debt will then be the subject of a buyer credit.
Therefore, although the Greek inflation rate will be covered by the price-revision formula, the following risks remain for the seller:
- the inflation rate of the currency in which his offer is calculated, and
- the devaluation rate of the Greek drachma against the currency of the seller.
In January 1984, Hermes Kredit Versicherungs-AG, acting as agent for the German Government in export credit-insurance matters, was approached by a German bidder for the Magalopolis contract, requesting to be covered for the remaining exchange risk as, according to his information, his French competitors would receive such cover from the French Government. This was discussed in the Policy Coordination Group for Credit Insurance, Credit Guarantees and Financial Credits of the Council on 7 February 1984. The French delegation did not reply clearly. The Commission immedialety sent a telex to the French Government requesting full information. In the absence of a reply, a further telex was sent on 17 February 1984.
On 29 February 1984, the Commission received a reply from the French Government confirming its intention to cover their exporters against the exchange risk. On the same day, another discussion was held on the subject in the Council Group. The Greek delegation stated that the buyer would cover the exchange risk and that a written statement explaining the revision formula would be submitted by them. The French delegation declared that if the revision formula was sufficient, it would withdraw its offer to the French bidder.
The written statement by the Greek authorities was submitted on 1 March 1984. As it could not be ascertained whether or not the French Government would declare itself satisfied and therefore continue their offer to the French bidders to cover the remaining risk, the Commission decided to open the procedure pursuant to Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty on 8 March 1984 against the French Government's intention to cover French exporters against the remaining devaluation risk in respect of the contract for Megalopolis IV.
II
In the comments which it submitted to the Commission in the fremework of the procedure, the French Government argued that from the statement made by the Greek delegation at the meeting of the Council Group, it appeared that the price-revision mechanism established by the PPC did not cover the totality of the exchange risk as it referred exclusively to currency fluctuations of the Greek drachma and not to the currency in which the price of the materials used was expressed, nor to the evolution of the cost of labour.
The French Government further argued that it had not yet decided the practical terms of the special exchange-rate guarantee with which it intended to cover French exporters against the risks involved should they win the contract in question, and that it was therefore not able to communicate to the Commission the details of the scheme.
In the comments which they submitted to the Commission within the framework of the procedure, several other Governments of Member States expressed the opinion that the proposed French aid scheme for their exporters constituted an export aid which is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty and asked the Commission to take a decision to that effect.
III
A State aid which is granted to undertakings of one Member State to reduce a currency devaluation risk incurred by all competitors from different Member States bidding to obtain a contract for the sale of goods to be exported to another Member State constitutes an export aid.
With regard to export aids applied in intra-Community trade, the Commission has always held the view that they are incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty and do not fall within the scope of the exceptions laid down in Article 92 (3). This position found support by the Court of Justice in its judgment in joined cases 6 and 11/69 (1) (French preferential rediscount rate) and was reaffirmed on a number of occasions by the Commission.
In the present case, undertaking from at least three Member States are competing to win this contract. The conditions specified in the tender are applicable to all of them, i.e. prices have to be quoted in Greek drachmas and will be revised according to the specified formula after construction and delivery have taken place.
To meet the financial risk arising out of the special conditions laid down in the tender, the competing undertakings must make some provision in their offer to cover themselves against eventual exchange losses, i.e. they will have to increase their prices. If the Government of one Member State intervenes to take over this risk or part of it, the undertakings which receive this form of State aid benefit from an artificial competitive advantage which distorts competition and affects trade between Member States and is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the EEC Treaty irrespective of the rules governing the proposed aid. Derogations from the general principle of incompatibility are reserved to aids contributing to the attainment of one of the objectives to be pursued in the Community interest specified in the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3). This is not the case with regard to the aid which the French Government intends to grant French undertakings bidding for the Megalopolis contract. Such aid would, in fact, constitute an operating aid granted without any compensatory justification on the part of the beneficiaries and give the undertakings of one Member State a decisive advantage over their competitors from other Member States. Such practice violates the basic principles laid down in the EEC Treaty.
The question whether the PPC's price-revision clause covers all or part of the devaluation risks is irrelevant in examining this case,","{'title': ""84/416/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 June 1984 concerning the French Government's intention to accord special exchange risk cover to French exporters in respect of a tender for the construction of a power station in Greece"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe French Government shall not offer French exporters exchange-rate cover in respect of the tender for the construction of a power station in Greece (Megalopolis IV) as this constitutes an aid which is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty and does not fall within the scope of any of the exceptions laid down in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty, irrespective of the rules governing the proposed aid.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe French Government shall confirm to the Commission within four weeks of the date of this Decision that it will not provide exchange-risk cover for the contract referred to in Article 1.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 June 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) 1969 ECR, p. 523.'}]}"

(1) Directive 70/524/EEC requires that no additive may be put into circulation unless a Community authorisation has been granted.
(2) In the case of additives referred to in Part II of Annex C to Directive 70/524/EEC, which include micro-organisms, provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive in feedingstuffs may be given if the conditions laid down that Directive are satisfied and, if it is reasonable to assume, in view of the available results, that when used in animal nutrition, it has one of the effects referred to in Article 2(a) of that Directive. Such provisional authorisation may be given for a period not exceeding four years.
(3) This additive has already been authorised by Commission Regulation No 1411/1999/EC(3) for piglets, and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1636/1999(4) for calves and chickens for fattening.
(4) New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use to turkeys for fattening.
(5) The assessment of the application for authorisation submitted in respect of the micro-organism specified in the Annex to this Regulation, shows that the conditions referred to in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC are satisfied.
(6) The use of the Enterococcus faecium, specified in the Annex, should therefore be authorised on a provisional basis for a period of four years and be included in Chapter IV of the list of authorised additives.
(7) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition has delivered a favourable opinion on the safety of the use of that Enterococcus faecium, which is to be used in feedingstuffs for turkeys, under the conditions set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(8) The assessment of the application shows that certain procedures are required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annex. However, such protection is assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(5).
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1801/2003 of 14 October 2003 provisionally authorising the new use of a certain micro-organism in feedingstuffs (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe additive belonging to the group ""Micro-organisms"" referred to in the Annex is authorised for use as an additive in feedingstuffs under the conditions laid down in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 14 October 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 270, 14.12.1970, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 22, 25.1.2003, p. 28.\n\n(3) OJ L 164, 30.6.1999, p. 56.\n\n(4) OJ L 194, 27.7.1999, p. 17.\n\n(5) OJ L 183, 29.6.1989, p. 1.\n\nANNEX\n\n"">TABLE>""'}]}"

of 24 April 2003
fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 713/2003 of 24 April 2003 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 25 April 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 24 April 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(4) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(5) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 55.\n\n(6) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 25.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 24 April 2003 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1), as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1779/2002 (OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are as follows:\n\nC10 All destinations except for Estonia,\n\nC11 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia,\n\nC12 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Poland,\n\nC13 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary and Lithuania,\n\nC14 All destinations except for Estonia and Hungary,\n\nC15 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland,\n\nC16 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania,\n\nC17 All destinations except for Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia,\n\nC18 All destinations except for Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia,\n\nC19 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary and Slovenia,\n\nC20 All destinations except for Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania,\n\nC21 All destinations except for Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae(1), as last amended by Decision 2001/298/EC(2), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC describes the complement fixation test to be carried out for the diagnosis of African horse sickness.
(2) In November 2000 the Community reference laboratory in Algete, Spain, hosted the annual meeting of the national reference laboratories for African horse sickness of EU Member States. During this meeting scientific evidence was presented that the complement fixation test currently described in Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC has serious limitations in particular because it is only suitable for detecting antibodies after a recent infection or vaccination. Furthermore, the test is in practice replaced by modern ELISA tests in almost all laboratories in the Community and also in major exporting countries.
(3) The internationally accepted laboratory tests for the detection of antibodies against the African horse sickness virus are described in the Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines(3) of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE); however, the current edition mentions only one of the ELISA tests available.
(4) Therefore, it appears appropriate to modify Annex D to Directive 90/426/EEC so as to take into account technical developments and internationally approved standards.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,","{'title': '2002/160/EC: Commission Decision of 21 February 2002 amending Annex D to Council Directive 90/426/EEC with regard to diagnostic tests for African horse sickness (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 556)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex D to Directive 90/426/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 21 February 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 224, 18.8.1990, p. 42.\n\n(2) OJ L 102, 12.4.2001, p. 63.\n\n(3) Chapter 2.1.11., fourth edition 2000.\n\nANNEX\n\n""ANNEX D\n\nAFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nReagents for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) described below may be obtained from the European Community Reference Laboratory or the OIE Reference Laboratories for African horse sickness.\n\n1. COMPETITIVE ELISA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS VIRUS (AHSV) (PRESCRIBED TEST)\n\nCompetitive ELISA is used to detect specific AHSV antibodies in sera from any species of equidae. The broad spectrum, polyclonal, immune anti-AHSV guinea-pig serum (hereinafter ""guinea-pig antiserum"") is serogroup specific and is able to detect all known serotypes of AHS virus.\n\nThe principle of the test is the interruption of the reaction between AHSV antigen and a guinea-pig antiserum by a test serum sample. AHSV antibodies in the test serum sample will compete with those in the guinea-pig antiserum resulting in a reduction in the expected colour (following the addition of enzyme labelled anti-guinea-pig antibody and substrate). Sera can be tested at a single dilution of 1 in 5 (spot test method) or may be titrated (serum titration method) to give dilution end-points. Inhibition values higher than 50 % may be regarded as positive.\n\nThe test protocol described hereinafter is used in the Regional Reference Laboratory for African horse sickness in Pirbright, United Kingdom.\n\n1.1. Test procedure\n\n1.1.1. Preparation of plates\n\n1.1.1.1. Coat ELISA plates with AHSV antigen extracted from infected cell cultures and diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6. Incubate the ELISA plates overnight at 4 °C.\n\n1.1.1.2. Wash plates three times by flooding and emptying the wells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7,2 to 7,4 pH, and blot dry on adsorbent paper.\n\n1.1.2. Control wells\n\n1.1.2.1. Titrate the positive control sera in a twofold dilution series, from 1 in 5 to 1 in 640, across column 1 in blocking buffer (PBS containing 0,05 % (v/v) Tween-20, 5,0 % (w/v) skimmed-milk powder (Cadbury\'s MarvelTM) and 1 % (v/v) adult bovine serum) to give a final volume of 50 μl/well.\n\n1.1.2.2. Add 50 μl of the negative control serum at a dilution of 1 in 5 (10 μl serum + 40 μl blocking buffer) to wells A and B of column 2.\n\n1.1.2.3. Add 100 μl/well of blocking buffer to wells C and D of column 2 (blank).\n\n1.1.2.4. Add 50 μl of blocking buffer to wells E, F, G and H of column 2 (guinea pig control).\n\n1.1.3. Spot test method\n\n1.1.3.1. Add a 1 in 5 dilution of each test serum in blocking buffer to duplicate wells of columns 3 to 12 (10 μl sera + 40 μl blocking buffer).\n\nor\n\n1.1.4. Serum titration method\n\n1.1.4.1. Prepare a twofold dilution series of each test sample (1 in 5 to 1 in 640) in blocking buffer across eight wells of single columns (3 to 12).\n\nthen\n\n1.1.5. Add 50 μl of guinea pig antisera, pre-diluted in blocking buffer, to all wells except the blank wells of the ELISA plate (all wells now contain a final volume of 100 μl).\n\n1.1.5.1. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C on an orbital shaker.\n\n1.1.5.2. Wash plates three times and blot dry as before.\n\n1.1.5.3. Add 50 μl of rabbit anti-guinea-pig horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate pre-diluted in blocking buffer to each well.\n\n1.1.5.4. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C on an orbital shaker.\n\n1.1.5.5. Wash plates three times and blot dry as before.\n\n1.1.6. Chromogen\n\nPrepare the chromogen OPD (OPD = ortho-phenyldiamine) solution according to the manufacturers instructions (0,4 mg/ml in sterile distilled water) just before use. Add substrate (hydrogen peroxide = H2O2) to give a final concentration of 0,05 % (v/v) (1 in 2000 of a 30 % solution of H2O2). Add 50 μl of the OPD solution to each well and leave plates on the bench for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. Stop the reaction by the addition of 50 μl/well of 1M sulphuric acid (H2SO4).\n\n1.1.7. Reading\n\nRead spectrophotometrically at 492 nm.\n\n1.2. Expression of results\n\n1.2.1. Using a software package print out the optical density (OD) values, and the percentage inhibition (PI) for test and control sera based on the mean value recorded in the four guinea pig control wells. The data expressed as OD and PI values are used to determine whether the test has performed within acceptable limits. The upper control limits (UCL) and lower control limits (LCL) for the guinea pig control are between OD values 1,4 and 0,4 respectively. The end-point titre for the positive control based on 50 % PI should be 1 in 240 (within a range from 1 in 120 to 1 in 480). Any plate that fails to conform to the above criteria must be rejected. However, if the positive control serum titre is greater than 1 in 480 and the test samples are still negative then the negative test samples can be accepted.\n\nThe duplicate negative control serum wells and the duplicate blank wells should record PI values between + 25 % and - 25 %, and between + 95 % and + 105 %, respectively. Failure to be within these limits does not invalidate the plate but does suggest that background colour is developing.\n\n1.2.2. The diagnostic threshold (cut-off value) for test sera is 50 % (PI 50 %). Samples recording PI values greater than 50 % are recorded as positive. Samples recording PI values lower than 50 % are recorded as negative.\n\nSamples that record PI values above and below the threshold for the duplicate wells are considered doubtful. Such samples may be re-tested in the spot test and by titration. Positive samples may also be titrated to provide an indication of the degree of positivity.\n\nSpot test layout\n\n>TABLE>\n\n-ve cont= negative control.\n\n+ve cont= positive control.\n\nGP cont= guinea pig control.\n\nTest sera\n\n>TABLE>\n\n-ve cont= negative control.\n\n+ve cont= positive control.\n\nGP cont= guinea pig control.\n\n2. INDIRECT ELISA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS VIRUS (AHSV) (PRESCRIBED TEST)\n\nThe test described hereinafter is in accordance with the test description in Chapter 2.1.11 of the OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines, fourth edition, 2000.\n\nThe recombinant VP7 protein has been used as antigen for AHS virus antibody determination with a high index of sensitivity and specificity. Other advantages are that it is stable and not infective.\n\n2.1. Test procedure\n\n2.1.1. Solid phase\n\n2.1.1.1. ELISA plates are coated with recombinant AHSV-4 VP7 diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6. Incubate plates overnight at 4 °C.\n\n2.1.1.2. Wash the plates five times with distilled water containing 0,01 % (v/v) Tween 20 (washing solution). Gently tap the plates onto absorbent material to remove any residual wash.\n\n2.1.1.3. Block the plates with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) + 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk (Nestlé Dry Skim MilkTM), 200 μl/well, for 1 hour at 37 °C.\n\n2.1.1.4. Remove the blocking solution and gently tap the plates onto absorbent material.\n\n2.1.2. Test samples\n\n2.1.2.1. Serum samples to be tested, and positive and negative control sera, are diluted 1 in 25 in PBS + 5 % (w/v) skimmed milk + 0,05 % (v/v) Tween 20, 100 μl per well. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C.\n\nFor titration, make a twofold dilution series from 1 in 25 (100 μl/well), one serum per plate column, and do the same with positive and negative controls. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C.\n\n2.1.2.2. Wash the plates as described in step 2.1.1.2.\n\n2.1.3. Conjugate\n\n2.1.3.1. Dispense 100 μl/well of horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-horse gamma-globulin diluted in PBS + 5 % milk + 0,05 % Tween 20, pH 7,2. Incubate for 1 hour at 37 °C.\n\n2.1.3.2. Wash the plates as described in step 2.1.1.2.\n\n2.1.4. Cromogen/Substrate\n\n2.1.4.1. Add 200 μl/well of chromogen/substrate solution (10 ml of 80,6 mM DMAB (dimethyl aminobenzaldehyde) + 10 ml of 1,56 mM MBTH (3-methyl-2-benzo-thiazoline hydrazone hydrochlorid) + 5 μl H2O2)\n\nColour development is stopped by adding 50 μl of 3N H2SO4 after approximately 5 to 10 minutes (before the negative control begins to be coloured).\n\nOther chromogens such as ABTS (2,2\'-Azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]), TMB (tetramethyl benzidine), or OPD (ortho-phenyldiamine) can also be used.\n\n2.1.4.2. Read the plates at 600 nm (or 620 nm).\n\n2.2. Interpretation of the results\n\n2.2.1. Calculate the cut-off value by adding 0,6 to the value of the negative control (0,6 is the standard deviation derived with a group of 30 negative sera).\n\n2.2.2. Test samples giving absorbance values lower than the cut-off are regarded as negative.\n\n2.2.3. Test samples giving absorbance values greater than the cut-off + 0,15 are regarded as positive.\n\n2.2.4. Test samples giving intermediate absorbance values are doubtful and a second technique must be employed to confirm the result.\n\n3. BLOCKING ELISA FOR THE DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS VIRUS (AHSV) (PRESCRIBED TEST)\n\nThe blocking ELISA is designed to detect specific AHSV antibodies in sera from any susceptible species. VP7 is the major, antigenic, viral protein of AHSV, and is conserved within the nine serotypes. Because the monoclonal antibody (Mab) is also directed against the VP7, the assay will give a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Further, the recombinant VP7 antigen is completely innocuous and therefore guarantees a high degree of safety.\n\nThe principal of the test is the interruption of the reaction between the recombinant VP7, as the antigen bound to the ELISA plate and the conjugated Mab specific for the VP7. Antibody in the test sera will block the reaction between the antigen and the Mab resulting in a reduction in colour.\n\nThe test described hereinafter is carried out in the European Community Reference Laboratory for African horse sickness in Algete, Spain.\n\n3.1. Test procedure\n\n3.1.1. ELISA plates\n\n3.1.1.1. Coat ELISA plates with recombinant AHSV-4 VP7 diluted in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9,6. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n\n3.1.1.2. Wash the plates five times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 0,05 % (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST).\n\n3.1.1.3. Stabilise the plate by treatment with a stabilising solution (in order to allow long term storage at 4 °C without loss of activity) and blot dry onto adsorbent material.\n\n3.1.2. Test samples and controls\n\n3.1.2.1.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n3.1.2.2.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n3.1.3. Conjugate\n\nAdd 50 μl/well of pre-diluted horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated Mab (monoclonal antibodies specific for VP7) to each well and mix gently to ensure homogeneity. Incubate for 30 minutes at 37 °C.\n\n3.1.4. Wash the plates five times with PBST and blot dry as above.\n\n3.1.5. Chromogen/Substrate\n\nAdd 100 μl/well of chromogen/substrate solution (1 ml of ABTS (2,2\'-Azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid]) 5 mg/ml + 9 ml of substrate buffer (0,1 M Phosphate-Citrate buffer of pH 4 containing 0,03 % H2O2] and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. Colour development is stopped by adding 100 μl/well of 2 % (w/v) SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate).\n\n3.1.6. Reading\n\nRead at 405 nm in an ELISA reader.\n\n3.2. Interpretation of the results\n\n3.2.1. Assay validation\n\nThe test is valid when the optical density (OD) of negative control (NC) is higher than 1,0 and the OD of positive control (PC) is lower than 0,2.\n\n3.2.2. Cut-off calculation\n\nPositive cut-off=\n\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n\nNegative cut-off=\n\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n\nWhere, NC is the OD of the negative control and PC the OD of positive control.\n\n3.2.3. Interpretation of results\n\nSamples with OD lower than positive cut-off should be considered as positives to AHSV antibodies.\n\nSamples with OD higher than negative cut-off should be considered negatives for AHSV antibodies.\n\nSamples with OD between these two values should be considered doubtful and the animals re-sampled after two to three weeks.""'}]}"

Whereas in the Community and Italy in particular the production of certain vine propagating materials, i.e. slips and cuttings satisfying the requirements of Directive 68/193/EEC as regards variety, has been insufficient in 1996 and is therefore not adequate to meet that country's needs;

Whereas Italy should therefore be authorized to permit the marketing, for a period expiring on 28 February 1997, of slips and cuttings of a category to which less stringent requirements apply;
Whereas other Member States likely to supply Italy with such material should furthermore be authorized to permit its marketing to this end;

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 157(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) On 5 November 1997, the Commission adopted Decision 97/761/EC approving a support mechanism for the creation of transnational joint ventures for SMEs in the Community (3).
(2) The ETF Start-up Facility, the Joint European Venture (JEV) programme and the SME Guarantee Facility were measures provided for in Council Decision 98/347/EC of 19 May 1998 on measures of financial assistance for innovative and job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) — the growth and employment initiative (4).
(3) The multiannual programme set up by Decision 2000/819/EC (5), aims at improving the financial environment for business, in particular by improving the functioning of the ETF Start-up Facility, amending the SME Guarantee Facility and, with regard to JEV, by using, for the benefit of undertakings planning to enter into a transnational partnership, the commitments effected up until 31 December 2000 under Decision 98/347/EC.
(4) The purpose of the ETF Start-up Facility, JEV programme, and SME Guarantee Facility must be to efficiently address market failures in the access for SMEs to risk capital through enhancing participation of both private and public actors, with the aim of reaching distribution rates of 100 %.
(5) According to point IV of Annex II to Decision 2000/819/EC, experience has shown that the JEV programme needs to be simplified in order to enable SMEs' requests for financial contributions to be dealt with quickly by the financial intermediaries and Commission departments and to ensure that Community resources are used correctly. It was also stated that the Commission was examining the possibility of adapting the eligibility criteria in order to respond more effectively to the needs of SMEs with regard to cross-border investments, including those in applicant States.
(6) On 10 October 2002 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Growth and Employment Initiative — measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (6), where it notes that the JEV programme in its current form is no longer appropriate.
(7) The Commission's evaluation of the Growth and Employment Initiative as at 29 May 2002 concludes that the take-up of the JEV programme by the market is low, the job creation effect limited and the administrative cost very high and that JEV should be phased out as soon as possible.
(8) For reasons of cost-efficiency, the Community should withdraw progressively from programmes that involve micro-management of small amounts of money, as is the case with the projects financed under the JEV programme.
(9) After careful analysis, it has to be concluded that a substantial simplification of the JEV programme is not possible, since any substantial change to the structure or eligibility criteria of the programme would change its nature and therefore be outside the scope of the legal basis (Decision 98/347/EC). Therefore it would not be possible to use the remaining committed budget nor would it be possible to use the budget for projects involving the then accession countries and the candidate countries.
(10) The budget for the JEV programme was committed on the basis of framework agreements signed with the financial intermediaries in the JEV network, thus creating a direct legal relationship between the Commission and these intermediaries. Therefore a replacement of these existing framework agreements with direct legal agreements between the Commission and SMEs, which, in this particular programme, would have resulted in simplification and improved protection of the financial interests of the Community, is not possible.
(11) Only relatively minor procedural changes would be possible without losing the remaining committed budget, and these are deemed to be insufficient to ensure that the JEV programme performs significantly better.
(12) It is not possible to use the remaining committed budget for projects involving the then accession countries and the candidate countries, since this budget was committed under the Growth and Employment Initiative (1998-2000) and is therefore reserved exclusively for those states that are members of the European Union and European Economic Area, as provided by Decision 98/347/EC.
(13) Since the phasing-out of the other two European transnational joint venture programmes — European Community Investment Partners (ECIP) for the developing countries in Asia, Latin America, the Mediterranean region and South Africa (ALAMEDSA countries) in 1999 and the Programme to promote SME joint ventures and other joint agreements (JOP) in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and New Independent States (NIS) in 2000 — many financial intermediaries in the JEV network have scaled down or ceased this activity because of the low volume of JEV applications from SMEs with the result that in the majority of Member States, in reality, it is no longer possible to apply for participation in the programme.
(14) In view of the clear conclusion of the evaluation, it is not considered appropriate to propose replacing the JEV programme with a similar one.
(15) The phasing-out of the JEV programme should not affect the rights and obligations of the Community, the financial intermediaries or the beneficiaries (SMEs) that relate to approved projects.
(16) In observance of their legitimate expectations, the financial intermediaries should be allowed to present applications for financial contributions for SMEs for a certain period after this Decision has been adopted.
(17) On 23 October 2003 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on entrepreneurship in Europe, where it calls for the establishment of systems allowing improved access, in particular for small and micro-enterprises, to European Investment Bank/European Investment Fund funds for investments in new technologies and investments linked to training.
(18) For the purpose of promoting innovation, research and development and entrepreneurship by SMEs, as requested by the Barcelona Council, an environment favourable to private sector investment in research and development, in particular through venture capital, should be encouraged.
(19) The Commission has committed itself to reforming the existing multiannual programme for enterprise and entrepreneurship in due time taking into account the necessity of promoting cooperation between enterprises and business organisations and of supporting dialogue between horizontal and sectoral or professional organisations of small and micro-enterprises and craft enterprises.
(20) The Council of 26 November 2002 stated that Member States, the Commission and financial institutions should consider how to improve the financial framework for biotechnologies.
(21) The European Parliament requested, in its resolution on life sciences and biotechnologies of 21 November 2002 (7), that the Commission should identify how to overcome the issue of insufficient funding regarding biotech start-ups and asked the European Investment Bank to give favourable consideration to follow-up actions.

It was also stated that the Commission was examining the possibility of adapting the eligibility criteria in order to respond more effectively to the needs of SMEs with regard to cross-border investments, including those in applicant States.\n\n((6)) On 10 October 2002 the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on Growth and Employment Initiative — measures on financial assistance for innovative and job-creating small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)(6), where it notes that the JEV programme in its current form is no longer appropriate.\n\n((7)) The Commission's evaluation of the Growth and Employment Initiative as at 29 May 2002 concludes that the take-up of the JEV programme by the market is low, the job creation effect limited and the administrative cost very high and that JEV should be phased out as soon as possible.\n\n((8)) For reasons of cost-efficiency, the Community should withdraw progressively from programmes that involve micro-management of small amounts of money, as is the case with the projects financed under the JEV programme.\n\n((9)) After careful analysis, it has to be concluded that a substantial simplification of the JEV programme is not possible, since any substantial change to the structure or eligibility criteria of the programme would change its nature and therefore be outside the scope of the legal basis (Decision 98/347/EC). Therefore it would not be possible to use the remaining committed budget nor would it be possible to use the budget for projects involving the then accession countries and the candidate countries.\n\n((10)) The budget for the JEV programme was committed on the basis of framework agreements signed with the financial intermediaries in the JEV network, thus creating a direct legal relationship between the Commission and these intermediaries.\xa0Therefore a replacement of these existing framework agreements with direct legal agreements between the Commission and SMEs, which, in this particular programme, would have resulted in simplification and improved protection of the financial interests of the Community, is not possible.\n\n((11)) Only relatively minor procedural changes would be possible without losing the remaining committed budget, and these are deemed to be insufficient to ensure that the JEV programme performs significantly better.\n\n((12)) It is not

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) 1599/1999(2), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as ""the product concerned"") falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 originating in India. The measures took the form of ad valorem duties of between 0 and 35,4 % on individual exporters with a residual duty of 48,8 %.
B. CURRENT PROCEDURE
1. Request for review
(2) After the definitive measures had been imposed, the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (hereinafter referred to as ""the basic Regulation""), from two Indian producers of the product concerned, Sindia Steels Limited and Nevatia Steel &  Alloys Private Limited (""Nevatia""), both located in Mumbai. The companies concerned claimed that they were not related to any other exporting producers of the product concerned in India. Furthermore, they claimed that they had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998), but had exported the product concerned to the Community since then.
2. Initiation of an accelerated review
(3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the two Indian exporting producers concerned and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by a notice in the Official Journal(3), an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the companies concerned and commenced its investigation.
3. Product concerned
(4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999.
4. Parties concerned
(5) The Commission officially advised the two companies concerned and the Government of India (GOI). Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However, no such request was received by the Commission.
The Commission sent a questionnaire to the companies concerned and received full replies within the deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out verification visits at the premises of the companies concerned.
5. Investigation period
(6) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 1999 (hereinafter referred to as ""the investigation period"").
6. Methodology
(7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the current investigation.
C. SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
(8) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made in this investigation, this review was limited to subsidisation.
(9) The Commission examined the same subsidy schemes which were analysed in the original investigation. It was also examined whether the exporting producers had used any subsidy schemes which were alleged in the original complaint but not used during the original investigation.
It was finally examined whether the exporting producers had made use of any subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period, or had received ad hoc subsidies after this date.
D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. Withdrawal of request for review
(10) During the investigation, one company, Nevatia, withdrew its request for an accelerated review. Therefore, the investigation regarding this company shall be terminated. Consequently, the further analysis only refers to the other request for an accelerated review, i.e. by Sindia Steels Limited.
2. New exporter qualification
(11) The investigation confirmed that Sindia Steels Limited had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation and that they had begun exporting to the Community after this period.
Furthermore, Sindia Steels Limited was able to demonstrate satisfactorily that it did not have any links, direct or indirect, with any of the Indian exporting producers subject to the countervailing measures in force with regard to the product concerned.
Accordingly, it is confirmed that Sindia Steels Limited should be considered as a new exporter in accordance with Article 20 of the basic Regulation, since it was not individually investigated during the original investigation for reasons other than a refusal to cooperate with the Commission, and thus an individual countervailing duty rate should be determined for it.
3. Subsidisation
(12) On the basis of the information contained in the replies to the Commission's questionnaire, the following five schemes were investigated:
- Passbook Scheme,
- Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme,
- Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme,
- Export Processing Zones/Export Oriented Units,
- Income Tax Scheme.
4. Passbook Scheme (PBS)
(13) Sindia Steels Limited had not availed itself of the Passbook Scheme which, on 1 April 1997, i.e. during the original investigation period, was abolished and replaced by its successor, the Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB).
5. Duty Entitlement Passbook Scheme (DEPB)
General
(14) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had received benefits under this scheme. This company made use of the DEPB on a post-export basis.
Under this scheme, any eligible exporter can apply for credits which are calculated as a percentage of the value of exported finished products. Such DEPB rates have been established by the Indian authorities for most products, including the products concerned, on the basis of the Standard Input/Output Norms (SION). A licence stating the amount of credit granted is issued automatically.
DEPB on post-export basis allows for the use of such credits for any subsequent imports (e.g. raw materials or capital goods) except for goods the importation of which is restricted or prohibited. Such imported goods can be sold on the domestic market (subject to sales tax) or used otherwise.
DEPB credits are freely transferable. The DEPB licence is valid for a period of 12 months from the date on which the licence is granted.
(15) The characteristics of the DEPB have not changed since the original investigation. The scheme is a subsidy contingent upon export performance, and it was therefore determined during the original investigation that it is deemed to be specific and countervailable under Article 3(4)(a) of the Basic Regulation.
Calculation of the subsidy amount
(16) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited did not use the licences to make duty-free imports. Instead this company sold some of its licences, and the benefit was calculated on the basis of the amount of credit in the licence regardless of the sale price of the licence. The company claimed that the benefit should be limited to the effective sale price of the licence, which is often less than the face value of the credits in the licence. However, in accordance with the findings in the initial investigation (Commission Regulation (EC) No 618/1999(4), recital 34, as confirmed by Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999), this claim cannot be granted since the sale of a licence at a price less than the face value is a purely commercial decision which does not alter the countervailable benefit from this scheme.
As in the original investigation, the total value of the subsidy has been allocated over total exports in the investigation period. Where the company made duly substantiated claims for deductions linked to the payment of fees for obtaining the DEPB Licence, these were granted.
Sindia Steels Limited benefited from this scheme during the investigation period and obtained subsidies of 15,5 %.
6. Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCGS)
General
(17) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had availed itself of this scheme.
To benefit from the scheme, a company must provide to the relevant authorities details of the type and value of capital goods which are to be imported. Depending on the level of export commitment which the company is prepared to undertake, the company will be allowed to import capital goods at either a zero rate of duty or a reduced rate. A licence authorising the import at preferential rates is issued automatically.
In order to meet the export obligation, goods exported must have been produced using the imported capital goods.
An application fee is payable to obtain a licence.
(18) The characteristics of the EPCGS have not changed since the original investigation. It was determined during the original investigation that the EPCGS is a countervailable subsidy, as the payment by an exporter of a reduced or zero rate of duty constitutes a financial contribution by the GOI, government revenue otherwise due being foregone, and a benefit is conferred on the recipient by lowering the duties payable or fully exempting him from paying the import duties.
The subsidy is contingent in law upon export performance within the meaning of Article 3(4)(a) of the basic Regulation, since it cannot be obtained without a commitment to export goods, and is therefore deemed to be specific and countervailable.
Calculation of the subsidy amount
(19) Using the same calculation methodology as in the original investigation, the benefit to the exporter has been calculated on the basis of the amount of unpaid customs duty due on imported capital goods by spreading this amount across a period which reflects the normal depreciation of such capital goods in the industry of the product concerned. This period has been established by using the weighted average (on the basis of production volume of the products concerned) of depreciation periods for capital goods actually imported under the EPCGS by Indian producers during the original investigation period, resulting in a normal depreciation period of 15,5 years. This amount has then been allocated over total exports during the investigation period.
(20) Sindia Steels Limited obtained a benefit under this scheme of 0,3 %.
7. Export Processing Zones (EPZ)/Export Oriented Units (EOU)
(21) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited was not located in an EPZ and was not an EOU.
8. Income Tax Exemption Scheme (ITES)
(22) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had not availed itself of the ITES.
9. Other schemes
(23) It was established that Sindia Steels Limited had neither made use of new subsidy schemes which were established after the end of the original investigation period, nor had it received any ad hoc subsidies after this date.
10. Amount of countervailable subsidies
(24) Taking account of the definitive findings relating to the various schemes as set out above, the amount of countervailable subsidies for Sindia Steels Limited is as follows:
>TABLE>
E. AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED
(25) Based on the findings made during the investigation, it is considered that imports into the Community of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more produced and exported by Sindia Steels Limited should be subject to a level of countervailing duty corresponding to individual amounts of subsidies established for this company.
(26) Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.
F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURE
(27) The company concerned has been informed on the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to propose that Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 be amended, and was given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received.
(28) The review carried out does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 will expire pursuant to Article 18(1) of the basic Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 164/2002 of 28 January 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter of 1 mm or more, originating in India', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following shall be inserted into the table in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999: "">TABLE>""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 concerning imports by Nevatia Steel &  Alloys Private Limited of stainless steel wires with a diameter of 1 mm or more originating in India is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 January 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

(1) It is necessary to adapt the Common Consular Instructions on Visas and the Common Manual in order to facilitate the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1091/2001 of 28 May 2001 on freedom of movement with a long-stay visa(3).
(2) This Decision builds on the Schengen acquis, in accordance with the Protocol integrating it into the framework of the European Union, as laid down by Annex A to Council Decision 1999/435/EC of 20 May 1999 concerning the definition of the Schengen acquis for the purpose of determining, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the acquis(4).
(3) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not participating in the adoption of this instrument, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Decision aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Decision whether it will transpose it into its national law.
(4) As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Decision constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded on 18 May 1999 by the Council of the European Union and those two States(5).
(5) Pursuant to Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland and the United Kingdom are not participating in the adoption of this Decision.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 702/2010
of 4 August 2010
entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Olomoucké tvarůžky (PGI))
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Czech Republic’s application to register the name ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2).
(2) Germany, on 7 January 2008, and Austria, on 31 January 2008 and 4 February 2008, submitted objections to the registration under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The objections were deemed admissible under points (a), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) By letters dated 6 May 2008, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.
(4) Given that no agreement was reached between the Czech Republic and Austria nor between the Czech Republic and Germany within the designated time-frame, the Commission should adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(5) Concerning the alleged failure of compliance with Article 2 in respect of the lack of specificity of the product, the product specification sets out details relating to the production process and characteristics of the final product, in particular the organoleptic characteristics thereof, that do not give rise to there being any manifest error.
(6) Regarding the objection that pursuant to Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 only a group shall be entitled to apply for registration it is to be noted that in the present case the applicant group was a single company that met the conditions for filing an application set out in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2006 (3), which lays down detailed rules of implementation of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Moreover, the applicant is the only producer in the designated region and the only producer of such a cheese in that area or its surrounding areas.
(7) The terms ‘Olmützer Quargel’ and ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ were found to be names of similar cheeses in German and Czech languages respectively and that the terms have common historic origins referring to the town of Olomouc in the Czech Republic. The statements of objection from Austria showed that trade marks including the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ had been registered prior to the application for registration of the term ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ as a protected geographical indication. As the names have common origins and given the visual similarities between the products, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, and in particular point (b) of paragraph 1 thereof, could have the result that ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, if registered, would be found by a competent court to be protected against the use of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’. The evidence therefore shows that the continued existence of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’ would be jeopardised by the registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Moreover, the evidence shows that the use of the name ‘Olmützer Quargel’ referred to a product having a common origin with ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, but was generally not meant to exploit the reputation of the latter name. For these reasons, and in the interests of fairness and traditional usage, the maximum transitional period foreseen by Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should be foreseen.
(8) Concerning trade marks containing the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ that were protected through registration or acquired by use prior to the application for registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’, the conditions of Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 not being met, the said trade marks cannot be invalidated nor can their continued use be hindered by virtue of the registration of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ as a protected geographical indication, provided the general requirements under trademark legislation are otherwise met.
(9) The prohibition on registration of names that have become generic laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 refers to the whole name proposed for registration. This does not prevent the registration of a name composed of more than one part, even if a component part of the name or a translation thereof may have generic status, provided the name as a whole has not become generic. Furthermore, a statement of objection pursuant to Article 7(3)(d) of the said Regulation, regarding the generic status of a name, is limited to the name for which registration is requested. While the name proposed for registration is ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ the evidence provided in the statements of objection referred to the alleged general use of the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ in Germany and Austria, and not to that of ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’. No evidence has been provided in the statements of objection to show general usage comprising or including the name proposed for registration.
(10) Whereas protection is granted for the term ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ as a whole, the non-geographical component of that term may be used, and used in translation, throughout the Union, provided the principles and rules applicable in the Union’s legal order are respected.
(11) In the light of the above, the name ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ should be entered in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications subject to a transitional period of five years during which time the term ‘Olmützer Quargel’ may continue to be used in circumstances that, but for the transitional period, could be contrary to the protection provided for by Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,","{'header': '5.8.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 203/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 702/2010\nof 4 August 2010\nentering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Olomoucké tvarůžky (PGI))', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Czech Republic’s application to register the name ‘Olomoucké tvarůžky’ was published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2).\n\n((2)) Germany, on 7 January 2008, and Austria, on 31 January 2008 and 4 February 2008, submitted objections to the registration under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 18(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For chlorantraniliprole (DPX E-2Y45) MRLs are set in Part A of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
(2) In accordance with Article 8(4) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2), on 23 August 2010 France notified to the Commission the temporary authorisation of a plant protection product containing chlorantraniliprole (DPX E-2Y45) to be used on carrots to control carrot flies, a danger that was unforeseeable and could not be contained by any other means. Consequently, France has notified to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) in accordance with Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 that it has authorised the placing on the market in its territory of carrots containing pesticide residues higher than the applicable MRL. France also submitted an appropriate risk assessment concluding that such carrots do not constitute an unacceptable risk, in particular that the proposed increased residue level does not lead to a risk for any consumer.
(3) The Authority assessed the risk assessment submitted by France, examining in particular the risks to the consumer and where relevant to animals. The Authority gave a reasoned opinion on the proposed MRL (3). In this opinion the Authority found the proposed MRL acceptable with regard to consumer safety on the basis of a consumer exposure assessment for 27 specific European consumer groups.
(4) Based on the reasoned opinion of the Authority and taking into account the factors relevant to the matter, it is considered that the proposed MRL fulfils the requirements of Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 governing the compensation were amended with effect from 13 November 1988 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3468/88 (3); whereas that date divides into two periods the last calendar quarter of 1988;
Whereas the compensation is granted, under certain conditions, to Community tuna producer's organizations in respect of quantities of tuna delivered to the canning industry, during period for which prices were recorded, where the average quarterly price recorded on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price are both lower than 93 % of the Community producer price;
Whereas under these arrangements the situation on the Community market should be examined in order to determine the maximum amount of the compensation, in accordance with the first and second indents of Article 17 a (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81, for the period 13 November to 31 December 1988; whereas this examination has shown that for some species and presentations of the product in question, during the period concerned, both the average quarterly market price and the free-at-frontier price referred to in Article 17 a of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 were lower than 93 % of the Community producer price in force as determined by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3765/87 of 14 December 1987 fixing the Community producer price for tuna intended for the canning industry for the 1988 fishing year (4);
Whereas the quantities eligible for compensation, within the meaning of Article 17 a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81, may not under any circumstances exceed, for the quarter concerned, the limite laid down in paragraph 4 of that Article;
Whereas in the case of albacore weighing more than 10 kilograms none of those limits is exceeded and consequently there is no need to determine the maximum quantities in respect of which the allowance may be granted;
Whereas in the case of albacore weighing not more than 10 kilograms, on the other hand, the quantities sold and delivered during the period concerned within the meaning of Article 17 a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 were greater than those sold and delivered during the same period of the preceding three fishing years as referred to in the second indent of paragraph 4 of that Article; whereas they should therefore be limited to the average of the quantities sold and delivered during the same period of the fishing years 1985, 1986 and 1987 and the quantities granted to each producers' organization should be determined in accordance with Article 17 a (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Articles 40(1)(g) and 40(2)(d) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 39(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (2) provides that the intervention agencies may sell sugar only after a decision to that effect has been adopted by the Commission.
(2) Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden have intervention stocks of sugar. In order to respond to market needs, it is appropriate to open a standing invitation to tender to make these stocks available for export.
(3) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, no export refund should be fixed for the countries of the western Balkans.
(4) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to fix a maximum export refund for each partial invitation to tender.
(5) The intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden should communicate the tenders to the Commission. The tenderers should remain anonymous.
(6) Pursuant to Article 42(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, the price to be paid by the successful tenderer should be determined by the invitation to tender.
(7) Pursuant to Article 42(2)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006, it is appropriate to determine the period of validity of the export licences.
(8) In order to ensure proper management of sugar in storage, provision should be made for a communication from the Member States to the Commission on the quantities actually sold and exported.
(9) The second paragraph of Article 59 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards the buying-in and sale of sugar by intervention agencies (3) continues to apply to sugar accepted into intervention before 10 February 2006. However, for the resale of intervention sugar, this distinction is unnecessary and its implementation would create administrative difficulties for the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to exclude the application of Regulation (EC) No 1262/2001 to the resale of intervention sugar pursuant to this Regulation.
(10) The quantities available for a Member State that can be awarded when the Commission fixes the maximum export refund should take into account the quantities awarded pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1039/2006 of 7 July 2006 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of sugar held by the intervention agencies of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Germany, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden (4).

(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in the Republic of Croatia to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The provisions of Croatian legislation on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular the Veterinary Directorate (VD) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from Croatia. In particular these rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) Pursuant to Article 11(4)(c) of Directive 91/493/EEC a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores must be drawn up, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the points 1 to 7 of Annex II to Council Directive 92/48/EEC(3) must also be drawn up.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For acequinocyl the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2003/636/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 17 March 2003 an application from Agro-Kanesho Co. Ltd for the inclusion of the active substance acequinocyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2003/636/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State, the Netherlands, submitted a draft assessment report on 8 March 2005. In accordance with Article 11(6) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 (4) additional information was requested from the applicant on 13 July 2011. The evaluation of the additional data by the Netherlands was submitted in the format of an updated draft assessment report in November 2011.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion (5) on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance acequinocyl on 19 April 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 20 March 2014 in the format of the Commission review report for acequinocyl.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing acequinocyl may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve acequinocyl.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing acequinocyl. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (6) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (7) should be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '15.5.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 143/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 496/2014\nof 14 May 2014\napproving the active substance acequinocyl, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No\xa0540/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC(2)is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011.

The evaluation of the additional data by the Netherlands was submitted in the format of an updated draft assessment report in November 2011.\n\n((4)) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion(5)on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance acequinocyl on 19 April 2013. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 20 March 2014 in the format of the Commission review report for acequinocyl.\n\n((5)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing acequinocyl may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve acequinocyl.\n\n((6)) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n\n((7)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n\n((8)) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing acequinocyl. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((9)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(6)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((10)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(7)should be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nApproval of active substance\nThe active substance acequinocyl, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Re-evaluation of plant protection products', 'text': 'Article 2\nRe-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing acequinocyl as an active substance by 28 February 2015.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing acequinocyl as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances, all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 31 August 2014 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(2), first subparagraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(2) The European Commission was recently made aware that high levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China. Melamine is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of amino resins and plastics and is used as a monomer and as an additive for plastics. High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.
(3) Imports of milk and milk products, including milk powder, originating from China are not allowed into the Community; however, certain composite products (i.e. products which contain at the same time a processed product of animal origin and a product of non-animal origin) containing processed milk components might have reached the European Union's markets.
(4) Although factual information available indicates that no composite products are imported which are intended for the particular nutritional uses of infants or young children, certain such composite products, depending of their specific formulation and in particular on the proportion of milk product content, could have been presented for import without undergoing systematic border checks pursuant to Decision 2007/275/EC concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC. Taking into account that such products represent the primary, and in some cases sole, source of nourishment for infants and young children, it is appropriate to prohibit the import into the Community of any such products originating from China.
(5) As regards other composite products (such as biscuits and chocolate), which are only a minor part of a varied diet, after a request from the European Commission for an assessment of the risks related to the presence of melamine in composite product, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a statement in which it concludes that the highest risk would be represented by a worst case scenario according to which children with high daily consumption of biscuits and chocolate containing the highest proportion of milk powder (which varies between 16 % and more than 20 %), with a contamination equal to the highest level found in milk powder from China, could potentially exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of melamine (0.5 mg/kg body weight).
(6) In order to counter the risk for health that may result from exposure to the melamine content of such composite products, Member States should ensure that all composite products containing at least 15 % of milk product, originating from China, are systematically tested before import into the Community and that all such products which are shown to contain melamine in excess of 2,5 mg/kg are immediately destroyed. This maximum level responds to the need to ensure a large margin of safety. Precaution suggests that composite products, whose milk product content cannot be established, should also be tested. Member States should also ensure that composite products which are already present in the Community are appropriately tested and withdrawn from the market if necessary. The costs of tests at import and of official measures taken as regards products found to be non-compliant with the maximum level in question should be borne by the food business operator responsible for the products.
(7) In order for the Commission to be able to reassess appropriateness of these measures, Member States should inform the Commission of unfavourable results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed and should report favourable results on a two-week basis.
(8) Given the urgency, pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and after having informed the Chinese authorities, it is appropriate to adopt these interim protection measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(2), first subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
(9) This Decision shall be reviewed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(2), second subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002,","{'header': '27.9.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 259/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 26 September 2008\nimposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China\n(notified under document number C(2008) 5599)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/757/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.\n\n((2)) The European Commission was recently made aware that high levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China. Melamine is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of amino resins and plastics and is used as a monomer and as an additive for plastics. High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.\n\n((3)) Imports of milk and milk products, including milk powder, originating from China are not allowed into the Community; however, certain composite products (i.e. products which contain at the same time a processed product of animal origin and a product of non-animal origin) containing processed milk components might have reached the European Union's markets.\n\n((4)) Although factual information available indicates that no composite products are imported which are intended for the particular nutritional uses of infants or young children, certain such composite products, depending of their specific formulation and in particular on the proportion of milk product content, could have been presented for import without undergoing systematic border checks pursuant to Decision 2007/275/EC concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC.

Whereas:
(1) The Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies bought in olive oil before 1 November 1998 under the arrangements for intervention buying-in. The legal basis for those arrangements was repealed with effect from 1 November 1998 by Regulation (EC) No 1638/98. The Italian intervention agency still has certain quantities of lampante virgin olive oil in stock. To ensure a smooth transition from the intervention buying-in arrangements to the current situation in which such arrangements no longer exist and in order to dispose of any quantity still available at the Community intervention centres, authorisation should be given for the sale of olive oil bought in by the Italian intervention agency under the repealed arrangements and still in stock in Italy.
(2) Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 of 23 November 1978 on intervention in the olive oil sector(3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2203/90(4), lays down that the sale of olive oil held by intervention agencies must be by tender.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2960/77 of 23 December 1977 on detailed rules for the sale of olive oil held by intervention agencies(5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3818/85(6), lays down the conditions for the sale by tender of olive oil on the Community market and for export.
(4) Special rules must be laid down to ensure that the operations are properly carried out and monitored.
(5) To that end the Member State concerned must provide for all appropriate additional measures compatible with the provisions in force to ensure that the operations run smoothly and that the Commission is kept informed.
(6) The monitoring arrangements should accordingly be supplemented by allowing a reference sample to be taken.

(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 87/1999(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.

However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 22 April 1988
concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB (Deutschland) GmbH)
(Only the German text is authentic)
(88/328/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection againsted dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) On 19 July 1984, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 (3), a definitive anti-dumping duty of 33,89 % was imposed on imports of certain ball bearings manufactured and exported by the Minebea group of companies and originating in Singapore.
(2) In 1985 and 1986 NMB (Deutschland) GmbH, Neu Isenburg, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese mother company of the Minebea group, applied, on a regular basis, for the refund of anti-dumping duties amounting in total to DM . . . (4) paid on imports of the ball bearings during the two years in question. This amount represents part of the anti-dumping duties paid; a refund of the remainder was not requested.
(3) Following submissions by the applicant, additional information on certain costs, prices, commercial conditions and commercial activities of the Minebea group outside Singapore was requested by the Commission on the basis of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (5) (hereinafter referred to as Notice). The applicant complied with all requests for additional information to the satisfaction of the Commission. Subsequently, the applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunity to comment on it. It did so, and the comments were taken into consideration prior to this Decision.
(4) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. No Member State disagreed with this opinion.
B. Argument of the applicant
(5) The applicant has based its claims on the allegation that, for certain sales in the Community, export prices were such that either dumping did not exist or that dumping existed at a level lower than the level of the definitive duty of 33,89 %.
C. Admissibility
(6) The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular that concerning time limits.
D. Merits of the claim
(7) The applications are founded in part; for the rest they are unfounded. According to Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, anti-dumping duties paid by an importer shall be reimbursed if the importer shows that the duty collected exceeds the actual dumping margin, consideration being given to any application of weighted averages. Pursuant to Article 16 (1) and Part II of the Notice the applicant proved that the duty collected exceeded the actual dumping margin to varying degrees depending on the shipment and the bearing type partly as a result of normal value having decreased. To this extent the applications were founded and the applicant agrees with the Commission's calculation. The amount to be refunded is DM . . . .
(8) The applicant requests, however, the refund of an additional amount. For the determination of this additional amount, the applicant agrees with the Commission that, when calculating the dumping margin for the purpose of establishing whether it was exceeded by the level of duty or not, the export prices have to be constructed in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84.
Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale, including customs duties, any anti-dumping duties and other taxes, and for a reasonable profit margin.
The applicant maintains, however, that in constructing the export price, the anti-dumping duty should not be deducted; this would then result in a lower dumping margin for the refund calculation and consequently in a higher amount to be refunded.
The applicant justifies its request by claiming that, as a result of the Commission's position, imports by independent importers are treated differently from imports by related importers.
The Commission has evaluated this argument; it does not find it acceptable.
It is of the opinion that the wording of Article 2 (8) (b) is clear: all duties, including anti-dumping duties have to be deducted from the resale price. The Commission would, therefore, by granting the applicant's request, infringe the express requirement of Article 2 (8) (b) and of Part II 2 (b) and (c) of the Notice. Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 establishes different rules for the determination of the export price in different situations depending on whether the importer is related to the exporter or not. This cannot be considered discriminatory.
The second essential argument by the applicant, who sold on a duty-paid basis, is that a simple increase of its resale price in the Community by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty, would not allow it to qualify for a refund. The Commission stresses that, had the applicant sold on a duty unpaid basis, a single increase would have been sufficient to allow it to qualify for a refund.
Even where, as in the applicant's situation, the imported product was resold in the Community on a duty-paid basis, only one increase of the resale price by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty is necessary, provided that the Commission is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case under consideration this increase in the price paid by the independent buyer eliminates or reduces the dumping margin and does not represent merely the anti-dumping duty which the importer could pass back to its customer if it obtained a refund. This could be the case, for example, if either the costs incurred between importation and resale by NMB or Minebea's normal value had been reduced since the original investigation period. In addition, other changes in circumstances could require the application of different adjustment or calculation methods which could lead to the same result, i.e. the elimination or reduction of the dumping margin by a single price increase. In the present case there is no evidence that these conditions are met.
For these reasons the applicant's request for the refund of an additional amount has to be rejected,","{'title': '88/328/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 April 1988 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB (Deutschland) GmbH) (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale, including customs duties, any anti-dumping duties and other taxes, and for a reasonable profit margin.', 'text': ""Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale, including customs duties, any anti-dumping duties and other taxes, and for a reasonable profit margin.\n\nThe applicant maintains, however, that in constructing the export price, the anti-dumping duty should not be deducted; this would then result in a lower dumping margin for the refund calculation and consequently in a higher amount to be refunded.\n\nThe applicant justifies its request by claiming that, as a result of the Commission's position, imports by independent importers are treated differently from imports by related importers.\n\nThe Commission has evaluated this argument; it does not find it acceptable.\n\nIt is of the opinion that the wording of Article 2 (8) (b) is clear: all duties, including anti-dumping duties have to be deducted from the resale price.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 16a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, if, during a marketing year, intervention measures taken for mandarins and satsumas involve quantities exceeding the intervention thresholds fixed for those products and for that  marketing year, the basic and buying-in prices fixed for those products for the following marketing year are to be reduced by 1 % for each 3 000 tonnes in the case of mandarins and each 3 100 tonnes in the case of satsumas by which those thresholds are  exceeded;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1123/89 of 27 April 1989 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2601/69 with respect to the processing aid scheme and amending the rules for applying the intervention thresholds for certain citrus  fruits (7), the quantities of mandarins and satsumas delivered for processing under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2601/69 (8) are to be treated in the same way as a quantity qualifying for an intervention measure for the ascertainment of any overrun in  the intervention threshold;
Whereas, according to information supplied by the Member States, the intervention measures taken by the Community for the 1991/92 marketing year related to 95 278 tonnes for mandarins and 156 529 tonnes for satsumas; whereas the Commission therefore  notes an overrun in the intervention thresholds fixed for that marketing year of 59 478 tonnes for mandarins and 122 029 tonnes for satsumas;
Whereas, consequently, the basic and buying-in prices for mandarins and satsumas for the 1992/93 marketing year, as fixed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1378/92 of 21 May 1992 fixing for the 1992/93 marketing year certain prices and other amounts in the  fruit and vegetables sector (9), must be reduced by 19 % for mandarins and by 20 % for satsumas; whereas the reductions must be added to those resulting from the monetary realignments of 13 to 17 September 1992; whereas the resulting total reduction is  19,21 % for mandarins and 20,21 % for satsumas;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 18b (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, withdrawals on the territory of the former German Democratic Republic before the end of the 1991/92 marketing year are not to be taken into consideration in determining whether  intervention thresholds have been exceeded;

","COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2705/98 of 14 December 1998 on the determination of prices of adult bovine animals on representative Community markets and the survey of prices of certain other cattle in the Community
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1633/98 (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas, to help in determining the movement of prices on the market, the price on the representative markets of the Community must be derived from the prices recorded on the representative market or markets of each Member State for the various categories of bovine animals, taking into account the relative quantity of each of these categories and the relative size of the cattle population of each Member State;
Whereas the price recorded on the representative markets of the Community may be taken as the average of the prices of the bovine animals in question on the representative market or markets of each Member State; whereas this average should be weighted in accordance with the coefficients expressing the relative size of the cattle population of each Member State for each category marketed in a reference period;
Whereas the representative market or markets for each Member State should be selected on the basis of experience in recent years; whereas, moreover, where there is more than one representative market in a Member State the arithmetic average of the quotations recorded on these markets should be taken; whereas, in view of the experience gained, the markets of Luxembourg, Austria, Sweden and Finland should be excluded from the determination of prices in the Community because of the low representativity of the prices for live bovine animals in those Member States;
Whereas the price recorded on the market is based on the quotations, excluding tax, for live cattle; whereas, in certain Member States, the quotations are based on the quotations for meat; whereas a coefficient must therefore be fixed to convert these quotations;
Whereas, when the prices are recorded on the representative markets of the United Kingdom, allowance must be made for the relative importance of cattle farming as between Great Britain and Northern Ireland; whereas, to this end, the average price of adult bovine animals recorded on the markets of Great Britain and the average price of adult bovine animals recorded on the markets of Northern Ireland should be corrected by a coefficient reflecting the scale of production in these two regions of the United Kingdom;
Whereas to have a complete picture of the market situation at all times, it is necessary to know the prices of certain categories of cattle with a live weight of 300 kilograms or less;
Whereas Member States may, because of veterinary or health protection regulations, find it necessary to take measures which affect quotations; whereas, in such circumstances, it is not always suitable when recording market prices to take into account quotations which do not reflect the normal trend of the market; whereas, consequently, certain criteria should be laid down allowing the Commission to take account of that situation;
Whereas, to monitor better the Community market for categories of bovine animals other than adult bovines, provision should be made for a survey of prices for these categories; whereas for the Member States representative of these different types of bovine animals, Annexes III to V detailing the information to be provided for the price survey for each of these bovine animal categories should be established;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 610/77 of 18 March 1977 on the determination of prices of adult bovine animals on representative Community markets and the survey of prices of certain other cattle in the Community (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3270/94 (4), should be repealed;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2), and in particular Articles 9 and 11 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Measures in force
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2735/90 (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 610/95 (4), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China falling within CN code 2611 00 00.
2. Request for a review
(2) Following the publication in February 1995 of a Notice of the impending expiry (5) of the measures in force, the Commission received in June 1995 a request for a review lodged by EuromĂŠtaux, on behalf of the totality of Community producers of the product concerned. The request contained evidence that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures would be likely to result in a continuation or recurrence of dumping and injury which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping review.
(3) On 21 September 1995, the Commission announced, by a Notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6), the initiation of a review of Regulation (EEC) No 2735/90 and commenced an investigation pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 (7), which was replaced during the investigation by Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`).
3. Investigation
(4) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the Community producers of the initiation of the review, and gave the parties concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time-limit set in the Notice referred to in recital 3.
(5) The present review exceeded the period of one year within which it should normally have been concluded pursuant to Article 11(5) of the Basic Regulation, since two other reviews concerning tungsten products, namely tungstic oxide and acid on the one hand, and tungsten carbide and fused carbide on the other hand, were carried out in parallel. In view of the links between the products in the production chain, it was decided to submit the results of all these investigations at the same time.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST FOR AN EXPIRY REVIEW AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) In the course of the investigation, the complainant, EuromĂŠtaux, formally withdrew its request for the expiry review in view of a recent considerable decrease in imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China.
(7) In accordance with Article 11(5) in conjunction with Article 9(1) of the Basic Regulation, when the Community industry withdraws its request for an expiry review, the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would support the continuation of the proceeding.
(8) Therefore, interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(9) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.
(10) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that the continuation of protective measures is unnecessary and that the proceeding should be terminated,","{'title': ""98/229/EC: Commission Decision of 20 March 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of tungsten ores and concentrates originating in the People's Republic of China""}"

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 provides for the possibility of adopting common marketing standards for fishery products in the Community, particularly in order to keep products of unsatisfactory quality off the market and to facilitate trade  relations based on fair competition;
Whereas the adoption of such standards for preserved sardines is likely to improve the profitability of sardine production in the Community, and the market outlets therefor, and to facilitate disposal of the products;
Whereas it must be specified in this context, particularly in order to ensure market transparency, that the products concerned must be prepared exclusively with fish of the species ´Sardina pilchardus Walbaum' and must contain a minimum quantity of  fish;
Whereas, in order to ensure good market presentation, the criteria for the preparation of the fish prior to packaging, the presentations in which it may be marketed and the covering media and additional ingredients which may be used should be laid down;  whereas these criteria must not, however, be such as to preclude the introduction of new products on to the market;
Whereas, to prevent the marketing of unsatisfactory products, certain criteria which preserved sardines must satisfy in order to be marketed in the Community for human consumption should be defined;

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 30 October 2014
on the equivalence of the regulatory framework of Hong Kong for central counterparties to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories
(2014/754/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (1) and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The procedure for recognition of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) established in third countries set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 aims to allow CCPs established and authorised in third countries whose regulatory standards are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the Union. That recognition procedure and the equivalence decision provided for therein thus contribute to the achievement of the overarching aim of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 to reduce systemic risk by extending the use of safe and sound CCPs to clear over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts, including where those CCPs are established and authorised in a third country.
(2) In order for a third country legal regime to be considered equivalent to the legal regime of the Union in respect of CCPs, the substantial outcome of the applicable legal and supervisory arrangements should be equivalent to Union requirements in respect of the regulatory objectives they achieve. The purpose of this equivalence assessment is therefore to verify that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong ensure that CCPs established and authorised therein do not expose clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to a higher level of risk than the latter could be exposed to by CCPs authorised in the Union and, consequently, do not pose unacceptable levels of systemic risk in the Union.
(3) On 1 September 2013, the Commission received the technical advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) on the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs authorised in Hong Kong. The technical advice identified a number of differences between the legally binding requirements applicable, at a jurisdictional level, to CCPs in Hong Kong and the legally binding requirements applicable to CCPs under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. This Decision is not only based, however, on a comparative analysis of the legally binding requirements applicable to CCPs in Hong Kong, but also on an assessment of the outcome of those requirements, and their adequacy to mitigate the risks that clearing members and trading venues established in the Union may be exposed to in a manner considered equivalent to the outcome of the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The significantly lower risks inherent in clearing activities carried out in financial markets that are smaller than the Union financial market should thereby, in particular, be taken into account.
(4) In accordance with Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, three conditions need to be fulfilled in order to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country regarding CCPs authorised therein are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation.
(5) According to the first condition, CCPs authorised in a third country must comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(6) The legally binding requirements of Hong Kong for CCPs authorised therein consist of the Clearing and Settlement Systems Ordinance (‘CSSO’) and the Securities and Futures Ordinance (‘SFO’). Entities authorised under the CSSO are regulated by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (‘HKMA’) and entities authorised under the SFO are regulated by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (‘SFC’). CCPs in Hong Kong have been authorised under the SFO only. This Decision should be therefore limited to the regime set out under the SFO.
(7) Under Part III of the SFO, the SFC has the power to authorise CCP as a Recognised Clearing House (‘RCH’). When considering the authorisation of a CCP as an RCH, the SFC must take the ‘interest of the investing public’ and the ‘proper regulation of markets’ into account. The SFC may also specify ‘such conditions as it considers appropriate’ before authorising a specific CCP as an RCH and may change those conditions by notice if ‘satisfied that it is appropriate’. In determining what is appropriate, the SFC is required to refer to its statutory mandates of maintaining financial stability and reducing systemic risk.
(8) The SFO sets out the duties and requirements with which an RCH must comply. The SFC issued guidelines pursuant to Section 399(1) of the SFO (‘the Guidelines’), which implement the international standards set out under the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (‘PFMIs’) issued in April 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2) (‘CPSS’) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (‘IOSCO’). When assessing whether RCHs comply with their obligations under the SFO, the SFC takes into account the Guidelines. Where an RCH fails to comply with its obligations under the SFO as complemented by the Guidelines, the SFC may adopt measures to remedy that situation.
(9) The SFO also requires an RCH to adopt internal rules and procedures as are necessary for the proper regulation of its clearing and settlement facilities and for the proper regulation of its clearing members. Requirements of the SFO and the Guidelines are thus implemented in the internal rules and procedures of the RCHs. Under the SFO, any internal rules and procedures adopted by an RCH and amendments thereto must be approved by the SFC.
(10) The legally binding requirements in Hong Kong therefore comprise a two-tiered structure. The core principles for RCHs set out in the SFO (the ‘primary rules’), set out the high-level standards with which RCHs must comply in order to obtain authorisation to provide clearing services in Hong Kong. Those primary rules comprise the first tier of the legally binding requirements in Hong Kong. In order to prove compliance with the primary rules, RCHs must submit their internal rules and procedures to the SFC for approval. Those internal rules and procedures comprise the second tier of the legally binding requirements in Hong Kong, which must provide prescriptive detail regarding the way in which the RCH will meet those standards in accordance with the Guidelines. Once approved by the SFC, the internal rules and procedures become legally binding upon the RCH.
(11) The equivalence assessment of the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to RCHs should also take account of the risk mitigation outcome that they ensure in terms of the level of risk to which clearing members and trading venues established in the Union are exposed to due to their participation in RCHs. The risk mitigation outcome is determined by both the level of risk inherent in the clearing activities carried out by the CCP concerned which depends on the size of financial market in which it operates, and the appropriateness of the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs to mitigate that level of risk. In order to achieve the same risk mitigation outcome, more stringent risk mitigation requirements are needed for CCPs carrying out their activities in bigger financial markets whose inherent level of risk is higher than for CCPs carrying out their activities in smaller financial markets whose inherent level of risk is lower.
(12) The size of the financial market in which RCHs carry out their clearing activities is significantly smaller than that in which CCPs established in the Union carry out theirs. In particular, over the past three years, the annual notional value of listed derivative contracts traded in Hong Kong represented less than 1 % of the annual notional value of listed derivative contracts traded in the Union. Over the same period, the market capitalisation of securities traded on exchange in Hong Kong represented on average less than 25 % of the Union's market capitalisation. Moreover, clearing by RCHs of more complex products like OTC derivatives is at an early stage since clearing services for OTC derivative contracts were only launched on 25 November 2013. Therefore, participation in RCHs exposes clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to significantly lower risks than their participation in CCPs authorised in the Union.
(13) The legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to RCHs may therefore be considered as equivalent where they are appropriate to mitigate that lower level of risk. The primary rules applicable to RCHs, complemented by their internal rules and procedures which implement the PFMIs, mitigate the lower level of risk existing in Hong Kong and achieve a risk mitigation outcome equivalent to that pursued by Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(14) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong ensure that RCHs authorised therein comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(15) According to the second condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong in respect of CCPs authorised therein must provide for effective supervision and enforcement of those CCPs on an ongoing basis.
(16) The SFC conducts ongoing monitoring of RCHs' compliance with risk management requirements through surveillance and risk-based examination procedures including testing of prudential requirements. The SFC has additional means to enforce compliance. In particular, the SFC has the power to direct RCHs to cease to provide or operate clearing or settlement facilities or to withdraw their authorisation. In addition, the SFC may also request RCHs to make certain amendments to their rules as deemed necessary, and is empowered to make such rule changes unilaterally where the RCH concerned does not comply with the request. The SFC has the power to request RCHs to provide books and records kept by them in connection with or for the purposes of their business or in respect of any clearing and settlement arrangements for any transactions in securities or futures contracts as well as other information relating to their business or any clearing and settlement arrangements for any transactions in securities or futures contracts that the SFC may reasonably require for the performance of its functions. Failure to provide that information or documentation, without reasonable justification, may result in the imposition of fines.
(17) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong in respect of CCPs authorised therein provide for effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis.
(18) According to the third condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong must include an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CCPs authorised under third-country legal regimes (‘third-country CCPs’).
(19) To operate as a CCP in Hong Kong, an entity is required to be designated either as a RCH or recognised as a provider of ‘Automated Trading Services’ (‘ATS’) under the SFO. ATS are defined as entities providing, by means of electronic facilities, services to trade or clear securities or futures contracts. In March 2014, the Hong Kong Legislative Council passed an Amendment Ordinance to expand the scope of the ATS definition to include OTC derivatives as well.
(20) The ATS regime is suited to third-country CCPs wishing to provide services to Hong Kong participants. Third-country CCPs may apply to be recognised in Hong Kong as ATS, enabling them to provide the same services in Hong Kong as they are authorised to provide in the third country.
(21) When processing the ATS application from a third-country CCP, the SFC assesses the compliance of the third-country CCP with the PFMIs as a benchmark. The conclusion of a memorandum of understanding between the SFC and the competent third-country supervisory authority of the applicant CCP is also required before the ATS application is approved as the SFC relies on the home regulator for day-to-day supervision of the third-country CCP.
(22) While noting that the structure of the recognition procedure of the legal regime of Hong Kong applicable to third-country CCPs differs from the procedure laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, it should nonetheless be considered as providing for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of third-country CCPs.
(23) The conditions laid down in Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 can therefore be considered to be met by the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong regarding RCHs, and those legal and supervisory arrangements should be considered to be equivalent to the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The Commission, informed by ESMA, should continue monitoring the evolution of the Hong Kong legal and supervisory framework for CCPs and the fulfilment of the conditions on the basis of which this decision has been taken.
(24) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,","{'header': '31.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 311/62', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 30 October 2014\non the equivalence of the regulatory framework of Hong Kong for central counterparties to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories\n(2014/754/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The procedure for recognition of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) established in third countries set out in Article\xa025 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 aims to allow CCPs established and authorised in third countries whose regulatory standards are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the Union. That recognition procedure and the equivalence decision provided for therein thus contribute to the achievement of the overarching aim of Regulation (EU) No\xa0648/2012 to reduce systemic risk by extending the use of safe and sound CCPs to clear over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts, including where those CCPs are established and authorised in a third country.\n\n((2)) In order for a third country legal regime to be considered equivalent to the legal regime of the Union in respect of CCPs, the substantial outcome of the applicable legal and supervisory arrangements should be equivalent to Union requirements in respect of the regulatory objectives they achieve. The purpose of this equivalence assessment is therefore to verify that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Hong Kong ensure that CCPs established and authorised therein do not expose clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to a higher level of risk than the latter could be exposed to by CCPs authorised in the Union and, consequently, do not pose unacceptable levels of systemic risk in the Union.\n\n((3)) On 1 September 2013, the Commission received the technical advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) on the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs authorised in Hong Kong. The technical advice identified a number of differences between the legally binding requirements applicable, at a jurisdictional level, to CCPs in Hong Kong and the legally binding requirements applicable to CCPs under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. This Decision is not only based, however, on a comparative analysis of the legally binding requirements applicable to CCPs in Hong Kong, but also on an assessment of the outcome of those requirements, and their adequacy to mitigate the risks that clearing members and trading venues established in the Union may be exposed to in a manner considered equivalent to the outcome of the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The significantly lower risks inherent in clearing activities carried out in financial markets that are smaller than the Union financial market should thereby, in particular, be taken into account.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, three conditions need to be fulfilled in order to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country regarding CCPs authorised therein are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation.\n\n((5)) According to the first condition, CCPs authorised in a third country must comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n\n((6)) The legally binding requirements of Hong Kong for CCPs authorised therein consist of the Clearing and Settlement Systems Ordinance (‘CSSO’) and the Securities and Futures Ordinance (‘SFO’).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular the third indent of Article 31(10) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The third indent of Article 31(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 stipulates that in the case of differentiated refunds the refund is to be paid on presentation of proof that the products have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund was fixed. Exceptions may be made to this rule in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 42 of the same Regulation, provided conditions are laid down which offer equivalent guarantees.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 351/2004 of 26 February 2004 fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products (2) has introduced refunds differentiated according to destination for all milk products from 27 February 2004.
(3) Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3) indicates which documents may serve as proof that customs formalities for importation have been completed in a third country in cases where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under that Article, the Commission may decide, in certain specific cases to be determined, that proof of import as referred to in that Article may be furnished by a specific document or in any other way.
(4) Since subjecting the payment of refunds to the requirements of Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 entails a substantial change in the administrative procedures for both the national authorities and exporters, it has administrative implications and represents a significant financial burden. Obtaining the proof referred to in Article 16 of that Regulation can pose considerable administrative difficulties in some countries. Furthermore, the particular conditions of export of dairy products may render obtaining such proofs even more difficult and burdensome.
(5) To alleviate some of the administrative and financial constraints imposed on exporters, and in order to allow the authorities and exporters to set up the new arrangements for the products concerned and introduce the procedures needed to ensure that all the formalities to be completed run smoothly, Commission Regulation (EC) No 519/2004 of 19 March 2004 derogating from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as regards exports of milk and milk products (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 450/2005 of 18 March 2005 on proof that customs formalities for importation of milk and milk products in third countries have been completed as provided for in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 (5) provide for a transitional period during which the proof that customs formalities for importation have been completed is made easier. That period expired on 31 December 2005.
(6) However, in many of the countries of destination appropriate procedures and adequate means to provide for the necessary documents are still not in place. In order to prevent traders from not being granted the export refund for that reason, it is necessary to continue to provide for a transitional regime for the year 2006. The transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 450/2005 have caused some confusion and interpretation questions among the national competent authorities. It is appropriate therefore to re-establish, for the year 2006, the transitional provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 519/2004, which have not caused any interpretation problem.
(7) It is appropriate to recall the provisions of Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 allowing the competent authorities of the Member States, in case any doubt exists as to the destination of the exported products, to require additional evidence for all refunds proving to their satisfaction that the product has actually been placed on the market in the importing third country.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.

The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.\n\n((5)) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.\n\n((6)) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.\n\n((7)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter(3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 29 June 2007.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 29 June 2007 to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n1\n)\n(EUR/100 kg)\nCN code\nDescription\nRate of refund\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\nex\xa00402\xa010\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content not exceeding 1,5\xa0% by weight (PG 2):\n(a)\non exportation of goods of CN code 3501\n—\n—\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n0,00\n0,00\nex\xa00402\xa021\xa019\nPowdered milk, in granules or other solid forms, not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter, with a fat content of 26\xa0% by weight (PG 3):\n(a)\nwhere goods incorporating, in the form of products assimilated to PG 3, reduced-price butter or cream obtained pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n0,00\n0,00\n(b)\non exportation of other goods\n0,00\n0,00\nex\xa00405\xa010\nButter, with a fat content by weight of 82\xa0% (PG 6):\n(a)\nwhere goods containing reduced-price butter or cream which have been manufactured in accordance with the conditions provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 are exported\n0,00\n0,00\n(b)\non exportation of goods of CN code 2106\xa090\xa098  containing 40\xa0% or more by weight of milk fat\n0,00\n0,00\n(c)\non exportation of other goods\n0,00\n0,00\n(\n1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to Andorra, Gibraltar, Ceuta, Melilla, Holy See (Vatican City State), Liechtenstein, the Communes of Livigno and Campione d’Italia, Heligoland, Greenland, the Faeröe Islands, the United States of America and the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control and to the goods listed in Tables I and II of Protocol 2 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation.'}]}"

of 16 April 2007
authorising the United Kingdom to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax
(2007/250/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 10 February 2006, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of values added tax: uniform basis of assessment (2).
(2) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 18 July 2006 of the request made by the United Kingdom. By letter dated 19 July 2006, the Commission notified the United Kingdom that it had all the information it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.
(3) Directive 77/388/EEC has been recast and repealed by Directive 2006/112/EC. References to the provisions of the former are to be construed as references to the latter.
(4) The person liable for payment of the value added tax (VAT), under Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, is the taxable person supplying the goods. The purpose of the derogation requested by the United Kingdom is to place that liability on the taxable person to whom the supplies are made, but only under certain conditions and exclusively in the case of mobile telephones and computer chips/microprocessors.
(5) Within that sector, a significant number of traders engage in tax evasion by not paying VAT to the tax authorities after selling the products. Their customers, however, being in receipt of a valid invoice, remain entitled to a tax deduction. In the most aggressive forms of this tax evasion, the same goods are, via a ‘carousel’ scheme, supplied several times without payment of the VAT to the tax authorities. By designating in those cases the person to whom the goods are supplied as the person liable for the VAT, the derogation would remove the opportunity to engage in that form of tax evasion. However, it would not affect the amount of VAT due.
(6) For the purposes of ensuring the effective operation of the derogation and preventing the tax evasion from being shifted to other products or towards the retail level, the United Kingdom should introduce appropriate control and reporting obligations. The Commission should be informed of the specific measures adopted, and the monitoring and overall evaluation of the operation of the derogation.
(7) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued since it is not intended to apply generally, but only to a specific high risk sector comprising certain carefully defined products in relation to which the scale and size of the tax evasion has resulted in considerable tax losses. Furthermore, since that sector is a small one, the derogation cannot be considered equivalent to a general measure.
(8) The authorisation should be valid only for a short period, because it cannot be ascertained with certainty that the objectives of the measure will be achieved, nor can the impact of the measure on the functioning of the VAT system in the United Kingdom and in other Member States be gauged in advance; moreover, the impact of the measure and its implementation on the functioning of the internal market will have to be properly assessed.
(9) The derogation has no negative impact on the Community’s own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '26.4.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 109/42', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 16 April 2007\nauthorising the United Kingdom to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2007/250/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In a letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 10 February 2006, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of values added tax: uniform basis of assessment(2).\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 18 July 2006 of the request made by the United Kingdom.

Whereas:
(1) Practical experience has shown that it is necessary to improve further the implementation of the information and promotion regime for third countries market as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2879/2000 (2).
(2) It is necessary to provide that each Member State designates the competent authority or authorities for the application of Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999. Member States should inform the Commission of the names and contact details of these authorities, so as to ensure that this information can be made available in a continuously updated list, made available to all interested parties via the internet.
(3) In order to evaluate and compare proposals of information and promotion programmes these proposals should be submitted according to a single format in all Member States.
(4) Practical experience has shown that the periods for Member States to conclude contracts with the selected professional or interprofessional organisations are too short, in particular in case where several such organisations in more than one Member State are involved. Those periods need therefore to be prolonged.
(5) The use of model contracts ensures that in all Member States the selected programmes are carried out under the same conditions. Where necessary, Member States should however be permitted to vary certain terms of the contracts in order to take account of national rules.
(6) It should be clarified that for multiannual programmes an internal report should be submitted after completion of each annual phase, even in cases where no application for payment is made.
(7) Practical experience has shown that the current requirements for circulation, four times a year, of quarterly reports between Member States and the Commission are too cumbersome. The Member States should be obliged to circulate those reports only twice a year.
(8) The interest rate to be paid by the beneficiary of an undue payment should be aligned with the interest rate for amounts receivable not repaid on the due date established in Article 86 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3).

(3) The total allowable catch of capelin in Greenland waters for 2000 has been set within a trilateral agreement among Greenland, Iceland and Norway at 975000 tonnes of which the quota accruing to Greenland is to be 107500 tonnes and consequentially the quota accruing to the Community has to be adapted.

(2) In particular, those products will be subject to the animal-health requirements laid down in Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(1), Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species(2), Council Directive 90/429/EEC of 26 June 1990 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species(3) and Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC(4).
(3) Certain of those animal products obtained in the New Member States before the date of Accession may be in stocks after the date of Accession. However, those animal products may not comply with all the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade.
(4) In order to facilitate the transition from the existing regime for products from the New Member States to that resulting from the application of the Community animal health legislation, it appears appropriate to lay down transitional measures for trade in those products.

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 makes provision for laying down common quality standards for bananas intended for consumption fresh, not including plantains; whereas the purpose of these standards is to ensure that the market is supplied with  products of uniform and satisfactory quality, in particular in the case of bananas harvested in the Community, for which efforts to improve quality should be made;
Whereas, given the wide range of varieties marketed in the Community and of marketing practices, minimum standards should be set for unripened green bananas, without prejudice to the later introduction of standards applicable at a different marketing  stage; whereas the characteristics of fig bananas and the way in which they are marketed are such that they should not be covered by the Community standards;
Whereas the banana-producing Member States already apply national standards within their territory at different stages in the marketing of bananas; whereas it seems appropriate, in view of the objectives pursued, to allow these existing rules to  continue to apply to their own production but only at stages subsequent to unripened green bananas, provided those rules are not in conflict with the Community standards and do not impede the free circulation of bananas in the Community;

DEFINITION OF PRODUCE\n\nThis standard applies to bananas of the varieties (cultivars) of Musa (AAA) spp., Cavendish and Gros Michel subgroups, referred to in Annex II, for supply fresh to the consumer after preparation and packaging. Plantains, bananas intended for industrial  processing and fig bananas are not covered.\n\nII. QUALITY\n\nThis standard defines the quality requirements to be met by unripened green bananas after preparation and packaging.\n\nA. Minimum requirements\n\nIn all classes, subject to the special provisions for each class and the tolerances allowed, the bananas must be:\n\n- green and unripened,\n\n- intact,\n\n- firm,\n\n- sound; produce affected by rotting or deterioration such as to make it unfit for consumption is excluded,\n\n- clean, practically free from visible foreign matter,\n\n- practically free from pests,\n\n- practically free from damage caused by pests,\n\n- with the stalk intact, without bending, fungal damage or dessication,\n\n- with pistils removed,\n\n- free from malformation or abnormal curvature of the fingers,\n\n- practically free from bruises,\n\n- practically free from damage due to low temperatures,\n\n- free from abnormal external moisture,\n\n- free from any foreign smell and/or taste.\n\nIn addition, hands and clusters (parts of hands) must include:\n\n- a sufficient portion of crown of normal colouring, sound and free from fungal contamination,\n\n- a cleanly cut crown, not beveled or torn, with no stalk fragments.\n\nThe physical development and ripeness of the bananas must be such as to enable them to:\n\n- withstand transport and handling,\n\nand\n\n- arrive in satisfactory condition at the place of destination in order to attain an appropriate degree of maturity after ripening.\n\nB. Classification\n\nBananas are classified into the three classes defined below:\n\n(i) 'Extra' class\n\nBananas in this class must be of superior quality. They must have the characteristics typical of the variety and/or commercial type.\n\nThe fingers must be free from defects, apart from slight superficial blemishes not covering a total of more than 1 cm2 of the surface of the finger, which must not impair the general appearance of the hand or cluster, its quality, its keeping quality or  the presentation of the package.\n\n(ii) Class I\n\nBananas in this class must be of good quality. They must display the characteristics typical of the variety and/or commercial type.\n\nHowever, the following slight defects of the fingers are allowed, provided they do not impair the general appearance of each hand or cluster, its quality, its keeping quality or the presentation of the package:\n\n- slight defects in shape,\n\n- slight skin defects due to rubbing and other slight superficial blemishes not covering a total of more than 2 cm2 of the surface of the finger.\n\nUnder no circumstances may such slight defects affect the flesh of the fruit.\n\n(iii) Class II\n\nThis class covers bananas which do not qualify for inclusion in the higher classes but satisfy the minimum requirements specified above.\n\nThe following defects of the fingers are allowed, provided the bananas retain their essential characteristics as regards quality, keeping quality and presentation:\n\n- defects of shape,\n\n- skin defects due to scraping, rubbing or other causes, provided that the total area affected does not cover more than 4 cm2 of the surface of the finger.\n\nUnder no circumstances may the defects affect the flesh of the fruit.\n\nIII. SIZING\n\nSizing is determined by:\n\n- the length of the edible pulp of the fruit, expressed in centimetres and measured along the convex face from the blossom end to the base of the peduncle,\n\n- the grade, i.e. the measurement, in millimetres, of the thickness of a transverse section of the fruit between the lateral faces and the middle, perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis.\n\nThe reference fruit for measurement of the length and grade is:\n\n- the median finger on the outer row of the hand,\n\n- the finger next to the cut sectioning the hand, on the outer row of the cluster.\n\nThe minimum length permitted is 14 cm and the minimum grade permitted is 27 mm.\n\nAs an exception to the last paragraph, bananas produced in Madeira, the Azores, the Algarve, Crete and Lakonia which are less than 14 cm in length may be marketed in the Community but must be classified in Class II.\n\nIV. TOLERANCES\n\nTolerances in respect of quality and size shall be allowed within each package in respect of produce not satisfying the requirements of the class indicated.\n\nA. Quality tolerances\n\n(i) 'Extra' class\n\n5 % by number or weight of bananas not satisfying the requirements for the 'extra' class but meeting those for Class I, or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n\n(ii) Class I\n\n10 % by number or weight of bananas not satisfying the requirements of Class I but meeting those for Class II, or, exceptionally, coming within the tolerances for that class.\n\n(iii) Class II\n\n10 % by number or weight of bananas satisfying neither the requirements for Class II nor the minimum requirements, with the exception of produce affected by rotting or any other deterioration rendering it unfit for consumption.\n\nB. Size tolerances\n\nFor all classes, 10 % by number of bananas not satisfying the sizing characteristics, up to a limit of 1 cm for the minimum length of 14 cm.\n\nV. PRESENTATION\n\nA. Uniformity\n\nThe contents of each package must be uniform and consist exclusively of bananas of the same origin, variety and/or commercial type, and quality.\n\nThe visible part of the contents of each package must be representative of the entire contents.\n\nB. Packaging\n\nThe bananas must be packed in such a way as to protect the produce properly.\n\nThe materials used inside the package must be new, clean and of a nature such as to avoid causing any external or internal deterioration of the produce. The use of materials such as, in particular, wrapping papers or adhesive labels bearing commercial  indications is allowed provided that the printing and labelling is done with a non-toxic ink or glue.\n\nPackages must be free from any foreign matter.\n\nC. Presentation\n\nThe bananas must be presented in hands or clusters (parts of hands) of at least four fingers.\n\nClusters with not more than two missing fingers are allowed, provided that the stalk is not torn but cleanly cut, without damage to the neighbouring fingers.\n\nNot more than one cluster of three fingers with the same characteristics as the other fruit in the package may be present per row.\n\nIn the producing regions, bananas may be marketed by the stem.\n\nVI. MARKING\n\nEach package must bear the following particulars in writing, all on the same side, legibly and indelibly marked and visible from the outside:\n\nA. Identification\n\nB. Nature of produce\n\n- The word 'Bananas' where the contents are not visible from the outside,\n\n- the name of the variety or commercial type.\n\nC. Origin of the product\n\nCountry of origin and, in the case of Community produce:\n\n- production area, and\n\n- (optionally) national, regional or local name.\n\nD. Commercial specifications\n\n- Class,\n\n- net weight,\n\n- size, expressed as minimum length and, optionally, as maximum length.\n\nE.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 85 thereof;
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 (1) of 6 February 1962, and in particular Article 2 thereof;
Having regard to the notification submitted as a precaution only on 31 January 1963 pursuant to Regulation No 17 by ""Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH"", a company established under German law at Frankfurt-on-Main (Germany), in respect of standard contracts for the sale of photographic products which it applied on the German domestic market;
Having regard to the publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities No C 122 of 24 November 1972 of the Summary of the notification pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17;
Having regard to the Opinion delivered on 27 March 1973 by the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Monopolies pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation No 17;
I
Whereas the notification submitted as a precaution only by Adox Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH in 1963 concerned contracts regularly awarded by that company since 1958 in Germany to specialized dealers, both wholesale and retail, wishing to sell one or more categories of the products it then manufactured (photographic films, paper and equipment ; photochemical products ; sensitive products for radiography ; accessories, etc);
Whereas under the terms of those standard contracts, concluded for a year with tacit renewal, German dealers undertook to observe strictly Adox's general conditions of sale for the category of products concerned, on pain of their deliveries being stopped, their annual rebates being withheld or financial penalties being imposed ; whereas in particular they expressly agreed to respect the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer and to ensure that these were respected by others ; whereas Adox, for its part, undertook to apply without exception its system of fixed prices, as provided for in the German law;
Whereas Adox's general conditions of sale, as they stood in 1963, included in particular:    (a) the requirement that both wholesalers and retailers should strictly apply the resale prices fixed by the manufacturer for each group of purchasers, irrespective of the origin of the products, and that they should not grant any discount whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly;
(b) the requirement that wholesalers should only supply retailers in Germany able to provide service to the branch's usual customers and who in turn should undertake to comply with the prices and distribution networks specified by the manufacturer;
(c) the requirement that retailers should deliver only to consumers, to the exclusion of any other dealer, and that they should not sell abroad without the manufacturer's permission;
Whereas in November 1969 the applicant company - which had meanwhile become Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH - discontinued of its own accord the fixed price system which it had been using on the German market and amended its general conditions of sale, in particular by abolishing the export ban imposed on its German dealers ; whereas in February 1971, following an intervention by the Commission, it also abolished the bans on wholesalers reselling to other wholesalers and on retailers reselling to other retailers;  (1)OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62 ; OJ Special edition 1959-62, November 1972, p. 87.
Whereas these general conditions of sale, thus amended, are being applied for products supplied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH which, in July 1971, took over Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH ; whereas cameras are no longer included in those products as the latter company ceased to manufacture them in 1965;
Whereas the Commission has not received any comments from third parties in response to the publication of the summary of the notification;
II
Whereas, under Article 2 of Regulation No 17, a negative clearance may be granted if the Commission finds, on the basis of facts in its possession, that there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty for action on its part in respect of the standard contracts and general conditions of sale in question;
Whereas those standard distribution contracts, as well as the general conditions of sale, which are of course subject to agreement between the supplier and each of its purchasers, are agreements between undertakings within the meaning of Article 85;
Whereas the standard distribution contracts which were concluded between specialized dealers and Fotowerke Dr. C. Schleussner GmbH, Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH or Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH no longer contain any obligation apart from the undertaking entered into by dealers to observe the manufacturer's general conditions of sale;
Whereas the present wording of ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Photochemical Products"" and ""General Conditions of Delivery and Payment for Equipment and Spare Parts"" applied by the ""Photographic Department"" of Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH both contain similar clauses relating, inter alia, to the placing of orders, the way of quoting prices, consignments, retention of ownership, conditions of payment, complaints, place of jurisdiction, etc.;
Whereas the conditions of sale for photochemical products contain the additional requirement that dealers should provide customers with the usual service of the branch and supply articles only in their original packaging ; whereas the conditions of sale for equipment and spare parts also stipulate that the warranty against manufacturing defects shall in all cases extend over a period of six months;
Whereas none of the aforementioned clauses is a direct or indirect restriction against competition among either distributors or consumers within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty ; whereas in particular, dealers, whether wholesale or retail, may deliver their goods to any purchasers, including purchasers outside German territory, at prices which they themselves have freely determined;
Whereas, consequently, the facts in the possession of the Commission do not show that the standard contracts and conditions of sale in question have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the Common Market within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the EEC Treaty ; whereas, since one of the conditions for applying that paragraph is not satisfied, negative clearance may be granted;
III
Whereas the standard contracts and conditions of sale as worded prior to February 1971 fell within the provisions of Article 85 (1) because they contained clauses which restricted competition and which might affect trade between Member States, in particular:    (a) a ban on exporting by wholesalers and retailers without the manufacturer's permission;
(b) a ban on resales at the same level of distribution, as regards exports within the EEC;
(c) a requirement to respect prices fixed by the manufacturer, as regards goods re-imported into Germany from other Member States of the EEC;
Whereas such clauses, which were the only ones prohibited under Article 85 (1) and were unlikely to be exempted under the provisions of Article 85 (3), were finally all eliminated in February 1971;
Whereas the agreements in question consequently satisfy the requirements of Article 7 (1) of Regulation No 17 ; whereas, in fact, those agreements, which were in existence when the said Regulation No 17 (13 March 1962) entered into force and which were notified within the time limits fixed in Article 5 (1) of that Regulation, do not satisfy the requirements of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty, but whereas Du Pont Fotowerke Adox GmbH has amended the said agreements so that they no longer fall within the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) ; whereas, as far as the versions of the contracts prior to modifications are concerned, the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) applies only to the period fixed by the Commission;
Whereas in this respect account should be taken of the fact that the abovementioned company abolished of its own accord two of the three restricitive clauses mentioned above and abolished the third clause as soon as the Commission so requested ; whereas these circumstances are sufficient to justify the non-application of the prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) for the entire period preceding the amendments;","{'title': '73/196/EEC: Commission Decision of 14 June 1973 relating to proceedings under Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/14.111 - Du Pont De Nemours Deutschland) (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nOn the basis of the facts in the possession of the Commission, there are no grounds under Article 85 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community for action on its part in respect of the standard contracts and general conditions of sale which are being applied by Du Pont de Nemours (Deutschland) GmbH for the distribution of products from its ""Photographic Department"".'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe prohibition contained in Article 85 (1) shall not apply to the versions of the standard contracts and general conditions of sale applied by Adox Fotowerke Dr. C.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2), and in particular Articles 12 (2) and 16 (6) thereof,
Whereas export licences for common wheat were issued on 16 November 1990 with advance fixing of the refund applicable to exports of common wheat to the Soviet Union; whereas the term of validity of those licences expires on 31 January 1991; whereas  failure to effect export by that date entails a loss of the security;
Whereas, because of its size, the whole quantity involved cannot be exported before the expiry of the term of validity of the licences owing to the considerable difficulties involved in maritime transport to the Soviet Union; whereas the Soviet Union is  also a major importer of cereals from the Community;
Whereas the quantities in question can no longer be placed in a customs warehouse under satisfactory conditions on expiry of the term of validity of the licences owing to a lack of immediately available storage capacity;
Whereas, because of the problems likely to be involved in transport to the Soviet Union, exporters who at 23 November 1990 had fixed refunds on exports of common wheat to the Soviet Union obtained, under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3633/90 (3), an  extension of one month in the term of validity; whereas, it accordingly seems justifiable to permit the same term of validity for exporters who had fixed export refunds at 16 November 1990 and who are encountering the same problem;
Whereas under these conditions and quite exceptionally the term of validity of licences should be extended by one month on application by the party concerned; whereas, in order to avoid any undue advantage, provision should however be made that in his  application the party concerned should forego the payment of the monthly increases in the export refund provided for in Article 16 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 for the extension period permitted in this Regulation;

Following consultation of the Fund Committee,
Whereas, in accordance with Article 5 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, the Commission, on the basis of the annual accounts presented by the Member States, clears the accounts relating to the expenditure paid by the authorities and bodies referred  to at Article 4 of the said Regulation;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, only expenditure effected in accordance with Community rules within the framework of the common organization of the agricultural markets, may be financed;
Whereas Italy has transmitted to the Commission the documents necessary for the clearance of accounts relating to the financial year 1991 in so far as expenditure covered by the present decision is concerned; whereas the Commission has carried out the  necessary verifications in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91 (3), provided for the supply of canned beef to the people of the ex-Soviet Union in the framework of Council Regulation (EEC) No 598/91 of 5 March 1991 on an emergency action for the Soviet Union (4);  whereas the processing and canning of the meat was awarded by tendering procedures; whereas the meat to be processed came from the intervention stocks of Germany;
Whereas a considerable part of the canned beef produced by certain Italian firms and supplied to the ex-USSR proved to be unfit for human consumption; whereas additionally, it was found that in certain cases the meat content of the cans did not  correspond to the specifications laid down in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91; whereas the affected canned beef not being identifiable by lot, the totality of the produce supplied had to be retrieved and will have to be destroyed; whereas the  deterioration of the produce was found to be due to the insufficiency of the sterilization operation for the meat to be processed and this is attributable to the producing firm; whereas the permanent physical controls which had to be effected in  accordance with Article 9 of the said Regulation did not allow the detection of the abovementioned procesing faults; whereas, in consequence, the Italian intervention agency incorrectly paid the processing costs to the successful tenderers and did not  acquire the securities constituted in accordance with Article 6 (3) of the aforementioned Regulation; whereas the associated positive and negative expenditure which was supported by the Fund in 1991 may no longer be taken in charge by the Community  budget;
Whereas the Member State in question has been informed in detail of the corrections provided for by this decision and has been able to make known its position on this subject;
Whereas Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1723/72 of 26 July 1972 on making up accounts for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 295/88 (6), provides that the  decision to clear accounts shall include the determination of the amount of expenditure incurred in each Member State during the financial year in question recognized as chargeable to the Guarantee Section of the Fund; whereas this provision does not  exclude the Commission from clearing, before and outside of the global decision on the clearance of accounts, certain parts of the annual accounts concerning expenditure relevant to specific measures; whereas in this particular case, having regard to  the gravity of the control weaknesses found and the pressing political necessity to replace the canned beef which is unfit for consumption, the Commission is led to avail itself of this facility; whereas this decision does not prejudice the clearance of  accounts decision for the 1991 financial year for the Member State concerned with regard to expenditure not covered by this decision;
Whereas the Commission reserves the possibility to proceed, within the appropriate legal framework, to the recovery of the expenses it has incurred which also result from the insufficient application by the Member State in question of the control  provisions in this particular case, in addition to those expenses which are the subject of this decision; whereas this concerns in particular the expenses linked to the loss of the intervention meat used, in so far as these expenses exceed the amount of  the securities released, as well as the costs of storage, re-transport and destruction of the canned beef;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 102 of the Financial Regulation, of 21 December 1977 (7), as last amended by Regulation (Euratom, ECSC, EEC) No 610/90 (8), the result of the clearance of accounts decision, constituting the difference between the  total of the expenditure booked for the financial year in question in application of Articles 100 and 101 and the total expenditure recognized by the Commission at the clearance, is booked under a single article as additional expenditure or a reduction  in expenditure,","{'title': '94/281/EC: Commission Decision of 29 April 1994 on the clearance of accounts of Italy for certain expenditure financed by European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section, for the financial year 1991 (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe amount recognized as chargeable to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, relative to the expenditure declared by Italy for the 1991 financial year for the execution of the operations provided for in  Regulation (EEC) No 1582/91, as identified in the Annex, amount, in accordance with the same Annex:\n\n- for Italy to Lit 15 772 655 660.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amounts set out at point 3 of the Annex are to be booked with the expenditure referred to at Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88 (9) for the month of April 1994.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to Italy.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 April 1994.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nRené STEICHEN\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 94, 28. 4. 1970, p. 13.\n\n(2) OJ No L 185, 15. 7. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ No L 147, 12. 6. 1991, p. 20.\n\n(4) OJ No L 67, 14. 3. 1991, p. 19.\n\n(5) OJ No L 186, 16. 8. 1972, p. 1.\n\n(6) OJ No L 30, 2. 2. 1988, p. 7.\n\n(7) OJ No L 356, 31. 12. 1977, p. 1.\n\n(8) OJ No L 70, 16. 3. 1990, p. 1.\n\n(9) OJ No L 249, 8. 9. 1988, p. 9.\n\nANNEX\n\nITALY  """" ID=""1"">1.

","COMMISSION  REGULATION (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the  grant of export refunds in the sugar sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of  the markets in the sugar sector  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1101/95  (2), and in  particular Article 17 (15) thereof;
Whereas the Agreement on Agriculture reached during the Uruguay Round multilateral trade  negotiations, hereinafter referred to as the 'Agreement`, requires in particular that the  regulations applicable to exports of sugar be adapted; whereas Title II (Trade with third  countries) of the basic Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 was revised as a result of that Agreement by  Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94  (3); whereas, consequently, the detailed rules of application  for granting export refunds on sugar laid down by Commission Regulations (EEC) No 394/70  (4), as  last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2529/94  (5), and (EEC) No 1469/77  (6), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 1714/88  (7), should also be reviewed, the Regulations being repealed while  those provisions still relevant to the application of the refund system are carried over;
Whereas candy sugar, which is manufactured from white sugar or refined raw sugar, very often has a  degree of polarization of less than 99,5  %; whereas, in view of the high degree of purity of the  raw material used, the refund on candy sugar should be as close as possible to the refund on white  sugar; whereas a precise definition of candy sugar should be laid down;
Whereas the intervention prices for white sugar and raw sugar are fixed without taking account of  the storage levy provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81; whereas, however,  account should be taken of the impact of that levy on sugar prices and the export refunds should be  determined accordingly;
Whereas, in order to ensure equal treatment of all parties concerned in the Community, a standard  method for determining the sucrose content of certain products should be laid down; whereas special  provisions must be laid down to cover cases where that method does not allow the total sucrose  content to be determined;
Whereas, in the case of syrups with a relatively low degree of purity, the sucrose content should  be fixed at a flat rate on the basis of the extractable sugar content;
Whereas exports of white sugar to third countries are more and more frequently preceded by storage  in bulk in port warehouses or silos, bagging being carried out at the last minute when the ship is  ready to be loaded or on board the vessel itself; whereas, as a result, such operations imply the  shared use at the port concerned of a silo in which sugar from various sugar companies is stored  and therefore mixed; whereas, as the regulations now stand, in order to qualify for advance payment  of refunds, since sugar must be stored under conditions permitting it to be identified physically,  mixing with other sugar is not permitted; whereas this situation thus prevents a major percentage  of Community sugar exported to third countries from qualifying for advance payment of export  refunds;
Whereas, furthermore, the special features of white sugar, namely its high degree of technical and  commercial homogeneity, make it possible to relax the regulatory constraints on that product while  still ensuring that the product is actually exported after payment of the refund; whereas, under  these circumstances, mixing white sugar from various sources at one place of storage should under  certain conditions (in particular subject to controls) be permitted for the purposes of the advance  payment of export refunds, by amending the relevant provisions on the sugar sector;
Whereas, with a view to granting export refunds on isoglucose and inulin syrup, limits should be  laid down as regards the fructose and polysaccharide content in order to ensure that the refund is  granted only on the true product as such; whereas, as regards inulin syrup, the production quotas  and production levies are established at the same level as for sugar and isoglucose by applying a  coefficient of 1,9; whereas, as a result, the refund on inulin syrup should be established using  that coefficient; whereas the export refund on isoglucose and inulin syrup should be fixed each  month in line with the monthly fixing of other refunds in the sugar sector;
Whereas it is economically desirable to provide for the possibility of refunds being adjusted in  cases where changes occur in the intervention prices and the price for molasses between the time  they are fixed and actual export;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the  Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, 'candy  sugar` means sugar which:\n\n(a)  comprises large crystals at least 5 mm in length, obtained by cooling and slow crystallization  of a sufficiently concentrated sugar solution,\n\nand (b)  contains 96  % or more sucrose by weight in the dry state, determined in accordance with the  polarimetric method.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of Articles 17a (2) (b) and 17c of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, the  export refund shall be fixed taking account of the storage levy referred to in Article 8 of  Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 which is fixed for the marketing year in question.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) By Commission Decision 89/471/EEC (2), the use of several methods for grading pig carcasses in Germany was authorised.
(2) Germany has stated that the update of the national formula is absolutely necessary in order to take into account the breeding progress during the past 15 years. The last update of the lean meat equation of the grading apparatus and the ‘Zwei-Punkt-Meßverfahren’ (ZP) method dates back to 1995.
(3) Germany has requested the Commission to authorise the replacement of the formulas used in the ‘General Electric Logiq 200pro’, the ‘Autofom I’ and ‘Zwei-Punkt-Meßverfahren’ (ZP) methods of grading pig carcasses as well as to authorise two new methods for grading pig carcasses on its territory and has presented a detailed description of the dissection trial, indicating the principles on which that method is based, the results of its dissection trial and the equations used for assessing the percentage of lean meat in the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcasses and the reporting of prices thereof (3).
(4) Examination of that request has revealed that the conditions for authorising those grading methods are fulfilled. Those grading methods should therefore be authorised in Germany.
(5) Decision 89/471/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) In view of the technical circumstances while introducing new devices and new equations, the methods for grading pig carcasses authorised under this Decision should apply from 4 October 2011.
(7) Modifications of the apparatus or grading methods should not be allowed, unless they are explicitly authorised by Commission Decision.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '29.4.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 110/29', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 27 April 2011\namending Decision 89/471/EEC authorising methods for grading pig carcasses in Germany\n(notified under document C(2011) 2709)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(2011/258/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Commission Decision 89/471/EEC(2), the use of several methods for grading pig carcasses in Germany was authorised.\n\n((2)) Germany has stated that the update of the national formula is absolutely necessary in order to take into account the breeding progress during the past 15 years.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 84/500/EEC of 15 October 1984 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs (2) is a specific measure within the meaning of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. It concerns the possible migration of lead and cadmium from ceramic articles which, in their finished state, are intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, or which are in contact with foodstuffs, and are intended for that purpose.
(2) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 provides that the specific measures are to require that materials and articles covered by those measures are accompanied by a written declaration stating that they comply with the rules applicable to them.
(3) That requirement has not yet been set out in Directive 84/500/EEC. There is a need to lay down that obligation for all ceramic articles which are not yet in contact with foodstuffs to clearly distinguish them from decorative articles.
(4) The national competent authorities should have access to documents demonstrating that the ceramic articles comply with the migration limits for lead and cadmium. Therefore, the manufacturer or importer into the Community should make information concerning analysis carried out available to them on request.
(5) Directive 84/500/EEC lays down a method for the analysis of lead and cadmium. Technological progress has been made in that area and the analytical method set out in that Directive is only one amongst several possible methods. This Directive should take technological progress into account and establish a set of performance criteria that the analytical method must comply with having regard to Commission Directive 2001/22/EC of 8 March 2001 laying down the sampling methods of analysis for the official control of the levels of lead, cadmium, mercury and 3-MCPD in foodstuffs (3).
(6) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of ensuring the free movement of ceramic articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs to lay down rules for a correct enforcement of Directive 84/500/EEC. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(7) Directive 84/500/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

General requirements\n\nThe measuring systems fitted to road tankers referred to in items 2.2 and 2.4 may obtain EEC pattern approval solely on the basis of an examination of the documents produced, if the latter are in conformity with one of the standard schemes referred to in item 4.2 and meet the requirements set out below:  4.1.1. Indication of the standard scheme adopted must be added to the markings specified in item 1.16.\n\n4.1.2. The components of the measuring system must have received EEC pattern approval when such approval is specified either in Directive 71/319/EEC of 26 July 1971 relating to meters for liquids other than water, Directive 71/348/EEC of 12 October 1971 relating to ancillary equipment for meters for liquids other than water or in this Directive.\n\n4.1.3. If a tank has several compartments, the outlet pipes from the compartments may be connected to a measuring system separately or through a manifold, unless otherwise specified in the relevant standard scheme. The provisions of the second paragraph of item 2.2.1 shall apply in all cases.\n\nWhere a measuring system is connected to several compartments through a manifold, there shall be a device for preventing several compartments from communicating with the measuring system simultaneously. This requirement does not, however, apply if the measuring system has a gas separator in conformity with item 1.6.2.1.4.\n\n4.1.4. If a road tanker has two measuring systems which can be connected as required to one or more specific compartments, the pipes and valves must be arranged so that the two measuring systems cannot be connected to the same compartments simultaneously. In addition, the connections between compartments and measuring systems must be clearly marked so as to prevent a compartment being mistakenly connected to a measuring system not designed to measure the product which it contains.\n\n4.1.5. If an anti-swirl device is specified requirement, it may be combined with the valve in the bottom of the compartment.\n\n4.1.6. The pipework, valves and taps between compartments and measuring systems must be arranged in such a way that it is impossible to connect a measuring system to a tank separate from the road tanker.\n\n4.1.7. The filter normally provided immediately upstream of the meter or the degassing equipment may be incorporated in the latter.\n\n4.1.8.

(notified under document number C(2005) 4611)

(2005/864/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 25 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2).
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (3), designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Endosulfan is one of the 89 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Spain, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 22 February 2000 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifiers Bayer CropScience and Makhteshim Agan as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92. It appeared that further data were required. Commission Decision 2001/810/EC (4) laid down a deadline for data submission by the notifier, which expired 25 May 2002. The same decision set a further deadline of 31 May 2003 for specified long term studies.
(6) The Commission organised a tripartite meeting with the main data submitters and the rapporteur Member State for this active substance on 17 May 2004.
(7) The assessment report prepared by Spain has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This review was finalised on 15 February 2005 in the format of the Commission review report for endosulfan.
(8) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of areas of concern have been identified. This was in particular the case concerning its environmental fate and behaviour as the route of degradation of the active substance is not completely clear and unknown metabolites were found in soil degradation, water/sediment degradation and mesocosm studies. In ecotoxicology many concerns remain since the long term risk, in particular, due to the presence of the abovementioned metabolites, cannot be sufficiently addressed with the available information. In addition exposure of operators under indoor conditions has not been considered to be sufficiently addressed with the available information. Moreover endosulfan is volatile, its main metabolite is persistent and it has been found in monitoring results of regions where the substance was not used. Consequently, as these concerns remain unsolved, assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing endosulfan satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) Endosulfan should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing endosulfan are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(11) In the light of the information submitted to the Commission it appears that, in the absence of efficient alternatives for certain limited uses in certain Member States, there is a need for further use of the active substance so as to enable the development of alternatives. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available for the control of harmful organisms.
(12) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing endosulfan allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(13) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances (5),
(14) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for endosulfan according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '3.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 317/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 2 December 2005\nconcerning the non-inclusion of endosulfan in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance\n(notified under document number C(2005) 4611)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/864/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 25 July 1993.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, the requirements of the Azores and Madeira for rice are to be covered in terms of quantity, price and quality by the mobilization, on disposal terms equivalent to exemption from the levy, of Community rice, which involves the grant of an aid for supplies of Community origin. This aid is to be fixed with particular reference to the costs of the various sources of supply and in particular is to be based on the prices applied to exports to third countries.
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1696/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2596/93(4), lays down common detailed rules for implementation of the specific arrangements for the supply of certain agricultural products, including rice, to the Azores and Madeira.

Whereas, by virtue of Regulations (EEC) No 3482/88  (1), (EEC) No 839/88  (2) and (EEC) No 1673/89   (3), the customs duties applicable on import into the Community, excluding Spain, of certain  prepared or preserved fish other than tuna, coming from Portugal, are suspended; whereas therefore  it is appropriate to open, for 1991, only the Community tariff quota laid down for the said tuna,  prepared or preserved;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and  the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in  question into all the Member States until the quota is exhausted; whereas it is appropriate to take  the necessary measures to ensure effective Community administration of this tariff quota while  offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota volume the necessary quantities  corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation  between the Member States and the Commission;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes clopyralid, cyprodinil, fosetyl and trinexapac.
(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For clopyralid the rapporteur Member State was Finland and all relevant information was submitted on 2 December 2003. For cyprodinil and fosetyl the rapporteur Member State was France and all relevant information was submitted on 16 January 2004 and 20 October 2003 respectively. For trinexapac the rapporteur Member State was The Netherlands and all relevant information was submitted on 7 November 2003.
(3) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 14 December 2005 in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports for clopyralid, cyprodinil, fosetyl and trinexapac (4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 4 April 2006 in the format of the Commission review reports for clopyralid, cyprodinil, fosetyl and trinexapac.
(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing clopyralid, cyprodinil, fosetyl and trinexapac may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1) (a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points concerning clopyralid, cyprodinil and fosetyl. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore it is appropriate to require that clopyralid, cyprodinil and fosetyl should be subjected to further testing for confirmation of the risk assessment for some issues and that such studies should be presented by the notifiers.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing clopyralid, cyprodinil, fosetyl and trinexapac to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 of 24 February 1986 on the common organization of the market in products processed from fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 17 (2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81 (2) provides for an amount additional to the customs duty to be levied on imports of preserved cultivated mushrooms falling within subheading ex 20.02 A of the Common Customs Tariff in excess of a certain quantity;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 964/91 of 18 April 1991 concerning the classification of certain goods in the combined nomenclature (2), classified under CN code 2003 10 10 certain completely simmered cultivated mushrooms of the Agaricus species  which have undergone treatment to preserve them better during transport and storage prior to processing and which are generally used as a raw material by the preserves industry; whereas these products must therefore be subject to the import arrangements  provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81;
Whereas for some time there has been a marked increase in imports of cultivated mushrooms which have been preserved, provisionally falling within CN code 0711 90 40, and they are now far in excess of the quantities traditionally placed in free  circulation in the Community; whereas these products are used in the Community to manufacture preserved mushrooms; whereas in these circumstances Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81 should be applied to mushrooms which have been preserved provisionally, so as  to ensure that the measures adopted for preserved mushrooms continue to be effective;
Whereas, however, so that trade between the Community and the countries which export these mushrooms can continue, the quantity provided for in the present legislation should be adjusted to the new situation;
Whereas in order to take account of existing trade flows it appears advisable to take as a basis for adjusting the quantity which is not subject to the levying of an additional amount the traditional pattern of trade in the mushrooms in question;  whereas 1990 and 1991 should be the reference years for this purpose;
Whereas the Interim Agreement between the European Economic Community and Poland provides for the quantity allocated to that country under the import arrangements provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81 to be increased each year during the first  five years for which it applies; whereas the overall quantity must take account of this increase as from 1992;
Whereas, given the features of supply from third countries on the Community market, the latter may be managed by fixing the additional amount so as to take account of the difference in production costs in the Community and the third countries concerned  since the prices of the products in question fluctuate substantially and there is a need to discourage imports in excess of the quantity exempt from the additional amount;
Whereas the arrangements in question now concern two different presentations of mushrooms; whereas account should be taken of this situation when the additional amount is fixed and a different amount should be fixed for the two presentations concerned  in line with the criteria set out above; whereas that amount should also be expressed in terms of a common unit of weight for the two presentations of mushrooms;
Whereas, in the interest of clarity, provisions which refer to Regulations which have since been repealed should be amended,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1122/92 of 28 April 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1796/81 on measures applicable to imports of preserved cultivated mushrooms', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 1796/81 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. in the title the words 'preserved cultivated mushrooms' shall be replaced by 'mushrooms of the species Agaricus spp. falling within CN codes 0711 90 40, 2003 10 20 and 2003 10 30'.\n\n2.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products (1), and in particular Article 31(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Parabens are regulated as preservatives in entry 12 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 on cosmetic products under the denomination 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and its salts and esters, with a maximum concentration of 0,4 % for single ester and 0,8 % for mixtures of esters.
(2) The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS), established pursuant to Commission Decision 2008/721/EC (2), adopted an opinion on parabens in December 2010 (3). This opinion was followed by a clarification of October 2011 (4) in response to a unilateral decision by Denmark to ban propylparaben and butylparaben, their isoforms and their salts in cosmetic products for children under three years of age based on those substances' potential endocrine activity, taken in accordance with Article 12 of Council Directive 76/768/EEC (5). The conclusions of 2010 and 2011 were confirmed by the SCCS in an additional opinion of May 2013 (6), which the Commission had requested in light of a new study on the reprotoxicity of propylparaben.
(3) In the above-mentioned opinions, which concerned all the long-chain parabens, the SCCS confirmed that methylparaben and ethylparaben are safe at the maximum authorized concentrations.
(4) Isopropylparaben, isobutylparaben, phenylparaben, benzylparaben and pentylparaben were banned by Commission Regulation (EU) No 358/2014 (7).
(5) The SCCS concluded that the use of butylparaben and propylparaben as preservatives in finished cosmetic products is safe to the consumer, as long as the sum of their individual concentrations does not exceed 0,19 % (as esters).
(6) For general cosmetic products containing butylparaben and propylparaben, excluding specific products for the nappy area, the SCCS concluded that there was no safety concern for children of any age group as the margin of safety was based on very conservative assumptions, with regards to both toxicity and exposure.
(7) However, the SCCS maintained that concerning butylparaben and propylparaben present in leave-on cosmetic products designed for application on the nappy area of children below the age of six months, a risk could not be excluded in the light of both immature metabolism of such children and the possibility of damaged skin in the nappy area. Based on a worst case assumption of exposure, safety concerns might be raised.
(8) No concerns were raised on the safety of 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid and its salts (calcium paraben, sodium paraben, potassium paraben).
(9) The Commission considers that the continued use of butylparaben and propylparaben under the current conditions may constitute a potential risk for human health. It therefore considers that the conditions for their use should be aligned with the recommendations of the SCCS.
(10) For reasons of consistency with the current entry 12 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, the recommended maximum concentration of 0,19 % as esters for the substances listed in entry 12a should be converted to be expressed into its equivalent as acid, 0,14 %. In addition, the sodium and potassium salts of butyl and propylparabens should be submitted to the same conditions of use as butyl and propylparabens themselves, given that the SCCS never reported a different behaviour (in the chemistry or toxicity) of the salts compared to the esters in any of its previous opinions.
(11) In the absence of any indication to the contrary from the SCCS, the maximum concentration of 0,8 % for the sum of all parabens contained in a cosmetic product already foreseen by entry 12 of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should be maintained.
(12) In light of the concerns raised by the SCCS regarding the use of parabens in leave-on cosmetic products designed for application on the nappy area of children under the age of six months, and for practical reasons linked to the fact that products for infants are usually marketed for children under three years, butylparaben and propylparaben should be prohibited in leave-on cosmetic products designed for application on the nappy area of children below three years.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) The application of the above-mentioned restrictions should be deferred to allow the industry to make the necessary adjustments to product formulations. In particular, undertakings should be granted six months to place on the market compliant products, and twelve months to withdraw from the market non-compliant products after the entry into force of this Regulation.

Whereas on 30 April 1987 the French Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for aquaculture and the provision of protected marine areas, hereinafter referred to as 'the programme'; whereas on 18 August 1987 it forwarded the latest additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas the aim of the programme is substantial development of aquaculture in France, mainly in sea water but also in fresh water; whereas, in addition to the expansion of traditional shellfish farming, provision is also made for diversification to many new species, particularly in sea water; whereas investments of approximately 230 million ECU are estimated to be necessary for the completion of the programme;
Whereas, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the programme meets the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the draft Regulation submitted by the Commission,
Whereas the production of sweet clear-fleshed cherries, marinated in alcohol and intended for the manufacture of chocolate products, is currently insufficient in the Community to meet the requirements of the user industries in the Community; whereas, consequently, Community supplies of products of this type depend to a considerable extent on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to partially suspend the Common Customs Tariff duty for the products in question, within a Community tariff quota of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to bring into question the development prospects of this production in the Community while ensuring an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to limit the benefits of tariff quotas solely to products which meet certain criteria as to presentation and use, to open the quota for the period 1 July to 31 December 1985 and to fix the volume of this quota at a level of 1 500 tonnes, corresponding to the needs for imports from third countries during that period, and to fix the quota duty at 10 %;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of duty for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, arrangements for the utilization of the tariff quota based on an allocation among Member States would seem to be consistent with the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to correspond as closely as possible to the actual trend in the market on the product in question, allocation of the quota should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States as calculated by reference to statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, however, since the quota is an autonomous Community tariff quota intended to cover import needs arising in the Community, the quota volume may be allocated on the basis of the estimated temporary import needs from third countries of each of the Member States; whereas these arrangements for allocation will also ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, to take account of possible import trends for the product concerned, the quota volume should be divided into two tranches, the first being allocated between certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to meet subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares; whereas, to give importers of the Member States some degree of certainty, the first tranche of the tariff quota should be fixed at a relatively high level, which in this case could be 1 330 tonnes;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, any Member State which has almost entirely used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas, each time its additional share is almost entirely used up, a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, which latter must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quota has been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly; Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1248/85 of 13 May 1985 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for sweet clear-fleshed cherries, marinated in alcohol and intended for the manufacture of chocolate products, falling within subheading ex 20.06 B I e) 2 bb) of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 (Ronozyme) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 14223), as a feed additive for ducks, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of the preparation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 14223) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, piglets, pigs for fattening and sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 255/2005 (2) and provisionally authorised for salmonids by Commission Regulation (EC) No 521/2005 (3).
(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2007 that the preparation of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 (Ronozyme) produced by Aspergillus oryzae (DSM 14223) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (4). It further concluded that the preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation for this additional animal category. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is efficacious in digestibility of feedingstuffs. Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '19.12.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 333/54', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1500/2007\nof 18 December 2007\nof concerning the authorisation of a new use of 6-phytase EC 3.1.3.26 (Ronozyme) as a feed additive\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), as last amended by Decision 94/370/EC (2), and in particular Article 24 thereof,
Whereas Decision 90/424/EEC provides for the possibility of financial participation by the Community in the eradication and surveillance of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia;
Whereas by letter, Portugal has submitted a programme for the eradication of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia;
Whereas after examination of the programme it was found to comply with all Community criteria relating to the eradication of the disease in conformity with Council Decision 90/638/EEC of 27 November 1990 laying down Community criteria for the eradication and monitoring of certain animal diseases (3), as amended by Directive 92/65/EEC (4);
Whereas this programme appears on the priority list of programmes for the eradication and surveillance of animal diseases which can benefit from financial participation from the Community in 1998 and which was established by Commission Decision 97/681/EC (5);
Whereas in the light of the importance of the programme for the achievement of Community objectives in the field of animal health, it is appropriate to fix the financial participation of the Community at 50 % of the costs incurred by Portugal up to a maximum of ECU 1 400 000;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
After consulting the Fund (EAGGF) committee,
Whereas, for intervention operations for which a unit amount has not been set by market organization rules, the basic rules applicable to Community financing are those of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 (2), in particular as concerns the method of establishing the amounts to be financed, the financing of expenditure resulting from the mobilization of the funds needed for intervention buying, the valuation of stocks to be carried over from one year to another and the financing of expenditure resulting from the physical operations of storage;
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 provides that the interest charges incurred by Member States in mobilizing the funds used for public intervention buying are to be financed by the Community at a uniform interest rate;
Whereas it may appear in a Member State that the buying into public intervention of agricultural products can be financed only at interest rates which are substantially higher than the uniform interest rate;
Whereas provision should be made, in such cases, for a correcting mechanism to compensate for a part of the difference between the particularly high interest rate paid by the Member State and the uniform interest rate, while leaving responsibility for a part of the difference to the Member State in order to encourage it to seek the least costly financing method;
Whereas the mechanism introduced to that end in Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1571/93 (3) for a period of three years is functioning satisfactorily, but whereas that provision expired at the end of the 1995 financial year;

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included napropamide. By Commission Decision 2008/902/EC (4) it was decided not to include napropamide in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the original notifier, hereinafter ‘the applicant’, submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(3) The application was submitted to Denmark, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance has been clarified. The supported uses are the same as those that were the subject of Decision 2008/902/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(4) Denmark evaluated the new information and data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 30 June 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on napropamide to the Commission on 26 March 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 October 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for napropamide.
(5) The additional report by the rapporteur Member State and the new conclusion by the Authority concentrate on the concerns that lead to the non-inclusion. Those concerns were in particular the potential contamination of groundwater by the metabolite 2-(1-naphthyloxy)propionic acid, hereinafter ‘NOPA’, and the risk to mammals, fish-eating birds and aquatic organisms. The new data submitted by the applicant show the following. The metabolite NOPA is neither of toxicological nor of biological relevance. Moreover, the risk to birds and mammals may be considered low, while for the risk for aquatic organisms acceptable uses were identified, on the basis of the additional data provided.
(6) Consequently, the additional data and information provided by the applicant permit to eliminate the specific concerns that led to the non-inclusion. No other open scientific questions have arisen.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing napropamide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include napropamide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(8) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that the inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submits information on the aquatic risk for the photolysis metabolites and for NOPA, and information for the risk assessment of aquatic plants.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

That list included napropamide. By Commission Decision 2008/902/EC(4)it was decided not to include napropamide in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the original notifier, hereinafter ‘the applicant’, submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I(5).\n\n((3)) The application was submitted to Denmark, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance has been clarified. The supported uses are the same as those that were the subject of Decision 2008/902/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n\n((4)) Denmark evaluated the new information and data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 30 June 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on napropamide to the Commission on 26 March 2010(6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 October 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for napropamide.\n\n((5)) The additional report by the rapporteur Member State and the new conclusion by the Authority concentrate on the concerns that lead to the non-inclusion. Those concerns were in particular the potential contamination of groundwater by the metabolite 2-(1-naphthyloxy)propionic acid, hereinafter ‘NOPA’, and the risk to mammals, fish-eating birds and aquatic organisms. The new data submitted by the applicant show the following. The metabolite NOPA is neither of toxicological nor of biological relevance. Moreover, the risk to birds and mammals may be considered low, while for the risk for aquatic organisms acceptable uses were identified, on the basis of the additional data provided.\n\n((6)) Consequently, the additional data and information provided by the applicant permit to eliminate the specific concerns that led to the non-inclusion. No other open scientific questions have arisen.\n\n((7)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing napropamide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include napropamide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n\n((8)) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that the inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submits information on the aquatic risk for the photolysis metabolites and for NOPA, and information for the risk assessment of aquatic plants.\n\n((9)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nMember States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 30 June 2011 at the latest.

opening an autonomous quota for imports of high-quality beef
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In view of the Community's interest in developing harmonious trade relations with third countries, provision should be made for opening, as an autonomous measure, a Community import tariff quota of 1000 tonnes of high-quality fresh, chilled or frozen beef.
(2) In spite of the difficulties experienced in 2001, the beef market is now on the way to becoming more stable. Demand of consumers in the Community is increasing, especially for high-quality beef. An additional reduced-tariff-quota for high-quality beef would satisfy at the same time the consumer interests as well as supplier interests. It would not have a significant impact on the total volume of beef imports into the Community.
(3) All operators concerned in the Community should be offered equal and continuous access to that quota. It is also necessary to insure appropriate monitoring. To this end, the utilisation of the quota should be based on the presentation of a certificate of authenticity guaranteeing the type and origin of the products.
(4) Under Article 32 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), tariff quotas for the products covered by this Regulation are to be administered by the Commission in accordance with detailed rules adopted under the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the said Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1149/2002 of 27 June 2002 opening an autonomous quota for imports of high-quality beef', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2003/298/EC of 14 April 2003 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(1), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Decision 2003/298/EC, which is applicable from 1 May 2003, the Community has undertaken to establish for each marketing year import tariff quotas at a reduced or zero rate of duty for 16875 tonnes of wheat and meslin flour (order number 09.4618) and 45250 tonnes of malt (order number 09.4619) originating in the Czech Republic.
(2) Those import quotas should be managed according to the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 925/2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Decision 2003/298/EC as regards the concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas on certain cereal products originating in the Czech Republic and amending Regulation (EC) No 2809/2000(2), until 30 June 2003.
(3) In the interest of simplification the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(4), should be applied to those quotas as from 1 July 2003, which is the starting date of the new marketing year.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (1), and in particular Article 17(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 health claims made on foods are prohibited unless they are authorised by the Commission in accordance with that Regulation and included in a list of permitted claims.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 also provides that applications for authorisations of health claims may be submitted by food business operators to the national competent authority of a Member State. The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as ‘the Authority’.
(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission thereof, and to deliver an opinion on the health claim concerned.
(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.
(5) Following an application from Cargill Incorporated, submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and requesting the protection of proprietary data for one meta-analysis (2) and for information pertaining to the production process of barley ‘betafiber’ (BarlivTM), the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of barley beta-glucans on lowering of blood cholesterol and reduced risk of (coronary) heart disease (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00798) (3). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: ‘Barley beta-glucan has been shown to lower/reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of (coronary) heart disease’.
(6) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 8 December 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of barley beta-glucans and lowering of blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims. The meta-analysis and information pertaining to the production process of barley ‘betafiber’ (BarlivTM), claimed by the applicant as proprietary, were not considered necessary by the Authority for reaching its conclusion. It is therefore considered that the requirement laid down in point (c) of Article 21(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is not fulfilled and accordingly, protection of proprietary data should not be granted.
(7) Following an application from Valens Int. d.o.o., submitted pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of barley beta-glucans on lowering of blood cholesterol and reduced risk of (coronary) heart disease (Question No EFSA-Q-2011-00799) (4). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded as follows: ‘Barley beta-glucan has been shown to reduce blood cholesterol. Blood cholesterol lowering may reduce the risk of heart disease’.
(8) On the basis of the data presented, the Authority concluded in its opinion received by the Commission and the Member States on 8 December 2011 that a cause and effect relationship had been established between the consumption of barley beta-glucans and lowering of blood LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Accordingly, a health claim reflecting this conclusion should be considered as complying with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, and should be included in the Union list of permitted claims.
(9) Article 16(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides that an opinion in favour of authorising a health claim should include certain particulars. Accordingly, those particulars should be set out in the Annex to this Regulation as regards the authorised claim and include, as the case may be, the revised wording of the claim, specific conditions of use of the claim, and, where applicable, conditions or restrictions of use of the food and/or an additional statement or warning, in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in line with the opinions of the Authority.
(10) One of the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 is to ensure that health claims are truthful, clear and reliable and useful to the consumer, and that wording and presentation are taken into account in that respect. Therefore where the wording of claims has the same meaning for consumers as that of an authorised health claim, because they demonstrate the same relationship that exists between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and health, they should be subject to the same conditions of use indicated in the Annex to this Regulation.
(11) The comments from the applicants and the members of the public received by the Commission pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '9.11.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 310/38', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1048/2012\nof 8 November 2012\non the authorisation of a health claim made on foods and referring to the reduction of disease risk\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 health claims made on foods are prohibited unless they are authorised by the Commission in accordance with that Regulation and included in a list of permitted claims.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 also provides that applications for authorisations of health claims may be submitted by food business operators to the national competent authority of a Member State.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, originating, inter alia, in the People’s Republic of China.
(2) The request was lodged on 23 June 2005 by the Defence Committee of the Steel Butt-Welding Fittings Industry of the European Union on behalf of four Community producers.
B.   PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, normally declared under CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90 originating in the People’s Republic of China (the product concerned). These codes are given for information only.
(4) The product under investigation is tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, consigned from the Philippines (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned.
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 (2) as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2212/2003 (3).
D.   GROUNDS
(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of the transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin via the Philippines of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel.
(7) The evidence submitted is as follows.
The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, originating in the People’s Republic of China via the Philippines.
Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of quantities. Significant volumes of imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, from the Philippines appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China.
Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.
Should circumvention practices via the Philippines covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation other than transhipment and incorrect declaration of origin be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
E.   PROCEDURE
(8) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, consigned from the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(a)   Questionnaires
(9) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the Philippines, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(10) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation, - in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire - within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(11) The authorities of the People’s Republic of China and the Philippines will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Exemption of registration of imports or measures
(13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(14) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers of the product concerned that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.
F.   REGISTRATION
(15) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from the Philippines.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(16) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— producers in the Philippines may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
(17) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated,","{'header': '5.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 204/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1288/2005\nof 4 August 2005\ninitiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 964/2003 on imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel originating,inter alia, in the People’s Republic of China by imports of certain tube or pipe fittings, of iron or steel, consigned from the Philippines, whether declared as originating in the Philippines or not, and making such imports subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAn investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, in order to determine if imports into the Community of tube or pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex\xa07307\xa093\xa011 (TARIC code 7307931195), ex\xa07307\xa093\xa019 (TARIC code 7307931995), ex\xa07307\xa099\xa030 (TARIC code 7307993095) and ex\xa07307\xa099\xa090 (TARIC code 7307999095), consigned from the Philippines, whether originating in the Philippines or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 964/2003.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.\nRegistration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\nThe Commission, by Regulation, may direct customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the Community of products manufactured by producers having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the anti-dumping duties.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Questionnaires should be requested from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Interested parties, if their representations are to be taken into account during the investigation, must make themselves known by contacting the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information within 40 days from the date of the publication of this Regulation in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n, unless otherwise specified.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Producers in the Philippines requesting exemption from registration of imports or measures should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the same 40-day time limit.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Interested parties may also apply to be heard by the Commission within the same 40-day time limit.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Any information relating to the matter, any request for a hearing or for a questionnaire as well as any request for exemption must be made in writing (not in electronic format, unless otherwise specified) and must indicate the name, address, e-mail address, telephone, fax and/or telex numbers of the interested party.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 105(4) thereof and Article 4 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank annexed thereto,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Monetary Institute (3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 106(6) of the Treaty and in Article 42 of the said Protocol,
(1) Whereas the European Central Bank (ECB) will be established as soon as its Executive Board is appointed;
(2) Whereas the Treaty stipulates that national authorities shall consult the ECB regarding any draft legislative provision in its fields of competence; whereas it is for the Council to set out the limits and the conditions of such consultation;
(3) Whereas this obligation on the authorities of the Member States to consult the ECB must not prejudice the responsibility of these authorities for the matters which are the subject of such provision; whereas Member States must consult the ECB on any draft legislation in its fields of competence in accordance with Article 105(4) of the Treaty; whereas the list of particular areas included in Article 2 of this Decision is not exhaustive; whereas the sixth indent of Article 2 of this Decision is without prejudice to the present assignment of competences for policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system;
(4) Whereas the monetary functions and operations of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) are defined in the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB; whereas central banks of participating Member States are an integral part of the ESCB and must act in accordance with the guidelines and instructions of the ECB; whereas, in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the authorities of non-participating Member States must consult the ECB on draft legislative provisions on the instruments of monetary policy;
(5) Whereas as long as Member States do not participate in the monetary policy of the ESCB, this Decision does not concern decisions taken by authorities of these Member States in the context of the implementation of their monetary policy;
(6) Whereas consultation of the ECB must not unduly lengthen procedures for adopting legislative provisions in the Member States; whereas the time limits within which the ECB must deliver its opinion must, nevertheless, enable it to examine the texts referred to it with the required care; whereas, in duly justified cases of extreme urgency, for which the reasons will be stated, for example on account of market sensitivity, Member States may set a time limit which is less than one month and which reflects the urgency of the situation; whereas in these cases particularly, dialogue between the national authorities and the ECB should enable the interests of both to be taken into account;
(7) Whereas, in accordance with paragraphs 5 and 8 of Protocol No 11 annexed to the Treaty, this Decision shall not apply to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland if and so long as that Member State does not move to the third stage of EMU;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1068/97 (2), and in particular Article 7(5)(b) thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 France, has sent the Commission an application for registration of a name as a geographical indication;
Whereas it has been found, in accordance with Article 6(1) of the above Regulation, that the application meets all the Regulation's requirements, in particular that all the information required under Article 4 has been provided;
Whereas several declarations of opposition within the meaning of Article 7 of the above Regulation were sent to the Commission following publication of the name in the Annex to this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) but that only one of these declarations was considered justified and accordingly admissible; whereas the declarations of opposition deemed inadmissible either failed to show the grounds on which the opposition was based or did not relate to the comprehensive grounds for opposition laid down in paragraph 4 of that Article;
Whereas in accordance with Article 7(5) of that Regulation and in view of the fact that French producers submitted a declaration of opposition, the Commission invited the Member State concerned to seek agreement; whereas, however, no agreement was reached and the Commission must accordingly decide on registration of the name in question;
Whereas, with regard to a declaration of opposition from Danish producers, the Commission had to reconsider its position because of factors which had not come to light at the time the opposition was sent to the Commission; whereas that opposition should also be declared admissible;
Whereas, under Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, as added by Council Regulation (EEC) No 535/97 (4), provision may be made for a transitional period of up to five years under Article 7(5)(b), where inter alia products exist (as in this case) which have been legally on the market for at least five years preceding the date of the publication provided for in Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92; whereas such transitional period may be provided for only where undertakings have legally marketed the products concerned using the names in question continuously for at least five years preceding the date of publication provided for in Article 6(2) of that Regulation; whereas the Member States in question state that these conditions have been fulfilled;
Whereas in view of the arguments put forward by the parties concerned, a transitional period of three years is appropriate; whereas this transitional period applies to the companies 'Salaisons du Pays d'Oc`, 'Sør-Wi A/S`, 'Sørwi A/S`, 'Suhls Pålæg A/S`, 'Steff-Houlberg`, 'Vestjyske Slagterier A.m.b.a.` and 'Danish Crown`; whereas those companies fulfil the conditions laid down in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92;
Whereas, as a result, this name should be entered in the 'Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications` and should therefore enjoy Community protection as a geographic indication;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organizations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3744/87 of 14 December 1987 laying down the detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organizations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,

Whereas in order to implement the scheme for the supply of such food to that section of the population, to be financed from resources available in the 1988 budget year, it is necessary to allocate the resources between the Member States; whereas in order to facilitate the implementation of this scheme it is necessary to specify the rate of exchange to be employed in converting ECU into the national currency and to do so at a rate which reflects economic reality;
Whereas statistical data upon which the numbers of the most deprived persons in each Member State may be estimated is now available;
Whereas on 18 January 1988, Spain requested Commission authorization to initiate the action on its territory and indicated the quantites of produce that it wished to distribute; whereas it is desirable to authorize this action and, subject to any further allocation pursuant to the provisions of Article 4 (2) of Regulation 3744/87, to make a definitive allocation of resources for its implementation;
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3744/87, the Commission has sought the advice of major organizations familiar with the problems of the most deprived persons in the Community when drawing up this Decision,","{'title': '88/144/EEC: Commission Decision of 1 March 1988 allocating to Spain resources to be charged to the 1988 budget year for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organizations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) The general objective of the European Return Fund is to support the efforts made by the Member States to improve the management of return in all its dimensions taking into account Union legislation in this field and in full compliance with fundamental rights.
(2) In accordance with the specific objectives indicated in Article 3(1)(c) of Decision No 575/2007/EC, the Return Fund shall contribute to ‘the promotion of an effective and uniform application of common standards on return in line with policy developments in this field’.
(3) In that context, the Return Fund provides support to Member States for the implementation of Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (2) (the Return Directive) by co-financing a wide range of measures.
(4) In order to ensure the effective implementation of the Return Directive by Member States, it is appropriate to further reinforce the support of the Fund by extending the scope of eligible measures, in particular, to address the needs relating to Article 16 of the Return Directive requiring that detention take place as a rule in specialised detention facilities. Moreover, in the light of the experience gained since the launch of the European Return Fund and in order to reinforce the capacities of Member States to ensure effective transportation of returnees during return procedures and return operations, it is appropriate to give the possibilities under the Fund to finance necessary means of transport, such as buses.
(5) Considering that the 2011 and 2012 annual programmes of the Member States under the European Return Fund are still ongoing, it is appropriate that the modified rules apply from the 2011 annual programme onwards.
(6) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom is bound by the basic act and, as a consequence, by this Decision.
(7) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland is bound by the basic act and, as a consequence, by this Decision.
(8) In accordance with Article 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not bound by this Decision or subject to the application thereof.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the common Committee ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ established by Decision No 574/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 836/2004 of 28 April 2004 laying down the transitional measures to be applied by Cyprus with regard to scrapie (2) was adopted in view of the exceptional high level of scrapie in the ovine and caprine populations in Cyprus. It lays down certain transitional measures, including a prohibition on the dispatch from Cyprus to other Member States and third countries of certain meat and meat products derived from ovine and caprine animals. That Regulation applies until 30 April 2007.
(2) The results of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) eradication and monitoring programme for 2006 in the Community indicate that in Cyprus, 865 cases of TSE in sheep were diagnosed, out of the total of 2 579 TSE cases in the Community, and 461 TSE cases in goats were diagnosed, out of the total of 531 TSE cases in the Community.
(3) In the framework of the TSE roadmap (COM(2005) 322 final) adopted on 15 July 2005 and in line with the SANCO work programme 2006-2007 on TSEs (SEC(2006) 1527), the Commission is currently discussing with the Member States on a proposal to review the current measures to apply in TSE affected flocks where BSE has been excluded.
(4) Due to the animal health situation in Cyprus in sheep and goat populations with regard to scrapie, taking control requirements into account and awaiting the conclusions of the discussion on a review of the current eradication measures it is necessary to maintain certain protection measures as regards the intra-Community trade and trade with third countries with certain meat and meat products derived from ovine and caprine animals in order to prevent the risk of the disease in other Member States.
(5) The dispatch of products derived from ovine and caprine animals in Cyprus to other Member States and the export thereof to third countries should therefore continue to be prohibited.

Whereas cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have been reported in the United Kingdom;
Whereas in order to protect animal and public health in the Community, the Commission has adopted several Decisions, in particular Decision 94/474/EC of 27 July 1994 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and  repealing Decisions 89/469/EEC and 90/200/EEC (4);

Whereas the Commission has carried out a detailed examination of the situation and all relevant scientific information with the Scientific Veterinary Committee;
Whereas the prohibition on feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) of ruminant origin to ruminants in July 1988 was the principal measure in controlling BSE; whereas, however, this prohibiton has not been totally effective in preventing the occurrence of BSE  in bovines born after July 1988;
Whereas, however, in the opinion of the Scientific Veterinary Committee, the feed ban is becoming increasingly effective, and the evidence for natural and horizontal transmission is slight; whereas, therefore the risk of human exposure to the BSE agent  from meat from cattle born in the United Kingdom after 1 January 1992 is very low; whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has recommended that the BSE restrictions on this meat should be lifted;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3944/90 (2), and in particular Article 4  thereof,
Whereas, on 30 April 1991, the Government of Spain forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet for the period 1992 to 1996, hereinafter referred to as 'the programme', as required by Article 3 (3) of Regulation  (EEC) No 4028/86; whereas it forwarded at a later date additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the  programme fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decision 88/149/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 90/108/EEC (4) and by Decision 91/454/EEC (5) constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the  effort still needed to ensure that the Community objectives are achieved;
Whereas the current or likely situation as regards availability of fish in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned does not allow for any adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved;  whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1992 to 1996, in view of the fact that availability of fish continues to deteriorate;
Whereas the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme  period between fleet capacity and fish availability;
Whereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken under this programme may not warrant public financial  assistance; whereas, in this context, approval of the programme should only be effective where the limitations and conditions upon which such approval was made conditional are complied with;
Whereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is  most apparent; whereas there is insufficient information available at present to achieve comprehensive segmentation of the fleet in accordance with stocks and zones fished; whereas a broader range of parameters should therefore be developed to evaluate  fishing effort as well as fleet capacity;
Whereas the Commission cannot approve programmes for the full period until adequate information is available to Member States to permit this new approach and additional time will be required to execute the work programme necessary to complete this  process;
Whereas it is not appropriate to interrupt the process of reduction of the fleet inherent in the guidance programmes; whereas transitional programmes, for the period 1 January to 31 December 1992, should therefore be approved;
Whereas further reduction in fleet capacity is needed in view of the present state of the fish stocks; whereas available information indicates that a minimum reduction of 2 % expressed in tonnage and engine power, based on the objectives for the end of  1991, is necessary to compensate for technological progress; whereas in addition to that reduction, a certain percentage reduction is also necessary for catching-up, in the case of those Member States which have not reached the 1991 objectives;

OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 592 662 GRT and 1 720 881 kW, in accordance with point II.2;\n\n(b) to restructure all categories of vessel in the fishing fleet by the renewal of some 3 % of vessels measuring between five and nine or 12 metres in length between perpendiculars and by the renewal of approximately 4 % of the vessels measuring over  nine or 12 metres in length between perpendiculars;\n\n(c) to stabilize the tuna freezer fleet at 67 918 GRT and 138 133 kW, on the understanding that, if the fished capacity of the tuna purse seiners is expanded beyond the objectives and limits laid down in the programme for this category, this shall not  affect the achievement of the overall objectives of the programme and provided that such expansion does not call for any Community financial assistance towards the utilization of the fishing capacities concerned. Such expansion may not affect the  reference data to be taken into consideration by the Community for the purposes of establishing and conduction reactions with third countries;\n\n(d) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong.\n\n2.

PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at point II.2, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992, account must also be  taken of changes in fishing capacity resulting from:\n\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission (¹),\n\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1992, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\n\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, the implementation of which is conditional on the fishing capacities used remaining within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction  achieved by each measure may be varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in point III.1.1 is reduced as planned:\n\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with new vessels, in line with the guidelines and objectives laid down at  point II.2,\n\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reduction which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n\n- the adoption of administrative measures to forestall any potential increases in fishing capacity which would be contrary to the aims of the programme,\n\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n\n(¹) Overall capacity may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n\n2. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the programmes's objectives.\n\n3. Improvement of the register of fishing vessels, with a view to effective control of fishing capacity.\n\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objective for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 12. 1991 which were  achieved by Member States (¹) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while  the remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n\n3. The numbers of fishing vessels operating in Community waters and appearing on the basic list as defined in Article 158 of the Act of Accession must remain within the limits set by the said Act, and in particular Article 159 thereof.\n\n4. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n\n(¹) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 91.""}]}"

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas, baquiloprim, tylosin and tolfenamic acid should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth subgallate, bismuth subnitrate, bismuth subsalicylate, cloprostenol, r-cloprostenol and luprostiol should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, apramycin should be inserted into Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 of 21 December 1987 fixing conditions for the application of preferential customs duties on imports of certain flowers originating in Cyprus, Israel, Jordan and Morocco and the West Bank and the Gaza Strip(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1300/97(2), and in particular Article 5(2)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EEC) No 4088/87 fixes conditions for the application of a preferential customs duty on large-flowered roses, small-flowered roses, uniflorous (bloom) carnations and multiflorous (spray) carnations within the limit of tariff quotas opened annually for imports of fresh cut flowers into the Community.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001(3) opens and provides for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain products originating in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Malta, Morocco, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, Tunisia and Turkey, and provides detailed rules for extending and adapting these tariff quotas.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 741/2002(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 757/2002(5), fixed Community producer and import prices for carnations and roses for application of the arrangements for importation from the countries in question.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 of 29 November 2005 on the tariff rates for bananas (1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure that imports of bananas into the Community are adequately monitored, Article 1(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 (2) provides that bananas may be released into free circulation at the common customs tariff rate of duty established by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 subject to presentation of an import licence. Article 1(5) of that Regulation fixes the period of validity of such import licences at three months.
(2) In order to quickly obtain information on the quantities released for free circulation in the Community, the period of validity of licences should be shortened. To ensure the relevant information relates to the calendar year, the period of validity of licences should not extend beyond 31 December.
(3) For the same reasons, and notwithstanding Article 35(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3), the period during which operators must supply proof to the competent authority that the licences have been used should be shortened.
(4) In order to have data on the entire period of implementation of the tariff-only arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005, the reduction in the period for submission of proof of use of licences should also apply to licences valid from 1 January 2006, the date from which Regulation (EC) No 2014/2005 applies.
(5) Indication of the origin of bananas released into free circulation in the Community is particularly important information for the purposes of monitoring imports under the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005. To make this information available, provision should be made for import licences to be issued for imports of bananas from a specified origin. To that end, a distinction should be made between bananas originating in ACP countries and those originating in other third countries.
(6) To ensure that the market is adequately monitored, it is necessary to define the information on prices and quantities marketed which the Member States must forward to the Commission.
(7) In order to detect and prevent false declarations by operators, Member States should notify to the Commission the list of operators operating under Commission Regulations (EC) No 219/2006 (4) and (EC) No 2015/2005 of 9 December 2005 on imports during January and February 2006 of bananas originating in ACP countries under the tariff quota opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 1964/2005 on the tariff rates for bananas (5).
(8) Regulation (EC) No 219/2006 repeals Commission Regulation (EC) No 896/2001 (6), except for Articles 21, 26 and 27 and the Annex thereto, which it provides are to continue to apply to imports carried out under Regulation (EC) No 219/2006. In the interests of clarity and legal certainty, the content of those provisions should be incorporated into Regulation (EC) No 219/2006.
(9) Regulations (EC) No 2014/2005 and (EC) No 219/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 61, first paragraph, point (d), in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed by the Commission respecting the commitments resulting from international agreements concluded by the Union.
(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences, are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.
(3) For marketing year 2009/2010, Commission Regulation (EC) No 274/2009 (3) has fixed the quantitative limit for the exports of out-of-quota sugar at 1 350 000 tonnes. Applications for export licences quickly exceeded that limit. Therefore Commission Regulation (EC) No 1106/2009 (4) has fixed an acceptance percentage for the issuing of export licences and suspended the lodging of export-licence applications for out-of-quota sugar. At the time the limit of 1 350 000 t was fixed, the economic conditions were such that it was not possible to exclude that exports of out-of-quota sugar could be considered as being subsidised because the average cost of production of sugar in the Union could have exceeded the selling price of out-of-quota sugar on the export market. Under such conditions it was therefore not possible to increase the quantities of out-of-quota sugar to be exported beyond the limits resulting from the abovementioned international commitments of the Union.
(4) Since the beginning of 2009, the global economic conditions have changed significantly in the sugar sector. In early January 2010, world market prices for white sugar more than doubled and reached approximately EUR 500 per tonne at the London commodity futures market. At the same time, the prices on the sugar market in the Union decreased in line with the institutional reference price.
(5) Under the current economic conditions the average production cost of sugar beet in the Union is below the selling price of the out-of-quota sugar beet. Furthermore, the selling price of the out-of-quota sugar on the world market is above the average cost of sugar production in the Union. Therefore, as long as these conditions are valid, the export of out-of-quota sugar cannot be considered as being subsidised. Consequently, exports above the export subsidy commitments of the Union could be made without violating the obligations arising from Union membership of the World Trade Organisation.
(6) According to the most recent information, it is certain that due to exceptionally favourable weather conditions in 2009, large quantities of out-of-quota sugar will be produced in the Union. This quantity is currently estimated at around 4 100 000 tonnes. Taking into account all the possible outlets for this sugar, in particular the demand of the chemical industry for industrial sugar, it is estimated that at least 500 000 t would be still available for exports.
(7) In view of the surplus foreseen in the Union during marketing year 2009/2010 and the exceptionally high world market prices caused by a very difficult supply situation at this time it is preferable to export the remaining surplus sugar in the Union instead of carrying it forward to the next marketing year. Fixing an additional quantitative limit in respect of marketing year 2009/2010 would allow sugar producers and beet growers in the Union to benefit from the current favourable export possibilities. An additional quantitative limit should therefore be fixed.
(8) It is now estimated that world market sugar prices may start decreasing as from the second half of 2010. To make sure that the additional exports of out-of-quota sugar do not interfere with subsidy commitments of the Union, it is appropriate to limit the application for export licences until 30 June 2010 and to reduce the validity of export licences to one month.
(9) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting EU products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particularly favourable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.

in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n\n((7)) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.\n\n((9)) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.\n\n((10)) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.\n\n((11)) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d), (f), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the natural state, shall be set out in the Annex hereto to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 April 2005.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nEXPORT REFUNDS ON SYRUPS AND CERTAIN OTHER SUGAR PRODUCTS EXPORTED WITHOUT FURTHER PROCESSING APPLICABLE FROM 1 APRIL 2005\n(\n1\n)\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nAmount of refund\n1702\xa040\xa010\xa09100\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n35,22\n(\n2\n)\n1702\xa060\xa010\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n35,22\n(\n2\n)\n1702\xa060\xa080\xa09100\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n66,92\n(\n3\n)\n1702\xa060\xa095\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,3522\n(\n4\n)\n1702\xa090\xa030\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n35,22\n(\n2\n)\n1702\xa090\xa060\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,3522\n(\n4\n)\n1702\xa090\xa071\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,3522\n(\n4\n)\n1702\xa090\xa099\xa09900\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,3522\n(\n4\n)\n(\n5\n)\n2106\xa090\xa030\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n35,22\n(\n2\n)\n2106\xa090\xa059\xa09000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,3522\n(\n4\n)\nNB\n: The product codes and the ‘A ’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n).\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\nS00\n:\nall destinations (third countries, other territories, victualling and destinations treated as exports from the Community) with the exception of Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, except for sugar incorporated into the products referred to in Article 1(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 (\nOJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29\n).\n(\n1\n)\nThe amounts set out in this Annex are not applicable with effect from 1 February 2005 pusrsuant to Council Decision 2005/45/EC of 22 December 2004 concerning the conclusion and the provisional application of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 as regards the provisions applicable to processed agricultural products (\nOJ L 23, 26.1.2005, p. 17\n).\n(\n2\n)\nApplicable only to products referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n(\n3\n)\nApplicable only to products referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n(\n4\n)\nThe basic amount is not applicable to syrups which are less than 85 % pure (Regulation (EC) No 2135/95).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), and in particular Article 18(1) and (7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 91/496/EEC provides, inter alia, that if a disease or any other phenomenon liable to present a serious threat to animal or human health occurs or spreads in the territory of a third country, or if any other serious animal health reason so warrants, the Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, is permitted to adopt measures without delay, including special conditions in respect of animals coming from all or part of the third country concerned.
(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (2) lays down, inter alia, the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals. It provides that consignments of ungulates are to be introduced into the Union only if they comply with certain requirements and they are accompanied by the appropriate veterinary certificate, drawn up in accordance with the relevant model set out in Part 2 of Annex I to that Regulation.
(3) The animal health requirements set out in the model veterinary certificates provide for guarantees regarding animal diseases which may endanger the Union animal health status. The fulfilment of such requirements is therefore essential in order to protect the Union from outbreaks of exotic diseases.
(4) A notification by the United States to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) (3) shows that Novel Swine Enteric Coronavirus Disease caused by emerging porcine alphacoronaviruses including porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus and a new Porcine deltacoronavirus has emerged in North America. Canada informed the Commission about positive results of tests for the presence of the both the alpha and the deltacoronavirus carried out in Canadian pig holdings.
(5) Porcine epidemic diarrhoea caused by the emerging alphacoronavirus and the new porcine deltacoronavirus may constitute a risk for the animal health status of the Union. It affects pigs and the clinical disease is more evident in piglets in which it has caused high percentages of mortalities.
(6) Therefore it is necessary to review the animal health requirements for the entry of consignments of porcine animals into the Union from the areas in which the disease caused by these viruses is present in order to provide the necessary guarantees at the holding of origin and avoid the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhoea caused by those viruses in the Union.
(7) Due to the need to protect animal health in the Union and the serious threat posed by the introduction into the Union of live pigs for breeding and/or production the Commission should adopt provisional safeguard measures for consignments of those animals from affected third countries listed in Annex I to this Regulation. Accordingly, consignments of those animals should be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance with the model set out in Annex II to this Regulation which provides for specific guarantees in regard of porcine epidemic diarrhoea caused by the emerging alphacoronavirus and the new porcine deltacoronavirus
(8) Due to the serious risk to animal health posed by those consignments, those provisional safeguard measures should enter into force on the day following that of the publication of this Regulation and apply for a period of 6 months.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '11.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 203/91', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 750/2014\nof 10 July 2014\non protection measures in relation to porcine epidemic diarrhoea as regards the animal health requirements for the introduction into the Union of porcine animals\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 91/496/EEC provides, inter alia, that if a disease or any other phenomenon liable to present a serious threat to animal or human health occurs or spreads in the territory of a third country, or if any other serious animal health reason so warrants, the Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, is permitted to adopt measures without delay, including special conditions in respect of animals coming from all or part of the third country concerned.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010(2)lays down, inter alia, the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals.

Accordingly, consignments of those animals should be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance with the model set out in Annex II to this Regulation which provides for specific guarantees in regard of porcine epidemic diarrhoea caused by the emerging alphacoronavirus and the new porcine deltacoronavirus\n\n((8)) Due to the serious risk to animal health posed by those consignments, those provisional safeguard measures should enter into force on the day following that of the publication of this Regulation and apply for a period of 6 months.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nBy way of derogation from point (b) of Article 3 and Parts 1and 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010, consignments of live pigs for breeding and production, covered by the model veterinary certificate ‘POR-X’ set out in that Annex, from third countries listed in Annex I to this Regulation, shall be accompanied by a veterinary certificate in accordance with the model set out in the Annex II to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply until 12 January 2015.'}]}"

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships, 2009 (hereinafter ‘the Convention’), was adopted on 15 May 2009 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), as a result of the deliberations of the International Conference on the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The Convention covers the design, construction, operation and preparation of ships so as to facilitate safe and environmentally sound recycling without compromising ship safety and operational efficiency. It also covers the operation of ship recycling facilities in a safe and environmentally sound manner, and the establishment of an appropriate enforcement mechanism for ship recycling.
(2) The Convention enters into force 24 months after the date of ratification by at least 15 States representing a combined merchant fleet of at least 40 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world's merchant shipping and whose combined maximum annual ship recycling volume during the preceding 10 years constitutes not less than three per cent of the gross tonnage of the combined merchant shipping of the same States.
(3) In its conclusions of 21 October 2009, the Council strongly encouraged the Member States to ratify the Convention as a matter of priority so as to facilitate its entry into force as early as possible and to generate a real and effective change on the ground.
(4) Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) aims, amongst other things, to minimise and, to the extent practicable, eliminate adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by ship recycling and to facilitate the ratification of the Convention. Articles 5(9), 7(2), 10(1), 10(2), 12(1) and 12(3) of that Regulation provide for the alignment of Union law with the Convention. Article 32(4) refers to the situation of Member States which have no ships flying their flag or registered under their flag or have closed their national ship registers. Those Member States may derogate from certain provisions of the Regulation as long as no ship is registered under their flag.
(5) The Union cannot accede to the Convention, as only States can be parties thereto.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular Article 16(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle et al. (the pine wood nematode (PWN)), from another Member State, it should be authorised to temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger.
(2) Portugal informed the other Member States and the Commission on 25 June 1999 that some samples of pine trees originating in its territory were identified as infested by PWN. The Commission has adopted Decisions 2000/58/EC (2) and 2001/218/EC (3) defining measures to be taken against PWN.
(3) On the basis of assessments by the Food and Veterinary Office, most recently in November 2004, additional information submitted by Portugal and official surveys carried out by the other Member States on wood, isolated bark and plants of Abies Mill., Cedrus Trew, Larix Mill., Picea A. Dietr., Pinus L., Pseudotsuga Carr. and Tsuga Carr., it appears that as a result of the application of an eradication programme in Portugal, the spread of PWN remains limited to the demarcated areas in Portugal. However, trees showing symptoms of infestation by PWN were still found during surveys of those areas.
(4) The implementation of the Portuguese mid-term eradication plan for PWN of February 2003, as amended in June 2003, was evaluated by the Standing Committee on Plant Health in its meetings of July 2004 and May 2005. During the latter meeting it was concluded that the aimed reduction of infection level in the demarcated zone had not been fully achieved so far.
(5) It is therefore necessary for Portugal to continue to take specific measures with respect to movements of wood, isolated bark and host plants within demarcated areas in Portugal and from such areas into other areas of Portugal and into the other Member States.
(6) It is also necessary that Portugal continues to take measures to control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradication. Therefore, an updated mid-term eradication plan to better control the spread of PWN with the aim of eradicating should be presented.
(7) The other Member States should continue to have the possibility to apply additional measures to protect their territories from PWN.
(8) The results of the specific measures and of the implementation of the mid-term plan should be assessed continuously, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by Portugal and the other Member States.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION
of 30 October 2014
on the equivalence of the regulatory framework of Australia for central counterparties to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories
(2014/755/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The procedure for recognition of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) established in third countries set out in Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 aims to allow CCPs established and authorised in third countries whose regulatory standards are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the Union. That recognition procedure and the equivalence decision provided for therein thus contribute to the achievement of the overarching aim of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 to reduce systemic risk by extending the use of safe and sound CCPs to clear over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts, including where those CCPs are established and authorised in a third country.
(2) In order for a third country legal regime to be considered equivalent to the legal regime of the Union in respect of CCPs, the substantial outcome of the applicable legal and supervisory arrangements should be equivalent to Union requirements in respect of the regulatory objectives they achieve. The purpose of this equivalence assessment is therefore to verify that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs established and authorised therein do not expose clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to a higher level of risk than the latter could be exposed to by CCPs authorised in the Union and, consequently, do not pose unacceptable levels of systemic risk in the Union.
(3) On 1 September 2013, the Commission received the technical advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) on the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia. The technical advice concludes that all of the provisions in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are replicated by corresponding legally binding requirements which are applicable, at a jurisdictional level, to CCPs authorised in Australia.
(4) In accordance with Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, three conditions need to be fulfilled in order to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country regarding CCPs authorised therein are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation.
(5) According to the first condition, CCPs authorised in a third country must comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(6) The legally binding requirements of Australia for CCPs authorised therein consist of the Corporations Act 2001 (‘Corporations Act’), which together with the Corporations Regulations 2001 (‘Corporations Regulations’), establish the legal framework for clearing and settlement facilities (‘CS facilities’). Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act provides that before granting a licence to carry out the activities of clearing or settlement, the Minister must be satisfied, among other things, that the CCP concerned has adequate operating rules and procedures which conform to the applicable laws and regulations to ensure, as far as it is reasonably practicable, that systemic risk is reduced and that the CCP is operated in a fair and effective manner. The CCP must also have adequate arrangements for handling conflicts of interest and for enforcing its internal rules and procedures. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (‘RBA’) advise the Minister regarding the granting of CS facilities' licences and changes of their internal rules and procedures, and are in charge of assessing, and in the case of ASIC of enforcing, CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act.
(7) ASIC provides regulatory guidance to regulated entities to explain specific issues already covered by legislation. In particular, ASIC revised its regulatory guidance on licensing and oversight of CS facilities' licences in December 2012 under the updated Regulatory Guide 211 ‘Clearing and settlement facilities: Australian and overseas operators’ (‘RG 211’). ASIC's RG 211 implements the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (‘PFMIs’) issued in April 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2) (‘CPSS’) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (‘IOSCO’), which are relevant for the obligations set out in the Corporations Act, and provides guidance to CCPs on how to comply with their obligations under the Corporations Act. Therefore, failure to comply with the Corporations Act as explained in RG 211 could entail enforcement action and sanctioning measures.
(8) RBA has the power, under the Corporations Act, to determine financial stability standards for the purpose of ensuring that CCPs operate in a way that causes or promotes the overall stability of the Australian financial system. In particular, in November 2012, RBA's Payments System Board approved the determination of new financial stability standards, the Financial Stability Standards for Central Counterparties (‘FSS’), which comprise 21 standards for CCPs, with accompanying sub-standards and guidance. Other than certain sub-standards, which came into effect on 31 March 2014, the FSS became effective in March 2013. The FSS are to be complied with by all licensed CCPs.
(9) The core principles for CS facilities set out in Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under ASIC's RG 211, and the FSS determined by RBA (together ‘the primary rules’), set out the high-level standards with which CCPs must comply in order to obtain authorisation to provide clearing services in Australia. Those primary rules comprise the first tier of the legally binding requirements in Australia. In order to comply with the primary rules, CCPs adopt, in addition, their internal rules and procedures which must conform with the specific requirements set out in the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under RG 211, and the FSS, which are submitted to the Minister prior to authorisation as a CS facility. Changes to the internal rules and procedures of CCPs must be notified to the Minister. The Minister can disallow changes in the internal rules and procedures of CCPs. The internal rules and procedures of CCPs have the effect of a contract and are legally binding on CCPs and their respective participants.
(10) The legally binding requirements set out in the primary rules applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia deliver substantial results equivalent to those of the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(11) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs authorised therein comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.
(12) According to the second condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein must provide for effective supervision and enforcement of those CCPs on an ongoing basis.
(13) CCPs authorised in Australia are subject to on-going supervision and oversight by ASIC and RBA. ASIC is responsible for enforcing CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act and in this respect, it conducts periodic assessments of compliance by CCPs with their licence obligations, other than their obligations relating to FSS and systemic risk reduction, and in particular with their duty to operate in a fair and effective manner to the extent it is reasonable to do so, and submits a report to the Minister, which is published. RBA monitors compliance by CCPs with their obligations under their respective licences and relating to financial stability and reduction of systemic risk, conducts periodic assessments of compliance by each CCP with the FSS and submits a report to the Minister, which is also published. CCPs authorised in Australia may receive written directions from the Minister and from ASIC. If a CCP fails to comply with a written direction, ASIC may apply to the courts which may order the CCP to comply with the written direction.
(14) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein provide for effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis.
(15) According to the third condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia must include an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CCPs authorised under third country legal regimes (‘third country CCPs’).
(16) Third country CCPs may apply for an ‘overseas clearing and settlement facility licence’ (‘an overseas CCP licence’) enabling them to provide in Australia some or all of the clearing services they are authorised to provide in their home country.
(17) The criteria applied to third country CCPs applying for an overseas CCP licence in Australia are comparable to those provided for third country CCPs applying for recognition under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. As a prerequisite for recognition, the regulatory regime of the third country in which the CCP is authorised must be deemed ‘sufficiently equivalent’, in relation to the degree of protection from systemic risk and level of effectiveness and fairness of services it achieves, to the Australian regulatory regime for comparable domestic CCPs. The assessment of ‘sufficient equivalence’ involves similar considerations as those assessed under Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The establishment of cooperation arrangements between the Australian authorities and the relevant foreign supervisory authorities is also required to grant an overseas CCP licence.
(18) It should therefore be considered that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia provide for an effective equivalent system for the recognition of third country CCPs.
(19) The conditions laid down in Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 can therefore be considered to be met by the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia regarding CCPs authorised therein and those legal and supervisory arrangements should be considered to be equivalent to the requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. The Commission, informed by ESMA, should continue monitoring the evolution of the Australian legal and supervisory framework for CCPs and the fulfilment of the conditions on the basis of which this decision has been taken.
(20) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,","{'header': '31.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 311/66', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 30 October 2014\non the equivalence of the regulatory framework of Australia for central counterparties to the requirements of Regulation (EU) No\xa0648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories\n(2014/755/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The procedure for recognition of central counterparties (‘CCPs’) established in third countries set out in Article\xa025 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 aims to allow CCPs established and authorised in third countries whose regulatory standards are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation to provide clearing services to clearing members or trading venues established in the Union. That recognition procedure and the equivalence decision provided for therein thus contribute to the achievement of the overarching aim of Regulation (EU) No\xa0648/2012 to reduce systemic risk by extending the use of safe and sound CCPs to clear over-the-counter (‘OTC’) derivative contracts, including where those CCPs are established and authorised in a third country.\n\n((2)) In order for a third country legal regime to be considered equivalent to the legal regime of the Union in respect of CCPs, the substantial outcome of the applicable legal and supervisory arrangements should be equivalent to Union requirements in respect of the regulatory objectives they achieve. The purpose of this equivalence assessment is therefore to verify that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs established and authorised therein do not expose clearing members and trading venues established in the Union to a higher level of risk than the latter could be exposed to by CCPs authorised in the Union and, consequently, do not pose unacceptable levels of systemic risk in the Union.\n\n((3)) On 1 September 2013, the Commission received the technical advice of the European Securities and Markets Authority (‘ESMA’) on the legal and supervisory arrangements applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia. The technical advice concludes that all of the provisions in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 are replicated by corresponding legally binding requirements which are applicable, at a jurisdictional level, to CCPs authorised in Australia.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, three conditions need to be fulfilled in order to determine that the legal and supervisory arrangements of a third country regarding CCPs authorised therein are equivalent to those laid down in that Regulation.\n\n((5)) According to the first condition, CCPs authorised in a third country must comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n\n((6)) The legally binding requirements of Australia for CCPs authorised therein consist of the Corporations Act 2001 (‘Corporations Act’), which together with the Corporations Regulations 2001 (‘Corporations Regulations’), establish the legal framework for clearing and settlement facilities (‘CS facilities’). Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act provides that before granting a licence to carry out the activities of clearing or settlement, the Minister must be satisfied, among other things, that the CCP concerned has adequate operating rules and procedures which conform to the applicable laws and regulations to ensure, as far as it is reasonably practicable, that systemic risk is reduced and that the CCP is operated in a fair and effective manner. The CCP must also have adequate arrangements for handling conflicts of interest and for enforcing its internal rules and procedures. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (‘ASIC’) and the Reserve Bank of Australia (‘RBA’) advise the Minister regarding the granting of CS facilities' licences and changes of their internal rules and procedures, and are in charge of assessing, and in the case of ASIC of enforcing, CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act.\n\n((7)) ASIC provides regulatory guidance to regulated entities to explain specific issues already covered by legislation. In particular, ASIC revised its regulatory guidance on licensing and oversight of CS facilities' licences in December 2012 under the updated Regulatory Guide 211 ‘Clearing and settlement facilities: Australian and overseas operators’ (‘RG 211’). ASIC's RG 211 implements the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (‘PFMIs’) issued in April 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems(2)(‘CPSS’) and the International Organization of Securities Commission (‘IOSCO’), which are relevant for the obligations set out in the Corporations Act, and provides guidance to CCPs on how to comply with their obligations under the Corporations Act. Therefore, failure to comply with the Corporations Act as explained in RG 211 could entail enforcement action and sanctioning measures.\n\n((8)) RBA has the power, under the Corporations Act, to determine financial stability standards for the purpose of ensuring that CCPs operate in a way that causes or promotes the overall stability of the Australian financial system. In particular, in November 2012, RBA's Payments System Board approved the determination of new financial stability standards, the Financial Stability Standards for Central Counterparties (‘FSS’), which comprise 21 standards for CCPs, with accompanying sub-standards and guidance. Other than certain sub-standards, which came into effect on 31 March 2014, the FSS became effective in March 2013. The FSS are to be complied with by all licensed CCPs.\n\n((9)) The core principles for CS facilities set out in Part 7.3 of the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under ASIC's RG 211, and the FSS determined by RBA (together ‘the primary rules’), set out the high-level standards with which CCPs must comply in order to obtain authorisation to provide clearing services in Australia. Those primary rules comprise the first tier of the legally binding requirements in Australia. In order to comply with the primary rules, CCPs adopt, in addition, their internal rules and procedures which must conform with the specific requirements set out in the Corporations Act and the Corporations Regulations, as explained under RG 211, and the FSS, which are submitted to the Minister prior to authorisation as a CS facility. Changes to the internal rules and procedures of CCPs must be notified to the Minister. The Minister can disallow changes in the internal rules and procedures of CCPs. The internal rules and procedures of CCPs have the effect of a contract and are legally binding on CCPs and their respective participants.\n\n((10)) The legally binding requirements set out in the primary rules applicable to CCPs authorised in Australia deliver substantial results equivalent to those of the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n\n((11)) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia ensure that CCPs authorised therein comply with legally binding requirements which are equivalent to the requirements laid down in Title IV of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012.\n\n((12)) According to the second condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein must provide for effective supervision and enforcement of those CCPs on an ongoing basis.\n\n((13)) CCPs authorised in Australia are subject to on-going supervision and oversight by ASIC and RBA. ASIC is responsible for enforcing CCPs' compliance with their obligations under the Corporations Act and in this respect, it conducts periodic assessments of compliance by CCPs with their licence obligations, other than their obligations relating to FSS and systemic risk reduction, and in particular with their duty to operate in a fair and effective manner to the extent it is reasonable to do so, and submits a report to the Minister, which is published. RBA monitors compliance by CCPs with their obligations under their respective licences and relating to financial stability and reduction of systemic risk, conducts periodic assessments of compliance by each CCP with the FSS and submits a report to the Minister, which is also published. CCPs authorised in Australia may receive written directions from the Minister and from ASIC. If a CCP fails to comply with a written direction, ASIC may apply to the courts which may order the CCP to comply with the written direction.\n\n((14)) The Commission therefore concludes that the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia in respect of CCPs authorised therein provide for effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis.\n\n((15)) According to the third condition under Article 25(6) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, the legal and supervisory arrangements of Australia must include an effective equivalent system for the recognition of CCPs authorised under third country legal regimes (‘third country CCPs’).\n\n((16)) Third country CCPs may apply for an ‘overseas clearing and settlement facility licence’ (‘an overseas CCP licence’) enabling them to provide in Australia some or all of the clearing services they are authorised to provide in their home country.\n\n((17)) The criteria applied to third country CCPs applying for an overseas CCP licence in Australia are comparable to those provided for third country CCPs applying for recognition under Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No\xa0648/2012.

Whereas:
(1) Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1750/1999 of 23 July 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2075/2000(5), lays down the conditions with which all agri-environment undertakings to extensify livestock farming or otherwise to manage livestock farming must comply. According to that Article, livestock density is defined taking into account all grazing livestock kept on the farm.
(2) In view of the difficult situation on the beef and veal market resulting from the sharp drop in demand, due in particular to consumers turning away from beef because of concerns about the increased number of bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases, more cattle are remaining on farms. These animals are taken into account when establishing the holding's stocking density and farmers may accordingly not receive the aid and be penalised for not complying with their undertaking.
(3) In order to avoid penalising farmers in these exceptional circumstances, a corrective flat-rate coefficient should be applied for a limited period, to avoid impairing the environmental value of such undertakings, to the number of livestock units recorded on the holding for the period in question when establishing the stocking density, provided that the farmer demonstrates the impact of this exceptional market situation on the extensive nature of the holding, without affecting the principle of extensification.
(4) If the application of the coefficient does not make it possible to comply with the livestock density laid down in the undertaking or if the difficult situation on the beef and veal market should persist beyond this period, thus making it impossible to comply with the environment undertakings relating, in particular, to the extensification of cattle farming, farmers should be allowed to withdraw their undertaking before expiry of the period covered by that undertaking or to modify their undertaking by removing the obligation to extensify cattle farming without the penalties normally provided for in these circumstances being applied, provided that the farmer demonstrates the impact of this exceptional market situation on the extensive nature of the holding.

(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community(4) (ESA 95) contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States.
(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 sets out the conditions under which the Commission may adopt amendments to the ESA 95 methodology which are intended to clarify and improve its content.
(3) It is therefore necessary to refer the clarifications concerning the recording of taxes and social contributions in ESA 95 to the European Parliament and to the Council as these clarifications modify basic concepts.
(4) Article 2 of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure relating to Article 104 of the Treaty states that the government deficit means net borrowing of the general government sector as defined in the European system of integrated economic accounts (ESA).

(6) The SPC and the CMFB have been consulted.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 4102/88 of 16 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain plywoods of coniferous species (1989)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Community has undertaken to open an annual Community tariff quota of a least 600 000 cubic metres for certain plywoods of coniferous species; whereas this quota has been raised to 650 000 cubic metres by virtue of an agreement concluded with  the United States and approved by Decision 87/224/EEC (1); whereas, under Protocol 11 to the 1972 Act of Accession, the Community is required to open each year autonomous nil duty Community tariff quotas for the same products, the volume thereof to be  decided annually when it is established that all possibilities of supply on the internal market of the Community have been exhausted during the period for which the quotas are open; whereas the condition laid down by the said Protocol does not seem to  be met at the moment; whereas, in these circumstances, it is appropriate as an initial measure not to exceed the contractual volume of 650 000 cubic metres; whereas the setting of the quota volume at this level does not exclude, moreover, recourse to  the provisions of the abovementioned Protocol 11 during the quota period; whereas, therefore, the tariff quota in question should be opened on 1 January 1989;
Whereas, for 1989, maintenance of the quotas for the Member States is necessary bearing in mind that it is impossible for the administration concerned in each Member State to introduce, in 1989, the administrative and technical basis for Community  administration of the quota;
Whereas, to allow for import trends for the products concerned, the quota should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among the Member States, and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States which  have used up their initial shares; whereas, in order to afford importers some degree of certainty, the first part of the quota should be set at a relatively high level, about 60 % of its full amount; whereas, on the basis of Member States' estimates of their needs, the initial shares could be as set out in Article 2;
Whereas Member States may use up their initial shares at different rates; whereas, to provide for this eventuality and to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies, any Member State which has used up its initial share should draw additional shares  in quantities corresponding to their real requirements, as many times as the reserve allows; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between Member States and the Commission and the latter must be able to monitor the extent to  which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if, during the quota period, the Community reserve is almost totally used up, it is essential that Member States return to the said reserve the whole of the unused proportion of their initial quota and of any drawings made, in order to avoid one  part of the Community tariff quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of quota shares allocated to that  economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4102/88 of 16 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain plywoods of coniferous species (1989)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 1.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(2), allows for the fixing of a corrective amount for the products listed in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92. That corrective amount must be calculated taking account of the factors referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
(3) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the corrective amount according to destination.
(4) The corrective amount must be fixed at the same time as the refund and according to the same procedure; it may be altered in the period between fixings.
(5) It follows from applying the provisions set out above that the corrective amount must be as set out in the Annex hereto.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (1) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Financial Regulation’), and in particular Article 84 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union (2) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Rules of Application’), and in particular Article 94 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes (3), and in particular Article 12(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (4), and in particular Article 2(1)(i) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (5), and in particular Article 66(1)(b) and (c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 lays down general rules for the performance of official controls to verify compliance with rules aiming, in particular, at preventing, eliminating or reducing to acceptable levels risks to humans and animals and guaranteeing fair practices in feed and food trade and protecting consumer interests. Article 51 of that Regulation provides that the Commission may organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States responsible for the official controls referred to in that Regulation, which may be opened to participants from third countries, in particular developing countries. Those courses may include in particular training on Community feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare rules.
(2) Article 2(1)(i) of Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community provides the legal instrument for organising courses in the field of plant health.
(3) The ‘Better training for safer food’ programme has been established by the Commission in order to achieve the aims set out in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. The Commission Communication of 20 September 2006 on ‘Better training for safer food’ (6) explores options for future organisation of training.
(4) The 2013 work programme on training in the field of food and feed safety, animal health, animal welfare and plant health for the implementation of ‘Better training for safer food’ programme in Member States should therefore be adopted.
(5) Commission Decision 2008/544/EC (7) of 20 June 2008 transformed the ‘Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme’ into the ‘Executive Agency for Health and Consumers’ (hereafter ‘the Agency’). Commission Decision C(2008) 4943 of 9 September 2008 delegated to the Agency certain management and programme implementation tasks pertaining to the food safety training measures performed pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and Directive 2000/29/EC. A subsidy should therefore be granted to the Agency in 2013 for financing the operating costs of the activities related to the ‘Better training for safer food’ programme.
(6) In accordance with Article 84 of the Financial Regulation and Article 94(1) of the Rules of Application, the commitment of expenditure from the budget of the European Union shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.
(7) The 2013 work programme being a sufficiently detailed framework, the present decision constitutes a financing decision within the meaning of Article 94(2) and (3) of the Rules of Application.
(8) For the application of this Decision, it is appropriate to define the term ‘substantial change’, within the meaning of Article 94(4) of the Rules of Application.
(9) Pursuant to Article 92 of the Financial Regulation, the validation, authorisation and payment of expenditure must be completed within the time limits laid down in the Rules of Application. Those rules are also to specify the circumstances in which creditors paid late are entitled to receive default interest charged to the line from which the principal was paid.
(10) This Decision should therefore provide rules on the payment of default interest due for late payments related to actions included in the 2013 work programme,",{'header': '15.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 170/38'}

(3)  Having been informed of these conclusions, the Ukrainian authorities, in conjunction with two  Ukrainian exporters, and the two South African exporters, offered undertakings to the Commission  with regard to the import prices in the Community pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No  2423/88.
(4)  The minimum prices set out in the undertakings for exports to the Community are at a level  sufficient to eliminate injurious dumping.
(5)  In addition, since the Ukrainian authorities, the two Ukrainian exporting companies and the  two South African exporters have undertaken to submit detailed and regular sales information to the  Commission and not to enter into direct or indirect compensatory arrangements with their customers  and since exports from both countries have been made through a limited number of purchasers, it has  been concluded that the correct observance of the undertakings can effectively be monitored by the  Commission.
(6)  As far as Ukraine in concerned, the Government, implementing two Presidential decrees, dated  August and November 1994, set up an Interministerial Commission on anti-dumping investigations of  goods originating in Ukraine, in order to prevent the export of Ukrainian goods at dumped prices.  In this framework the Ukrainian Government will operate an export licensing system for the duration  of the undertakings which will ensure that all imports into the Community benefiting from the  exemption of the obligation to pay anti-dumping duties subsequent to the undertakings, have  Ukrainian origin, have been produced, will be exported and invoiced directly by the exporters  concerned to first unrelated buyers in the Community at prices not below the minimum price laid  down in the undertakings. Any intended exports of the product by the exporters subject to the  undertakings from the territory of Ukraine to the Community, whether directly or indirectly, which  do not meet these criteria, will not receive an export licence.
(7)  One South African exporter sells a part of its exports to the Community through a related  importer in the Community. The undertaking provides for sales by the related importer to be  incorporated in the minimum price mechanism and monitoring procedure.
(8)  Under these circumstances, the undertakings offered by the Ukrainian authorities, in  conjunction with two Ukrainian exporters, and by the two South African exporters are considered  acceptable and the investigation can, therefore, be terminated with respect to the Ukrainian and  South African exporters concerned. Where there is reason to believe that an undertaking is being  infringed, a provisional duty may be imposed pursuant to Articles 7 and 8 (10) of Regulation (EC)  No 3283/94 and, should the conditions of Article 8 (9) of the Regulation be met, a definitive  anti-dumping duty will be imposed.
(9)  As far as imports of FeSiMn originating in Georgia are concerned, the investigation confirmed  the findings reported in the provisional duty Regulation, that imports of FeSiMn from Georgia were  de minimis and, therefore, did not cause injury to the Community industry. Such a finding has not  been contested by either the Community industry or the other exporters. Consequently, the  proceeding should be terminated with respect to imports of FeSiMn originating in Georgia.
(10)  When the Advisory Committee was consulted on the acceptance of the undertakings offered some  objections were raised. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 9 (1) and 10 (1) of Regulation (EEC)  No 2423/88, the Commission sent a report to the Council on the result of the consultations and a  proposal for the acceptance of the undertakings. As the Council has not decided otherwise within  one month, this Decision should be adopted. No objections were raised concerning the termination of  the proceecing with relation to Georgia,","{'title': '95/418/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 1995 accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Brazil and South Africa and terminating the proceeding against Georgia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertakings offered by the Ukrainian authorities in conjunction  with Nikopol Ferro Alloy Plant and Zaporozhye Ferro Alloy Plant, Ukraine and by Highveld Steel and  Vanadium Corporation Limited and Samancor Limited, South Africa, in connection with the  anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of Ferro-Silico-Manganese originating in Russia,  Ukraine, Georgia, Brazil and South Africa and falling within CN code 7202  30  00 are hereby  accepted.\n\nThe investigation in respect of these exporters is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe proceeding concerning imports of ferro-silico-manganese originating in Georgia is  hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 26 July 1995.\n\nFor the Commission Leon BRITTAN Vice-President'}]}"
