(1) Article 19.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank provides that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) may establish regulations concerning the calculation and determination of the required minimum reserves. The details on the application of minimum reserves are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2003/9) (3).
(2) On 3 July 2014 the Governing Council decided to change the frequency of its monetary policy meetings from a four-week cycle to a six-week cycle as of 1 January 2015 and to extend the reserve maintenance periods from four weeks to six weeks accordingly.
(3) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 (ECB/2003/9), the maintenance period is the period over which compliance with reserve requirements is calculated and for which such minimum reserves must be held on reserve accounts.
(4) The change in the length of the maintenance periods does not affect calculation of the amount of minimum reserves to be fulfilled during a maintenance period for institutions that are subject to the full reporting requirements under Regulation (EU) No 1071/2013 of the European Central Bank (ECB/2013/33) (4).

On the other hand, the change in the length of the maintenance periods does affect calculation of the amount of minimum reserves for institutions that report data on a quarterly basis under Regulation (EU) No 1071/2013 (ECB/2013/33), as the quarterly period will now comprise two maintenance periods.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/71 of 21 June 1971 (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee established by Article 3 of that Regulation,
Whereas imports of textile products on the Community market have during recent years given rise to market disturbance and are causing serious damage to Community producers resulting in the closure of factories and considerable loss of employment;
Whereas, in consequence of this situation, imports of certain textile products originating in the majority of low-cost supplier countries are at present subject to a Community system of authorization and quantitative limitation;
Whereas imports into the Community of T-shirts (category 4) originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 43 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 58 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas imports into the Community of trousers (category 6) originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 25 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 43 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas imports into the Community of knickers (category 13) originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 22 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 122 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas imports into the Community of outer garments (category 83) originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 39 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 131 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas the extremely rapid increase in recent months of imports into the Community of T-shirts, trousers, knickers, bed linen and other outer garments originating in Turkey, have helped to exacerbate the cumulative disturbance of these markets and that, in 1982 and 1983 the Community was obliged to submit, particularly, the import of T-shirts, trousers and other outer garments to Community or regional quantitative restrictions;
Whereas the volume of this increase makes it necessary to take immediate action aimed at avoiding irreparable damage to Community producers; whereas it therefore justifies the adoption, pursuant to Article 60 of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey, of the safeguard measures needed to overcome these difficulties;
Whereas imports into France of dresses (category 26) originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 31 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 207 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas imports into the United Kingdom of category 32 textile products covered by NIMEXE code 58.04-69 originating in Turkey in the first two months of 1984 have already reached 23 % of imports of 1983, which represents an increase of 135 % compared with the same period in 1983;
Whereas the extremely rapid increase in recent months of imports into France of dresses and into the United Kingdom of velvet originating in Turkey have helped to exacerbate the cumulative disturbance of those markets;
Whereas the volume of this increase and the United Kingdom and French request make it necessary to make immediate action aimed at avoiding irreparable damage to United Kingdom and French producers and a serious deterioration in the economic situation of those regions of the Community; whereas it therefore justifies the adoption, pursuant to Article 60 of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and Turkey, of the safeguard measures needed to overcome these difficulties,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1258/84 of 4 May 1984 making the importation of certain textile products originating in Turkey subject to quantitative limitation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) Point 2 of Part II of that Annex provides that, where day-old chicks are not reared in the Member State which imported the hatching eggs, they are to be transported directly to the final destination and kept there for at least three weeks from the date of hatching. That requirement is reflected in Part I of the relevant model veterinary certificate for day-old chicks laid down in Annex IV to Directive 2009/158/EC.
(3) Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 sets out the specific conditions which apply to imports of ratites for breeding and production, hatching eggs and day-old chicks thereof.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 provides for a common monitoring and evaluation framework for measuring the performance of the common agricultural policy (CAP). For the application of that framework, rules need to be laid down which ensure a comprehensive and regular assessment of the progress, effectiveness and efficiency of the CAP against objectives. In order to allow Member States and the Commission to put in place a consistent monitoring and evaluation framework, a set of common indicators as referred to in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 should be laid down.
(2) Those indicators should be linked to the structure and objectives of the CAP and be based on measurable elements. Therefore, different types of indicators should be laid down in order to allow for the assessment of the CAP at all levels. Impact indicators should reflect the common main objectives of the CAP as set out in Article 110(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For each of those common main objectives more specific objectives can be identified, for which result indicators need to be laid down. Those specific objectives include farm income and farm income variability, improvement of the competitiveness of the agricultural sector, market stability, consumer expectations, provision of public goods and environmental preservation, climate change mitigation and adaptation and maintenance of a diverse agriculture, as well as the specific objectives defined for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), namely the Union priorities for rural development. In addition, the practical implementation of the CAP instruments should be monitored on the basis of output indicators that are able to reflect this operational level of the CAP.
(3) It is important to ensure that the monitoring and evaluation framework can be used by Member States and the Commission efficiently and at the appropriate time. It should therefore be provided that Member States send the information necessary for the monitoring and evaluation of the CAP within the deadlines set by the relevant Regulations. With a view to avoiding any undue administrative burden, the Commission should, to the extent possible, use information already made available to it,

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (3), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC, and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
(1) Whereas new information has been published in the United Kingdom further supporting the hypothesis that exposure to the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent is linked to the new variant of Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD) in humans; whereas on 16 September 1997 the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) of the United Kingdom concluded that recent research provided compelling new evidence that the agent which causes BSE is identical to the agent which causes the new variant of CJD in humans; whereas on 18 September 1997 the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) concluded that the BSE agent should now be classified as a human pathogen under Directive 90/425/EEC, the Member State of origin or dispatch is required to implement on its territory the appropriate measures to prevent all situations likely to constitute a serious hazard to animals or to human health;
(2) Whereas, pursuant to Council Directive 82/894/EEC (4), as last amended by Commission Decision 98/12/EC (5), Member States have since 1990 been obliged to notify all cases of BSE to the Commission and to the other Member States;
(3) Whereas pursuant to Council Directive 91/68/EEC (6), as last amended by Commission Decision 94/953/EC (7), since 1993 scrapie must be an officially notifiable disease in all Member States;
(4) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee has stated on the basis of its risk assessment that several Member States including the United Kingdom have reported scrapie in native-born sheep, that the presence of scrapie cannot be excluded in any Member State where sheep are present and that only a thorough epidemiological investigation conducted to common standards will give the necessary information about the scrapie status of each country;
(5) Whereas inspections were carried out in Member States in 1996 and 1997 to check the implementation of Community measures on BSE; whereas the results of those inspections have revealed certain deficiencies, in particular in surveillance and implementation of the prohibition on use of mammalian protein in ruminant feed;
(6) Whereas in view of previous trade in certain products, in particular meat and bone meal and live animals, the possible presence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) agents cannot be ruled out in any of the Member States, subject to further scientific evaluation;
(7) Whereas the World Organisation for Animal Health (Office International des Epizooties (OIE)) in its international animal health code on bovine spongiform encephalopathy of May 1997 has recommended minimum requirements for effective surveillance; whereas the OIE has adopted guidelines for continuous surveillance and monitoring of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in its Code of January 1997;
(8) Whereas the Scientific Veterinary Committee in its report on surveillance of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of 11 June 1997 has laid down guidelines taking account of the recommendations of the OIE;
(9) Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with that opinion and represent a harmonised approach towards effective TSE surveillance in the Member States; whereas more detailed rules will be laid down in Council legislation based on Article 100a of the Treaty;

","Commission Regulation (EC) No 1732/2003
of 30 September 2003
fixing the export refunds on beef and veal
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 32/82(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 744/2000(4), Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2772/2000(6), Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3661/92(8), Regulation (EEC) No 2973/79(9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3434/87(10), and Regulation (EC) No 2051/96(11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2333/96(12), lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products, and for certain destinations.
(3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below.
(4) With regard to live animals, for reasons of simplification export refunds should no longer be granted for categories with insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover, in light of the general concern of animal welfare, export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible. Consequently, export refunds for such animals should only be granted for third countries which for cultural and/or religious reasons traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter. As to live animals for reproduction, in order to prevent any abuse export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age.
(5) Export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some fresh or chilled meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0201, on some frozen meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0202, on some meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 0206 and on some other prepared or preserved meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 1602 50 10.
(6) In the case of meat of bovine animals, boned or boneless, salted and dried, there are traditional trade flows to Switzerland. To allow this trade to continue, the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss market and export prices in the Member States.
(7) In the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80, the Community presence of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present available.
(8) In the case of other beef and veal products, a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant.
(9) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(14), establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds.
(10) In order to simplify customs export formalities for operators, the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought into line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.
(11) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(15), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(16).
(12) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(17), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(18), Council Directive 94/65/EC(19), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003, and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(20), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(21), respectively.
(13) Under Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(14) The negotiations on the adoption of additional concessions, held within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and the associated central and eastern European Countries, aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market in beef and veal. To this end, it was decided to abolish export refunds on products intended for export to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Rumania and Slovakia. These countries should therefore be excluded from the list of destinations giving rise to the grant of a refund, while ensuring that the abolition of refunds for these countries may not lead to the creation of a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular Article 63 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (2), and in particular Article 167 and Article 170 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 162 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 products listed in that article to be exported with or without further processing may be eligible to export refunds if they comply with specific conditions laid down in Article 167 of the said Regulation. Moreover, Article 167(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 gives the possibility to the Commission to establish further conditions for the granting of export refunds for one or more products. Those conditions are currently laid down in the Council regulations on the common organisation of the market in the sectors listed in Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Since those regulations are to be repealed pursuant to Article 201 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, horizontal provisions should be established as from the dates of application of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as provided for in Article 204 of that Regulation.
(2) Horizontal provisions already exist in Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3). It is therefore appropriate to adapt that Regulation in order to establish the conditions referred to in Article 167(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Council regulations on the common organisation of the markets in the poultry, eggs, pigmeat and rice sectors enabled eligibility to export refunds for non-Community originating products which were imported and subsequently exported while they were not sufficiently processed within the meaning of Article 24 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code (4). The refunds in that case are limited to the import duties paid and in addition the exporter had to prove that import and export products are one and the same. As the application of the rule is cumbersome and of very low practical use, from a point of view of simplification and harmonisation it should not be maintained.
(4) Community origin as a prerequisite for eligibility to export refunds is an important safeguard against abuse of the Community budget. In particular, it is aimed at preventing diversion of trade in the form of import operations which would have no commercial purpose related to the placing of goods on the EU market, but which would be motivated solely by the opportunity to collect export refunds upon export. This safeguard has been in place for the cereals, rice, beef and veal, milk and milk products, pigmeat, eggs and poultrymeat and should be maintained. In the interest of continuous protection against abuse of the Community budget, a horizontal provision covering all sectors listed in Article 162 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 is necessary.
(5) As regards sugar, with a view to organising flow of supplies to refineries throughout the Community, special preferential arrangement for access to the Community market has been introduced in the successive common market organisations for sugar, allowing the refining industry to import on special terms certain quantities of raw cane sugar originating in the ACP States party to Protocol No 3 to Annex IV to the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement and in India and other States under agreements with those States. This preferential import arrangement has been implemented within the framework of the common organisation of the market in sugar. Consequently, Article 27(12) (b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (5) provided that refunds had to be granted for the products imported under this arrangement. Following the same approach, the Council decided that the proof of Community origin had not to be required for eligibility of refunds under the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector established by Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 (6). The requirement of Community origin should therefore not apply to the sugar sector.
(6) Pursuant to the abolition of export refunds for some products, the list of products for which the refunds has to be fixed on the basis of an ingredient when compound products qualify for a refund became shorter. It is therefore appropriate to mention only the remaining products in this respect.
(7) The requirement of Community origin in the cereals sector has already been laid down in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (7). For the sake of transparency and rationalisation this requirement should be replaced by the horizontal provision establishing the requirement of Community origin.
(8) Regulations (EC) No 1501/95 and (EC) No 800/1999 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '5.6.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 146/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 499/2008\nof 4 June 2008\namending Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 and Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as regards the conditions of granting export refunds on agricultural products', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 162 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 products listed in that article to be exported with or without further processing may be eligible to export refunds if they comply with specific conditions laid down in Article 167 of the said Regulation.

fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1450/2002 of 8 August 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 9 August 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 August 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas recommendation 84/549/EEC (4) calls for the introduction of services on the basis of a common harmonized approach in the field of telecommunications;
Whereas the Council in its resolution of 30 June 1988 (5) on the development of the common market for telecommunications services and equipment calls for the promotion of Europe-wide services according to market requirements;
Whereas the resources offered by modern telecommunications networks should be utilized to the full for the economic development of the Community;
Whereas Council Directive 89/336/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility (6) is applicable, and particular attention should be taken to avoid harmful electromagnetic interference;
Whereas current cordless telephone systems in use in the Community, and the frequency bands they operate in, vary widely and may not allow the benefits of Europe-wide services or benefit from the economies of scale associated with a truly European market;
Whereas the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI) is currently developing the European Telecommunications Standard (ETS) or digital European cordless telecommunications (DECT);
Whereas the development of the European Telecommunications Standard (ETS) must take account of the safety of users, and the need for Europe-wide interoperability and enable users provided with a service based on DECT technology in one Member State to gain access to the service in any other Member State, where appropriate;
Whereas the European implementation of DECT will provide an important opportunity to establish truly European digital cordless telephone facilities;
Whereas ETSI has estimated that DECT will require 20 MHz in high density areas;
Whereas the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) has recommended the common European frequency band 1880-1900 MHz for DECT, recognizing that, subject to the system, development of DECT additional frequency spectrum may be required;
Whereas this should be taken into account in the preparation for the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC);
Whereas after the date of designation of the frequency band for DECT, existing services may continue in the band, providing that they do not interfere with DECT systems that may be established according to commercial demand;
Whereas the implementation of Council recommendation 91/288/EEC of 3 June 1991 on the coordinated introduction of DECT into the Community (7), will ensure the implementation of DECT by 31 December 1992 at the latest;
Whereas Council Directive 91/263/EEC of 29 April 1991 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning telecommunications terminal equipment, including the mutual recognition of their conformity (8) will allow the rapid establishment of common conformity specifications for DECT;
Whereas the establishment of DECT depends on the allocation and availability of a frequency band in order to transmit and receive between fixed-base stations and mobile stations;
Whereas some flexibility will be needed in order to take account of different frequency requirements in different Member States; it will be necessary to ensure that such flexibility does not slow down the implementation of DECT technology according to commercial demand across the Community;
Whereas the progressive availability of the full range of the frequency band set out above will be indispensable for the establishment of DECT on a Europe-wide basis,",{'title': 'Council Directive 91/287/EEC of 3 June 1991 on the frequency band to be designated for the coordinated introduction of digital European cordless telecommunications (DECT) into the Community'}

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(10), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(11), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(12), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(13), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(14) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(15) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(9) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(16), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(10), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(11), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(12), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(13), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(14) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(15) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(9) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(16), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.

Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 provides for the Council to take all necessary  measures in the event of an appreciable revaluation, which, primarily to comply with obligations  under the GATT Agreement and budgetary discipline, may involve derogations from the provisions of  the said Regulation concerning aid and the amount by which the monetary gaps are dismantled,  without, however, resulting in the threshold being extended; whereas the measures provided for in  Articles 7 and 8 of the said Regulation cannot be applied as they stand; whereas it is necessary to  take steps at Community level to prevent distortions of monetary origin affecting the  implementation of the common agricultural policy;
Whereas on the basis of the information available it is impossible to know what the situation will  be after 30 June 1996; whereas application of the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1527/95  would be justified in similar cases up to that time; whereas the amounts of the aid provided for in  Regulation (EC) No 1527/95 must be determined using the criteria employed when that Regulation was  adopted, and in particular by reference to the most recent data available; whereas, in order to  reflect the most recent data available, the amount of the aid must be fixed for those Member  States, such as Finland and Sweden at present for which there is a risk of an appreciable reduction  in the agricultural conversion rate,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2990/95 of 18 December 1995 regulating compensation for appreciable reductions in the agricultural conversion rates before 1 July 1996', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation shall apply in the event of significant reductions in  agricultural conversion rates in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 up to 30  June 1996.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

entering a name in the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Karlovarské trojhránky (PGI))
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 6(2) and in accordance with Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Czech Republic’s application of 19 October 2004 to register the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2).
(2) Austria and Germany submitted objections to the registration pursuant to Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. The objections were deemed admissible under points (a), (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) By letters dated 6 May 2008, the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement among themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.
(4) Given that no agreement was reached between Austria and the Czech Republic nor between Germany and the Czech Republic within the designated timeframe, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(5) Concerning the alleged failure of compliance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 regarding an absence of production in the geographical area and the quality of its reputation, the national authorities responsible confirmed that production took place in the geographical zone. The link was based on the specific quality of the product attributable to the geographical area, namely the thermal spring water used in production, which is sufficient to meet the requirements of point (b) of Article 2(1); whether or not the product also had sufficient reputation to satisfy the requirements of Article 2(1) was immaterial.
(6) The statements of objection from Germany showed that trade marks including the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ had been registered prior to the application for registration of the term ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ as a protected geographical indication. Evidence was further provided to show that consumers in Germany associated the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ with a certain type of wafer. However no evidence was provided in the statements of objection that consumers strongly associated the wafers with all or any of the trade marks as distinct from the descriptive term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, nor that consumers would be liable to be misled as to the true identity of a product marketed under the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’. Therefore, the Commission cannot conclude that the registration of the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ would be contrary to Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(7) As a salient part of the names ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ and ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ is identical, it is reasonable to conclude that the names are partly identical for the purposes of point (c) of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. Furthermore, given the similarities between the products and their common origins, the application of the protection envisaged by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, and in particular point (b) of paragraph (1) thereof, could have the result that ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’, if registered, would be found by a competent court to be protected against the use of ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ on the wafers concerned. The evidence therefore shows that the continued existence of the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ could be jeopardised by the registration of ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ within the meaning of point (c) of Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(8) The statements of objection were declared admissible on the ground, inter alia, that registration of the proposed name would jeopardise the existence of a partly identical name, namely ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, in so far that this name is used on product and not protected under trade mark legislation. The evidence further shows that the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ originated from producers in the town formerly known as Karlsbad and that production of the wafer so named has continued for a considerable period of time. Moreover, the evidence shows that the uses of the name ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ referred to an authentic and traditional product that was not exploiting the reputation of ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’. For these reasons the maximum transitional period foreseen by Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 should be foreseen.
(9) Concerning trade marks containing the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ that were protected through registration or acquired by use prior to the application for registration of ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’, the conditions of Article 14(1) not being met, the said trade marks cannot be invalidated nor can their continued use be hindered by virtue of the registration of ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ as a protected geographical indication, provided the general requirements under trade mark legislation are otherwise met.
(10) Concerning generic status, the evidence provided in the statements of objection referred to the general use of the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ and not to that of ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’. While the objections have provided evidence to show that a number of uses as general descriptive terms exist including the German mention ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’, no evidence has been provided that the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ is used to designate a category of products that do not originate in the region of Karlovy Vary. The objection does not take into consideration the situation in the Czech Republic. Therefore, on the basis of information provided the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ cannot be considered to be generic and there is no failure of compliance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(11) In the light of the above, the name ‘Karlovarské trojhránky’ should be entered in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications subject to a transitional period of 5 years during which time the term ‘Karlsbader Oblaten’ may continue to be used in circumstances that, but for the transitional period, could be contrary to the protection provided for by Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Article 65 thereof;
Having regard to the application submitted by the undertakings concerned on 10 December 1974,
WHEREAS:
I    1. On 10 December 1974, several French undertakings engaged in the production of steel within the meaning of Article 80 of the Treaty applied to the Commission for authorization of an agreement concerning, inter alia, the joint buying of prereduced iron ore through the Société Française des Minerais Préréduits S.A., Paris (SFMP), a company with a share capital of FF 1 000 000.
The undertakings concerned are the following: >PIC FILE= ""T0006874"">
>PIC FILE= ""T0006875"">
2. SFMP will have the following objects:      (1) Studies : to keep its shareholders informed of current studies and research on the direct reduction of iron ore;
(2) Supplies : to negotiate, whether in its own name or in the name and for the account of its shareholders or of other firms, medium and long-term supply contracts for prereduced iron ore;
(3) Representation : to represent its shareholders in dealings with foreign undertakings interested in participating in setting up direct reduction plants;
(4) Setting up plants : to study and possibly set up and operate direct reduction plants in its own name, or for account of all or some of its shareholders, acting either alone or with third parties.
3. As regards supplies (object (2) above) SFMP will purchase prereduced material to the order and for the account of its members on a brokerage basis, the commission charged by SFMP going to cover its own costs. SFMP will not have the exclusive right to make such purchases, but any member undertakings intending to obtain supplies direct will inform SFMP's Chairman in advance.
4. In principle, direct reduction plants (object (4) above) would be set up and operated in conjunction with SFMP by undertakings specially formed for the purpose.
5. Subject to the possibility of earlier dissolution, reduction or extension, SFMP will be formed for a period of 99 years running from its incorporation.
6. SFMP will be run by a Board of not less than three and not more than 12 Directors appointed for a maximum term of office of six years by the shareholders in General Meeting.
II    7. The agreement restricts the normal play of competition between the undertakings involved in that they agree:      - to share products and sources of supply by coordinating their purchases of prereduced iron ore through SFMP ; and
- to control investment in and production of prereduced iron ore through SFMP, either alone or together with third parties.
8. Accordingly, the agreement is caught by the prohibition in Article 65 (1), even if to some extent it only constitutes a declaration of intent to be clarified  subsequently as regards the terms on which direct reduction plants will be set up and operated.
9. Article 65 (2) empowers the Commission to authorize specialization agreements or joint buying or joint selling agreements and certain agreements strictly analogous in nature and effect, where it finds that the tests of that Article are satisfied.
10. The coordination envisaged by the firms, in obtaining supplies of prereduced iron ore through SFMP, is strictly analogous to a joint buying agreement ; while coordination of investments and plant operation can be regarded as strictly analogous to specialization.
11. The agreement may thus be authorized under Article 65 (2) if and to the extent that it makes for a substantial improvement in the production or distribution of the products in question, if it is essential in order to achieve these results and if it is not more restrictive than is necessary for that purpose. It must also be shown that the agreement is not liable to give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices or to control or to restrict the production or marketing of a substantial part of the products in question within the common market, or to shield them against effective competition from other undertakings within the common market.
III    12. The undertakings which are party to the agreement account for some 95 % of crude steel production in France.
13. Prereduced iron ore constitutes a high quality substitute for scrap for all purposes, but particularly in electrical steel furnaces. Prereduction processes have been developed to an important extent only in recent times, with a number of projects being carried out or studied throughout the world, particularly in non-Community countries which are rich in iron ore and/or in hydrocarbons.
14. So far the only Community country in which prereduction of iron ore has reached the stage of industrial production is the Federal Republic of Germany, although a number of major projects are being considered elsewhere in the Community.
15. World production of prereduced iron ore is running at an annual rate of some six million metric tons ; of this total, only half a million metric tons are produced in the Community, where total crude steel production in 1973 was 150 million metric tons, using 100 million metric tons of pig iron and about 63 million metric tons of scrap. Consumption of prereduced iron ore in the Community has hitherto been insignificant as compared with total steel production.
16. Taking account of the plants already planned in other Community countries, world prereduced iron ore production could reach some 30 million metric tons by 1980, although a major part of this production will probably be used in steel melting shops down-stream from the direct reduction plants themselves. Hence the tonnages available for export to Community countries are likely to remain relatively low.
17. Both in the Community and elsewhere electrical steel melting shops and the continuous casting process are showing a particularly strong upsurge in popularity at a time when, as can be seen from ""Report on Investment in the Community coalmining and iron and steel industries"" published by the Commission in September 1974, the decline of the open hearth process is slowing down. As the continuous casting process is adopted by more and more steel works, the quantity of scrap arising in the works will fall noticeably. Both the electrical and open hearth processes are based primarily on scrap. These trends ""will not fail to influence the demand for scrap, a raw material for which supply is not particularly elastic. In addition, the direct reduction of iron ore does not seem likely to supply substitute products in appreciable quantities in the medium term"" (op. cit.).
18. Accordingly, although economic pressures are lower in the present time of reduced business activity, it must be assumed that in the medium term there will be a serious shortage of scrap. It is therefore desirable for the largest possible quantities of prereduced iron ore to become available either from non-Community countries or from plants to be set up within the Community, to take the place of some of this scrap.
IV    19. The joint buying of prereduced iron ore envisaged by the parties to this agreement will enable them to order larger tonnages and thus to claim higher bulk discounts and reduce their transport costs ; this will permit a cut in supply costs. Medium-term contracts will enable them to guarantee stability both of supplies and of prices, particularly at times of shortage.
20. In view of the circumstances described above, the joint buying agreement must be regarded as  making for a substantial improvement in the production of crude steel and steel products.
21. The agreement is essential in order to achieve these results, for comparable improvements would be out of the question if each individual undertaking purchased prereduced iron ore separately.
22. The joint buying agreement does not give SFMP exclusive control over such purchases. The fact that the member undertakings undertake to inform SFMP's Chairman in advance when they propose to make direct purchases does not give the Chairman any right of veto but simply assists the coordination which is necessary to ensure the improvements referred to in paragraph 19.
23. In these circumstances, the joint buying agreement is no more restrictive than is required for its purpose and it satisfies the tests of Article 65 (2) (a) and (b).
24. The joint buying agreement will not give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the general level of prices or production of prereduced iron ore, for this will be determined rather by the world supply and demand situation and by the current actual and relative prices for scrap and for pig iron (which in many cases can be replaced by scrap and prereduced iron). Joint buying does not give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices or to control or restrict the production or marketing of a substantial part of the products in question within the common market ; accordingly, as regards joint buying, the agreement satisfies the tests of Article 65 (2) (c).
V    25. As regards the building and operating of prereduction plants, the agreement provides only a framework and the details will have to be filled in before a final decision can be given as to its compatibility with Article 65 (2) or, as the case may be, Article 66 (2). Among other things, it will have to be established with certainty that no proposals to cooperate on such plants would give the undertakings concerned the power to determine the prices or to control or restrict the production or marketing of a substantial part of prereduced iron ore in the common market.
26. Consequently, SFMP and the member undertakings will be required to inform the Commission of any proposal for building or operating a direct reduction plant within the Community. Such a proposal may not become operational until the Commission has granted an authorization under Article 65 or 66 of the Treaty.
VI    27. The objects of the studies and the representation function to be carried out by SFMP (objects (1) and (3) referred to in paragraph 2 above) will be to keep abreast of developments in the various prereduction processes, to study the technical and economic possibilities for siting plants, either in France or in other countries, to assess processes and products and to provide the necessary contacts with third parties for the attainment of these objects. On these points the agreement is not restrictive of competition.
VII    28. The Commission needs to be in a position to monitor the development of cooperation between steel undertakings regarding the joint supply of prereduced iron ore. SFMP and the undertakings concerned will therefore have to notify the Commission without delay of any change in the number of shareholders of SFMP and of any change or addition to the agreement or to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of SFMP and to refrain from operating them until the Commission has stated that they are acceptable, or, as the case maybe, has authorized them under Article 65 of the Treaty.
29. Having regard to the conditions imposed above the agreement is compatible with Article 65 (2) of the Treaty,","{'title': '75/569/ECSC: Commission Decision of 3 July 1975 authorizing an agreement between several steel industry undertakings concerning the joint buying of prereduced iron ore (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe agreement between the following undertakings:\n\nUSINOR - Union Sidérurgique du Nord et de l'Est de la France S.A., Paris,\n\nSACILOR - Aciéries et Laminoirs de Lorraine S.A., Hayange, Châtillon-Commentry-Biache, S.A., Paris, S.A. des hauts fourneaux de la Chiers, Longwy-Bas, Creusot-Loire S.A., Paris, Ugine Aciers S.A., Paris, Société des aciéries et tréfileries de Neuves-Maisons, Châtillon S.A., Neuves-Maisons, Forges d'Allevard, Paris, S.A.

of 24 January 2000
amending Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems originating in Japan
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURES
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94(2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems (hereinafter ""TCS"") originating in Japan.
(2) The Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty the professional camera systems listed in the Annex to that Regulation (hereinafter referred to as ""the Annex""), representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94, but which cannot be regarded as broadcast cameras.
(3) In October 1995, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2474/95(3), amended the abovementioned Regulation (EC) No 1015/94, in particular as regards the like product definition and as regards certain models of professional camera systems explicitly exempted from the scope of the definitive anti-dumping duty.
(4) In October 1997, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1952/97(4) amended the rates of the definitive anti-dumping duty for two companies concerned, namely for Sony Corporation and Ikegami Tsushinki in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96. Furthermore, the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty certain new models of professional camera systems adding them to the Annex.
(5) In January 1999, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 193/1999(5) amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to its Annex and thus excluding those from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty.
B. INVESTIGATION CONCERNING NEW MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL CAMERA SYSTEMS
1. Procedure
(6) Subsequently, a number of Japanese exporting producers informed the Commission that they intended to introduce new models of professional camera systems into the Community market and requested to add these new models of professional camera systems and their accessories to the Annex and thus exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties.
(7) The Commission informed the Community industry accordingly and commenced an investigation limited to the determination of whether the products under consideration fall within the scope of the anti-dumping duties and whether the operational part of Regulation 1015/94 should be amended accordingly.
2. Models under investigation

3. Findings
(9) The Commission carried out a technical examination including a detailed comparison of the models concerned with their predecessor models listed in the Annex and found that they were almost completely identical. The small differences found are the result of the technical development in the TCS sector but did not affect the classification of these TCS as professional camera systems. Therefore, it was concluded that all models concerned should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures.
(10) The Commission informed the Community producers and the exporters of TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. On this basis and in the light of the fact that the interested parties did not object to the Commission's conclusions, all models and related equipment listed in recital (8) are professional camera systems. It follows that they should be exempted from the application of the anti-dumping duty applicable to certain television camera systems originating in Japan, and that the Annex should be amended accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 176/2000 of 24 January 2000 amending Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems originating in Japan', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 shall be replaced by the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Commission.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 24 January 2000.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

Whereas the conversion coefficients for expressing a quantity of boned meat or cooked preparation in carcase weight should be fixed; whereas such coefficients must be established in the light of the experience gained by the beef and veal industry;
Whereas, in order to ensure the regularity of imports, the said quantities should be spread over several periods of the year;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3667/84 (2) instituted a system of import authorizations in France for certain beach slippers, slippers and other indoor footwear originating in the People's Republic of China and falling within NIMEXE codes ex 64.04-10, ex 64.04-90 and ex 64.02-69 respectively;
Whereas that Regulation takes account of the steps taken by the Government of the People's Republic of China both in order to make exports into France of the products in question subject to export certificates, and to issue such certificates in such a way as to respect certain quantitative limits for 1985, 1986 and 1987;
Whereas disparities exist between France and the other Member States in the conditions governing imports of the products in question; whereas such disparities may give rise to deflection of trade;
Whereas in order to detect rapidly such deflection of trade, the French Government has made a request to the Commission of the European Communities to be authorized to establish prior intra-Community surveillance of the imports in question originating in the People's Republic of China and put into free circulation in the other Member States;
Whereas the Commission has examined whether the imports in question could be the subject of intra-Community surveillance measures; whereas that examination shows that such deflection of trade may increase and jeopardize the objectives pursued by Regulation (EEC) No 3667/84 referred to above and aggravate or prolong the economic difficulties of the manufacturing sector concerned;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to authorize France to introduce intra-Community surveillance of the products in question originating in the People's Republic of China and put into free circulation in the other Member States,","{'title': ""85/144/EEC: Commission Decision of 15 January 1985 authorizing the French Republic to introduce intra- Community surveillance in respect of imports of certain beach slippers, slippers and other indoor footwear originating in the People's Republic of China (Only the French text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nIn accordance with Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC, the French Republic is hereby authorized to establish, until 31 December 1987, intra-Community surveil\n\nlance of the products indicated below originating in the People's Republic of China and put into free circulation in the other Member States.\n\n1.2.3 //   //   //   // CCT heading No  // NIMEXE code (1985)  // Description  //   //   //   // ex 64.04  // ex 64.04-10  // Slippers and other indoor footwear  // ex 64.04  // ex 64.04-90  // Beach slippers  // ex 64.02 B  // ex 64.02-69  // Beach slippers with rubber soles  //   //   //""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 15 January 1985.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilly DE CLERCQ\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 16, 22. 1. 1980, p. 14.\n\n(2) OJ No L 340, 28. 12. 1984, p. 30.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 9,055 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C (96) 3158 of 9 December 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 9 December 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Auvergne; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/1 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of France;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3793/85 (2), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8 (4) thereof,
Whereas there are at present considerable stocks of common wheat of bread-making quality without any foreseeable outlets in the near future; whereas this situation is threatening to undermine the stability of the market in that product; whereas, consequently, in accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, provision should be made for the application of special intervention measures consisting of the purchase of common wheat of a quality to be determined;
Whereas such purchases will be made in accordance with the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1629/77 of 20 July 1977 laying down detailed rules of application for special intervention measures to support the development of the market in common wheat of bread-making quality (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2215/84 (4);
Whereas, however, the situation of the market in common wheat of bread-making quality is characterized by differing price levels and disposal possiblilities in the various Member States; whereas this situation justifies the fixing of maximum quantities that may be accepted into intervention in the individual Member States;
Whereas purchases should be made in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2738/75 of 29 October 1975 laying down general rules for intervention on the market in cereals (5);
Whereas, since the quantities to be purchased are limited, measures must be applied to ensure that bona fide offers are made to the intervention agencies; whereas, to this end, provision should be made for the lodging, at the time when offers are submitted, of a security which will be forfeit if the offer is withdrawn or if the offer relates to a quality inferior to the minimum quality or if the offer does not correspond to a quantity actually held in store by the offerer;
Whereas, furthermore, since the quantities to be purchased are limited, a procedure must be applied by the Member States to ensure that offers accepted do not exceed the quantitative limits imposed; whereas, this procedure must provide in particular for the fixing of a percentage reduction to be applied if the volume of offers exceeds the limits imposed;
Whereas, the cost of testing and transporting goods offered is borne by the person making the offer; whereas this cost may prove excessive when, after the percentage reduction laid down is applied, the quantity eligible for purchase is below the minimum tonnage provided for in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1629/77; whereas, in order to mitigate any disadvantages which could arise therefrom, the persons who have made offers should be authorized to withdraw the offers for the quantities in question without impairing their rights to the release of the security; whereas, however, the quantities withdrawn in this way should not be allocated to the other persons who submitted offers;
Whereas, in view of the qualitative requirements laid down, for the purpose of applying the special intervention measure, a difference of 5 % should be adopted between the price for common wheat of the quality taken into consideration and the price determined in accordance with Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2124/85 (6);

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3) and 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 28 February 2005, BASF Plant Science GmbH, submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 for food and feed uses, food and feed containing, consisting, or produced from potato EH92-527-1, with the exception of cultivation.
(2) It follows from the application that feed produced from genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 is, as for any conventional starch potato, a by-product of the starch processing and is the only intended use in the food and feed chains.
(3) On 10 November 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting, or produced from potato EH92-527-1 (2) as described in the application (the products) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment. In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities, as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(4) Accordingly, EFSA advised that no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 are necessary. EFSA also considered that no specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, and no specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of the Regulation, had to be applied.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA concluded that the environmental monitoring plan submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended uses of the products. This environmental monitoring will be carried out for the purpose of Commission Decision 2010/135/EU of 2 March 2010 concerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a potato product (Solanum tuberosum L. line EH92-527-1) genetically modified for enhanced content of the amylopectin component of starch (3).
(6) On 26 February 2007, in the light of a report published by the World Health Organisation listing kanamycin and neomycin as ‘critically important antibacterial agents for human medicine and for risk management strategies of non-human use’, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement highlighting the therapeutic relevance of both antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. On 13 April 2007, taking into account this statement, EFSA indicated that the therapeutic effect of the antibiotics at stake will not be compromised by the presence of the nptII gene in GM plants. This is due to the extremely low probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria and its subsequent expression and to the fact that this antibiotic resistant gene in bacteria is already widespread in the environment. It thus confirmed its previous assessment of the safe use of the antibiotic resistance marker gene nptII in genetically modified organisms and their derived products for food and feed uses.
(7) On 14 May 2008, the Commission sent a mandate to EFSA, with a request: (i) to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion taking into account the previous opinion and the statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market and their possible uses for import and processing and for cultivation; (ii) to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing ARM genes. The mandate brought to the attention of EFSA, inter alia, letters by the Commission from Denmark and Greenpeace.
(8) On 11 June 2009, EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes that the previous assessment of EFSA on genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement, and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion.
(9) In the light of the above considerations, authorisation should be granted.
(10) The authorisation for the cultivation and industrial use of potato EH92-527-1 is provided by Decision 2010/135/EU that is providing for conditions for use and handling that aim to avoid any co-mingling with material derived from conventional potatoes intended for food or feed.
(11) Despite the application of these measures, it can not be excluded that the genetically modified potato and some products of the starch processing may be present in food or feed. Such a presence should be considered adventitious or technically unavoidable and can be accepted provided it is in a proportion no higher than 0,9 %.
(12) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(13) All information contained in the Annex to this Decision on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in the Regulation.
(14) In accordance with Articles 4(2) and 16(2) of the Regulation, the conditions for authorisation of the products bind all persons placing them on the market.
(15) This Decision should be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (5).
(16) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman.
(17) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,","{'header': '4.3.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 53/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 2 March 2010\nauthorising the placing on the market of feed produced from the genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 (BPS-25271-9) and the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of the potato in food and other feed products under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2010) 1196)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/136/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 28 February 2005, BASF Plant Science GmbH, submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 for food and feed uses, food and feed containing, consisting, or produced from potato EH92-527-1, with the exception of cultivation.\n\n((2)) It follows from the application that feed produced from genetically modified potato EH92-527-1 is, as for any conventional starch potato, a by-product of the starch processing and is the only intended use in the food and feed chains.\n\n((3)) On 10 November 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting, or produced from potato EH92-527-1(2)as described in the application (the products) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment.

Whereas, under Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas cucumbers are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas cucumbers harvested during a given crop year are marketed from January to December;
Whereas the quantities harvested during January and the first 10 days of February and during the last 20 days of November and December are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for all the year; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 11 February up to and including 10 November;
Whereas, Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 140 (2) and 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Spanish and Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first phase in the case of Spain and during the first stage in the case of Portugal;
Whereas Community produced cucumbers are grown mainly under glass; whereas the reference prices for the marketing year must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas cucumbers imported from certain third countries during the same period will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such cucumbers may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for cucumbers not grown under glass should therefore be adjusted by a conversion factor;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2), and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products referred to in Part XIX of Annex I to that Regulation and prices in the Union for those products may be covered by an export refund.
(2) In view of the current situation on the market in eggs, export refunds should be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that refunds may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products which are authorised to move freely within the Union and comply with requirements under Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2) and of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3), as well as marking requirements under point A of Annex XIV to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 47/2012 (4). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 2 July 2010, Syngenta Seeds SAS submitted to the competent authority of Germany an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MIR162 maize (the application).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of MIR162 maize in products consisting of it or containing it for any other uses than food and feed as any other maize, with the exception of cultivation.
(3) In accordance with Article 5(5) and Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the application includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. It also includes a monitoring plan for environmental effects conforming with Annex VII to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(4) On 21 June 2012, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. It concluded that MIR162 maize, as described in the application, is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health or the environment. Therefore it concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from MIR162 maize as described in the application (the products) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses (3).
(5) In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 6(4) and Article 18(4) of that Regulation.
(6) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended uses of the products.
(7) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted to the products.
(8) A unique identifier should be assigned to each genetically modified organism (hereinafter ‘GMO’) as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(9) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Article 13(1) and Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MIR162 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of products containing or consisting of the GMO with the exception of food products for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements in Article 4(6) for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and those for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(11) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(12) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the EU register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(13) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing-House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (7).
(14) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(15) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit laid down by its Chairman. An implementing act was deemed to be necessary and the chair submitted the draft implementing act to the appeal committee for further deliberation. The appeal committee did not deliver an opinion,","{'header': '20.10.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 290/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 18 October 2012\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize MIR162 (SYN-IR162-4) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2012) 7198)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/651/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 2 July 2010, Syngenta Seeds SAS submitted to the competent authority of Germany an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MIR162 maize (the application).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of MIR162 maize in products consisting of it or containing it for any other uses than food and feed as any other maize, with the exception of cultivation.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 5(5) and Article 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, the application includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC(2)and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2003/18/EC of 19 December 2002 on the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the parties on new mutual agricultural concessions(1), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Decision 2003/18/EC, the Community has undertaken to establish for each marketing year import tariff quotas at a zero rate of duty for wheat and meslin and maize originating in Romania.
(2) To ensure that imports of wheat and maize covered by these tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences should be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties, subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.
(3) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for the lodging of licence applications should be laid down and the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.
(4) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.
(5) With a view to the sound management of the quotas, provision should be made to derogate from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(3), as regards the transferable nature of the licences and the tolerance relating to the quantities released into free circulation.
(6) To ensure sound management of the quotas, the security on the import licences should be set at a relatively high level, by way of derogation from Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2305/2002(5).
(7) Rapid two-way communication should be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.
(8) As Council Regulation (EC) No 2435/2000 of 17 October 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Romania(6) has been repealed by Decision 2003/18/EC, Commission Regulation (EC) No 2809/2000 of 20 December 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application, for cereals sector products, of Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000, (EC) No 2435/2000 and (EC) No 2851/2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Romania, and the Republic of Poland respectively and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1218/96(7), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2864/2000(8), should be amended.

fixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2009
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas (2), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 of 18 September 2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks (3), and in particular Articles 5 and 8(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, as well as in the light of any advice received from the Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council.
(2) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States.
(3) In order to ensure effective management of fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.
(4) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag.
(5) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities.
(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein are to be identified.
(7) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with Community legislation, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States’ catches of fish (4), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels (5), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels (6), Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic (7), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy (8), Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems (9), and Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound (10) and Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007.
(8) To ensure that annual fishing opportunities are set at a level commensurate with the sustainable exploitation of resources in environmental, economic and social terms, account has been taken of the guiding principles for fixing total allowable catches (TACs) as described in the Communication from the Commission to the Council on fishing opportunities for 2009: Policy Statement from the European Commission.
(9) To help conserve fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2009.
(10) To ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2009. Given the urgency of the matter, it is imperative to grant an exception to the six-week period referred to in point I(3) of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaties establishing the European Communities,","{'header': '23.12.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 345/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1322/2008\nof 28 November 2008\nfixing the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea for 2009', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 requires the Council to adopt the measures necessary to ensure access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities taking account of available scientific advice and, in particular, the report prepared by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, as well as in the light of any advice received from the Baltic Sea Regional Advisory Council.\n\n((2)) Under Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish fishing opportunity limits by fishery or group of fisheries and the allocation of these opportunities to Member States.\n\n((3)) In order to ensure effective management of fishing opportunities, the specific conditions under which fishing operations are carried out should be established.\n\n((4)) The principles and certain procedures for fishery management need to be laid down at Community level, so that Member States can ensure the management of the vessels flying their flag.\n\n((5)) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 lays down definitions of relevance for the allocation of fishing opportunities.\n\n((6)) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96, the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein are to be identified.\n\n((7)) Fishing opportunities should be used in accordance with Community legislation, and in particular with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2807/83 of 22 September 1983 laying down detailed rules for recording information on Member States’ catches of fish(4), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining characteristics for fishing vessels(5), Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1381/87 of 20 May 1987 establishing detailed rules concerning the marking and documentation of fishing vessels(6), Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the North-East Atlantic(7), Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 of 12 October 1993 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy(8), Commission Regulation (EC) No 2244/2003 of 18 December 2003 laying down detailed provisions regarding satellite-based Vessel Monitoring Systems(9), and Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 of 21 December 2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound(10)and Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007.\n\n((8)) To ensure that annual fishing opportunities are set at a level commensurate with the sustainable exploitation of resources in environmental, economic and social terms, account has been taken of the guiding principles for fixing total allowable catches (TACs) as described in the Communication from the Commission to the Council on fishing opportunities for 2009: Policy Statement from the European Commission.\n\n((9)) To help conserve fish stocks, certain supplementary measures on technical conditions of fishing should be implemented in 2009.\n\n((10)) To ensure the livelihood of Community fishermen, it is important to open these fisheries on 1 January 2009.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(1), (b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(2) High levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China. Melamine is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of amino resins and plastics and is used as a monomer and as an additive for plastics. High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.
(3) To counter the risk for health that may result from exposure to the melamine content of feed and food products, Commission Decision 2008/798/EC imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC, provides for a prohibition to import into the Community products containing milk or milk products, intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children, and requires Member States to perform systematic checks at import on other feed and food containing milk or milk products. That Decision also requires Member States to withdraw from the market any such product found to contain melamine in excess of 2,5 mg/kg product.
(4) According to information made available by the Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food, high level of melamine have been found recently also in products containing soya or soya products imported from China. Melamine has also been found in ammonium bicarbonate, used in food industry as raising agent. It is therefore appropriate to extend the measures laid down in Commission Decision 2008/798/EC also to those products.

High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.\n\n((3)) To counter the risk for health that may result from exposure to the melamine content of feed and food products, Commission Decision 2008/798/EC imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC, provides for a prohibition to import into the Community products containing milk or milk products, intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children, and requires Member States to perform systematic checks at import on other feed and food containing milk or milk products. That Decision also requires Member States to withdraw from the market any such product found to contain melamine in excess of 2,5 mg/kg product.\n\n((4)) According to information made available by the Member States through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food, high level of melamine have been found recently also in products containing soya or soya products imported from China. Melamine has also been found in ammonium bicarbonate, used in food industry as raising agent. It is therefore appropriate to extend the measures laid down in Commission Decision 2008/798/EC also to those products.\n\n((5)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2008/798/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nIn Article 2, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘Member States shall prohibit the import into the Community of products containing milk, milk products, soya or soya products intended for the particular nutritional use of infants and young children within the meaning of Council Directive 89/398/EEC on foods for particular nutritional uses, originating or consigned from China.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products(1), as last amended by Directive 98/45/EC(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to obtain, for one or more of the mollusc diseases bonamiosis and marteiliosis - if caused by the agents Bonamia ostreae (B. ostreae) and Marteilia refringens (M. Refrigens) - the status of approved zone, Member States shall submit the appropriate justifications and the national rules ensuring compliance with the conditions laid down in Directive 91/67/EEC.
(2) Commission Decision 93/55/EEC(3), as amended by Decision 93/169/EEC(4), amends the guarantees for the introduction of molluscs into zones for which a programme for B. ostreae and M. refringens has been approved.
(3) The programme concerning bonamiosis and marteiliosis in Ireland was approved by Commission Decision 93/56/EEC(5).
(4) Council Regulation (EEC) No 706/73 of 12 March 1973 concerning the Community arrangements applicable to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man for trade in agricultural products(6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1174/86(7), lays down that the veterinary legislation shall apply to these islands under the same conditions as in the United Kingdom for the products imported to the islands or exported from the islands to the Community.
(5) The programmes concerning bonamiosis and marteiliosis submitted by the United Kingdom were approved by Commission Decisions 92/528/EEC(8) (Great Britain and Northern Ireland), 93/57/EEC(9) (Jersey), 93/58/EEC(10) (Guernsey) and 93/59/EEC(11) (the Isle of Man) respectively.
(6) Ireland has submitted the appropriate justifications required to obtain the status of approved zone, with regard to B. ostreae and M. refringens, for certain areas of Ireland, as well as the national rules ensuring compliance with the requirements for maintenance of the approved status.
(7) The United Kingdom has submitted the appropriate justifications required to obtain the status of approved zones, with regard to B. ostreae and M. refringens, for certain areas, as well as the respective national rules ensuring compliance with the requirements for maintenance of the approved status.
(8) The documentation provided by Ireland and the United Kingdom for the zones concerned shows that these zones meet the requirements of Article 5 of Council Directive 91/67/EEC. They therefore qualify for the status of approved zones.
(9) For the sake of clarity and simplification, it is appropriate to draw up a single list of all approved zones with regard to bonamiosis and marteiliosis and to repeal decisions approving programmes earlier applied to the zones that subsequently have achieved approved status.
(10) Decisions 92/528/EEC, 93/56/EEC, 93/57/EEC, 93/58/EEC and 93/59/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Decision.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For cyflumetofen the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2010/244/EU (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 21 September 2009 an application from Otsuka Chemical Co. Ltd for the inclusion of the active substance cyflumetofen in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2010/244/EU confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 12 November 2010.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance cyflumetofen (4) on 16 December 2011. The draft assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and was finalised on 20 November 2012 in the format of the Commission review report for cyflumetofen.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing cyflumetofen may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve cyflumetofen.
(6) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions. It is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(8) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing cyflumetofen. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(9) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((10)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances(6)should be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nApproval of active substance\nThe active substance cyflumetofen, as specified in Annex I, is approved subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Re-evaluation of plant protection products', 'text': 'Article 2\nRe-evaluation of plant protection products\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing cyflumetofen as an active substance by 30 November 2013.\nBy that date they shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to this Regulation are met, with the exception of those identified in the column on specific provisions of that Annex, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to Directive 91/414/EEC in accordance with the conditions of Article 13(1) to (4) of that Directive and Article 62 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, for each authorised plant protection product containing cyflumetofen as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances, all of which were listed in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 by 31 May 2013 at the latest, Member States shall re-evaluate the product in accordance with the uniform principles, as referred to in Article 29(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, on the basis of a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex III to Directive 91/414/EEC and taking into account the column on specific provisions of Annex I to this Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular Article 36(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) contained the list of active substances approved at Union level for inclusion in biocidal products. Commission Directives 2008/78/EC (3), 2008/79/EC (4) and 2008/86/EC (5) added the active substances propiconazole, IPBC and tebuconazole, respectively, for use in products belonging to product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC. By virtue of Article 86 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012, these substances are therefore approved active substances included in the list referred to in Article 9(2) of that Regulation.
(2) In accordance with Article 8 of Directive 98/8/EC, the company Arch Timber Protection Ltd submitted on 2 April 2010 an application to The United Kingdom for authorisation of a wood preservative biocidal product containing propiconazole, IPBC and tebuconazole (‘the contested product’). The United Kingdom authorised the contested product on 7 June 2012 for industrial use and temporary protection of freshly sawn/felled wood and unseasoned timber only, also indicating that wood treated with this product can be used for Use Classes 2 and 3 as described in the Technical Notes for Guidance on Product Evaluation (6). The product consists of two packs to be mixed and diluted at industrial premises depending on site-specific application conditions by dipping or enclosed deluge. Ten Member States have subsequently authorised the contested product through mutual recognition.
(3) Arch Timber Protection Ltd (‘the applicant’) submitted on 16 July 2012 a complete application to Germany for mutual recognition of the authorisation of the contested product granted by the United Kingdom.
(4) Germany notified the Commission, the other Member States and the applicant on 19 August 2013 of its proposal to refuse the authorisation in accordance with Article 4(4) of Directive 98/8/EC. Germany considered that the contested product does not meet the requirements of Article 5(1) of Directive 98/8/EC with regard to the environment.
(5) According to Germany, the authorisation did not reflect well that the product was intended for temporary wood protection and the product was not appropriately assessed by the United Kingdom in terms of environmental risks. The assessment performed by Germany concluded in an unacceptable risk for the environment at day 30 following the application of the product (‘time 1’), which also raised concerns regarding the potential use of wood treated with the contested product under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions.
(6) Germany also considered that, since the ratio of the active substances and non-active substances in the working solutions of the product is variable, the product does not meet the definition of biocidal products in Article 2(a) of Directive 98/8/EC and should have been authorised as a frame formulation as defined by Article 2(j) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(7) The Commission invited other Member States and the applicant to submit comments to the notification in writing within 90 days in accordance with Article 27(1) of Directive 98/8/EC. Comments were submitted within that deadline by Germany, The United Kingdom and the applicant. The notification was also discussed on 24 September 2013 in the meeting of the coordination group established under Article 35 of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) With regard to the risks for the environment, from those discussions and comments it follows that the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom, in the absence of an agreed model for temporary wood protection, followed the best guidance available at the time (7), which is based on models for treated wood to be placed on the market under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions. The assessment was also based on a worst-case assumption of a complete release of the active substances at time 1.
(9) It also follows that the evaluation performed by the United Kingdom following those models is compatible with current guidance (8). Where a risk is identified at time 1 as a result of a worst-case assumption, safe use of treated wood under Use Classes 2 and 3 conditions can be assumed when the risk for the environment at the end of the service life is considered acceptable.
(10) The Commission also notes that cases where an unacceptable risk is identified at time 1 are currently under discussion at Union level in order to establish a harmonised approach. Against this background the Commission considers that, until such an approach is formally adopted, the conclusions of the assessment of the contested product by the United Kingdom should be considered as valid until the renewal of the product authorisation.
(11) With regard to the identity of the product, from those discussions and comments it follows that the contested product, in the form in which it is supplied to the industrial users, has specific fixed concentrations of the active and non-active substances. The Commission considers that the fact that industrial users can prepare different solutions of the product at the work place, which are process dependant, cannot be interpreted in a way as if the authorisation holder was placing on the market a group of different biocidal products as referred to in Article 2(j) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) In the light of those arguments, the Commission supports the conclusions of the evaluation carried out by the United Kingdom and the other Member States having approved the product through mutual recognition, considering that the contested product meets the definition in Article 2(a) of Directive 98/8/EC and fulfils the requirements set by Article 5(1) of that Directive with regard to the environment. The Commission therefore considers that the request by Germany to refuse the authorisation cannot be justified on the grounds put forward.
(13) Finally, on the basis of the discussions held, it appears necessary to explicitly mention in the product authorisation that the use of the product is for temporary wood protection and to ensure, as a condition for the authorisation, that specific instructions for use of the product are provided to industrial users taking into consideration the characteristics of the industrial sites where the product is to be used.
(14) Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 applies to the contested product in accordance with the provisions of Article 92(2) of that Regulation. Since the legal basis for this Decision is Article 36(3) of that Regulation, this decision should be addressed to all Member States by virtue of Article 36(4) of that Regulation.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '31.10.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 311/75', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 29 October 2014\nrejecting the refusal of the authorisation of a biocidal product notified by Germany in accordance with Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2014) 7915)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/758/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)contained the list of active substances approved at Union level for inclusion in biocidal products.

(2) Public sales of wine alcohol for use in the fuel sector in the Community should be organised with a view to reducing Community stocks of wine alcohol and to some extent ensuring supplies to firms approved under Article 92 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the adoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC (2).
(2) The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas. The ICCAT Convention established an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) which adopts conservation and management measures. Those measures become binding on the contracting parties.
(3) In 1998, ICCAT adopted resolution 98-18 concerning the unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale long line vessels in the Convention area. That resolution established procedures for identifying countries whose vessels had fished for tuna and tuna-like species in a manner which diminished the effectiveness of ICCAT conservation and management measures. It also specified measures to be taken, including if necessary non-discriminatory trade restrictive measures, in order to prevent those countries’ vessels from continuing such fishing practices.
(4) Following the adoption of resolution 98-18, ICCAT has identified Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of its conservation and management measures. ICCAT has substantiated its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels.
(5) As a consequence, ICCAT recommended that contracting parties take appropriate measures, consistent with the provisions of its resolution 98-18, to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products in any form from those countries.
(6) In 2004, imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone into the Union were prohibited by Council Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 (3).
(7) At its 14th special meeting in 2004, ICCAT acknowledged the efforts made by Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone to address its concerns and adopted recommendations lifting trade-restrictive measures against those three countries in relation to Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products.
(8) As a consequence, Council Regulation (EC) No 919/2005 (4) amended Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 to lift the prohibition on imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products from Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone into the Union. Following that amendment, Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 only prohibits such imports from Bolivia and Georgia.
(9) At its 22nd regular annual meeting in 2011, ICCAT acknowledged the actions taken by Bolivia and Georgia and adopted recommendation 11-19 lifting the prohibition on imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna and its products that continued to apply to those two countries.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 should therefore be repealed,","{'header': '20.3.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 84/4', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 249/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 26 February 2014\nrepealing Council Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 prohibiting imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1036/2001', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Union has been a contracting party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ICCAT Convention) since 14 November 1997, following the adoption of Council Decision 86/238/EEC(2).\n\n((2)) The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation in the conservation and management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and its adjacent seas.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

As stated by the members of the International Contact Group at their last meeting on 10\xa0September\xa02009, it is desirable that this dialogue should take place. It is already encouraging to see the readiness of the various parties to take part in the dialogue. It seems clear that certain underlying issues cited among the root causes of the coup of 6\xa0August\xa02008 have yet to be resolved. The topics for dialogue referred to in the Dakar Agreement include reinforcing democracy, preventing unconstitutional changes of government, reforming the institutions and the role of the armed forces, good political and economic governance, reinforcing the rule of law and human rights and restoring the balance of institutions and power. The security threats that have emerged in Mauritania underline the need, in this dialogue, to address security related issues, including the link between security and\xa0development.\nThe European Union attaches great importance to all issues relating to the stability of your country, including those mentioned above. As these are subjects of mutual interest and given the scale of European Union cooperation in Mauritania in the area of governance, we propose that the political dialogue between Mauritania and the European Union, as provided for in Article 8 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, be strengthened and put on a regular and structured footing. The practical arrangements and terms of reference for this dialogue will have to be established by mutual agreement between your Government and the heads of the European Union’s diplomatic missions to the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.\nOne of the objectives of this dialogue will be to promote the inclusive national dialogue mentioned above and to closely monitor its results. We believe that the preconditions and difficulties that have beset the launching of this dialogue could be resolved if the various Mauritanian parties were to focus their discussions on the future and set aside demands and disputes relating to the recent past.\nTo conclude, the European Union will support Mauritania’s efforts to overcome the socio-economic and political difficulties that it is experiencing owing to the long-running political crisis connected with the coup of August 2008, the global economic crisis and the new security and terrorist threats.\nWe have the honour to be, Sir, yours faithfully,\nDone at Brussels, 25 January 2010.\nFor the European Commission\nJosé Manuel BARROSO\nFor the Council of the European Union\nC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 36(3) thereof,
Having consulted the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Networking between the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Authority’) and the Member States’ organisations operating in the fields within the Authority’s mission is one of the basic principles of the Authority’s operation. It is therefore necessary to stipulate how this principle should be implemented, in accordance with Article 36(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, in order to ensure efficiency.
(2) Certain bodies in the Member States carry out tasks at national level which are similar to those of the Authority. Networking must make it possible to foster a framework for scientific cooperation allowing information and knowledge to be shared, common tasks to be identified, and optimum use to be made of resources and expertise. It is also important to facilitate the compilation of a Community-level summary of the data on food and feed safety collected by these bodies.
(3) As these bodies are to be entrusted with certain tasks with a view to assisting the Authority with its general mission as defined by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is essential for them to be designated by the Member States on the basis of criteria covering scientific and technical competence, efficiency and independence.
(4) Member States need to provide the Authority with evidence of compliance with the necessary criteria for the inclusion of competent bodies on the list drawn up by the Authority’s Management Board.
(5) Member States must also stipulate the specific areas of competence of the competent bodies designated, so as to facilitate the operation of the network. Thus, in accordance with European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 (2), when preparing an opinion on a request for authorisation of a genetically modified food or feed, the Authority may ask a Member State’s competent body for assessing foods and feeds to carry out a safety assessment of the relevant food or feed in accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
(6) In accordance with the provisions of Article 27(4)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is important for the Advisory Forum to be able to ensure close cooperation with the Authority and the competent bodies of the Member States by promoting the European networking of organisations operating within the fields of the Authority’s mission.
(7) The tasks entrusted to the competent bodies on the list must involve providing the Authority with assistance with its mission to provide scientific and technical support in relation to Community policy and legislation, without prejudice to the Authority’s responsibility for performing its tasks pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.
(8) Financial support must be granted on the basis of criteria which ensure that such support contributes efficiently and effectively to the performance of the Authority’s tasks and to the Community priorities as regards scientific and technical support in the fields concerned.
(9) It is important to ensure on a general basis that the tasks entrusted by the Authority to the network’s member organisations are performed to high scientific and technical standards, efficiently (also with regard to deadlines) and independently. However, the Authority must remain responsible for allocating tasks to the competent bodies and for monitoring performance.

Thus, in accordance with European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003(2), when preparing an opinion on a request for authorisation of a genetically modified food or feed, the Authority may ask a Member State’s competent body for assessing foods and feeds to carry out a safety assessment of the relevant food or feed in accordance with Article 36 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n\n((6)) In accordance with the provisions of Article 27(4)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, it is important for the Advisory Forum to be able to ensure close cooperation with the Authority and the competent bodies of the Member States by promoting the European networking of organisations operating within the fields of the Authority’s mission.\n\n((7)) The tasks entrusted to the competent bodies on the list must involve providing the Authority with assistance with its mission to provide scientific and technical support in relation to Community policy and legislation, without prejudice to the Authority’s responsibility for performing its tasks pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.\n\n((8)) Financial support must be granted on the basis of criteria which ensure that such support contributes efficiently and effectively to the performance of the Authority’s tasks and to the Community priorities as regards scientific and technical support in the fields concerned.\n\n((9)) It is important to ensure on a general basis that the tasks entrusted by the Authority to the network’s member organisations are performed to high scientific and technical standards, efficiently (also with regard to deadlines) and independently. However, the Authority must remain responsible for allocating tasks to the competent bodies and for monitoring performance.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Competent organisations designated by the Member States', 'text': 'Article 1\nCompetent organisations designated by the Member States\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The competent organisations designated by the Member States in accordance with Article 36(2) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 shall meet the following criteria:\n(a)\nthey must carry out scientific and technical support tasks in the fields within the mission of the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Authority’), especially those with a direct or indirect impact on food or feed safety; in particular, these tasks must include the collection and analysis of data connected with risk identification, exposure to risks, risk assessment, food or feed safety assessment, scientific or technical studies, or scientific or technical assistance for risk managers;\n(b)\nthey must be legal entities pursuing public interest objectives, and their organisational arrangements must include specific procedures and rules ensuring that any tasks entrusted to them by the Authority will be performed with independence and integrity;\n(c)\nthey must possess a high level of scientific or technical expertise in one or several fields within the Authority’s mission, especially those with a direct or indirect impact on food or feed safety;\n(d)\nthey must have the capacity to operate in a network on scientific actions as referred to in Article 3 of this Regulation and/or the capacity to perform efficiently the types of task referred to in Article 4 of this Regulation which may be entrusted to them by the Authority.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall forward to the Authority, with a copy to the Commission, the names and details of the designated organisations, evidence that they comply with the criteria set out in paragraph 1, and details of their specific fields of competence.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2836/98 of 22 December 1998 on integrating of gender issues in development cooperation
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 130w thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty (2),
(1) Whereas the importance of women's economic and social roles in developing countries has led to increasing international recognition that their full participation without discrimination is indispensable for sustainable and effective development;
(2) Whereas their contribution to development is presently achieved in the face of formidable obstacles specific to women, limiting the outcome of their work and reducing the benefits to society as a whole;
(3) Whereas these obstacles include persistent and severe disparities between women and men in the right to equal participation in development for women, access to basic services, particularly in the areas of education, training and health, access to decision-making and control over economic resources;
(4) Whereas development interventions have frequently failed to address adequately the differences between women's and men's situations, roles, opportunities and priorities, thereby reducing their overall success;
(5) Whereas redressing gender disparities and enhancing the role of women are crucial for social justice and the effectiveness of development efforts;
(6) Whereas development cooperation must encourage the necessary accompanying changes in attitudes, structures and mechanisms at political, economic, legal, community and household level;
(7) Whereas it is now recognized that though specific efforts to enhance the role of women in development remain as necessary as ever, the focus must widen to encompass both men's and women's roles, responsibilities, needs, access to resources and decision-making, and the inter-relationship between them, known as gender issues;
(8) Whereas development effectiveness requires that gender analysis should be systematically integrated into the conception, design, implementation and evaluation of all development interventions and strategies;
(9) Whereas the foregoing analysis is set out in more detail in the Commission's communication to the Council and the European Parliament on integrating gender issues in development cooperation of 18 September 1995 and was endorsed by the Council in its Resolution of 20 December 1995;
(10) Whereas in a series of conclusions from 1982 to 1993 the Council has stressed the importance it attaches to women's role in development;
(11) Whereas the Community and its Member States were signatories to the Nairobi Forward-Looking Strategies in 1985 and to the Declaration and Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women at Beijing in 1995, which stressed the need for action against worldwide obstacles to gender equality and to ensure that this perspective is reflected in all policies and programmes;
(12) Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) considers discrimination against women as an obstacle to development which parties agree to eliminate using all appropriate means, and the UN Declaration on the Right to Development (1986) emphasizes the right of all persons to participate in and contribute to development and the need to undertake effective measures to ensure that women have an active role in the development process;
(13) Whereas the European Parliament has emphasized in numerous Resolutions, and particularly in its Resolution of 14 May 1992 on the situation of women in developing countries and its Resolution of 15 June 1995 on the fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the need to integrate proper attention to women's roles and priorities in Community development cooperation and to take adequate measures to ensure active implementation of the conclusions of the Beijing Conference;
(14) Whereas the Resolution of the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of 20 December 1995 endorses the Commission's communication on the same subject, requires the full integration of gender issues in development cooperation and coordination between the Commission and Member States in this field, and sets out guidelines which also translate into the field of development cooperation the political commitments undertaken at Beijing;
(15) Whereas this approach is further endorsed by the Resolution of the Council and the Member States on human and social development of 22 November 1996;
(16) Whereas the recognized importance of these issues to development effectiveness makes it appropriate to envisage specific activities aimed at ensuring adequate attention to gender issues across the mainstream of Community financial instruments, which should increasingly assume responsibility for these key questions;
(17) Whereas the most effective approach is strategic and precisely targeted sensitization initiatives capable of achieving a substantial multiplier effect, rather than the funding of small-scale operational projects; whereas Community development cooperation aid should also be used to a greater extent for specific action in favour of women;
(18) Whereas the importance of Community activities in the field of development cooperation necessitates measures by the Community to ensure its implementation of its commitments at Beijing, complementary to those undertaken by Member States;
(19) Whereas measures need to be taken to finance the activities covered by this Regulation;
(20) Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 on the incorporation of financial provisions into legislative acts (3) is included in this Regulation for the period 1999 to 2003, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty;
(21) Whereas detailed rules for implementation, and in particular the form of action, the recipients of the aid and the decision-making procedures should be laid down,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2836/98 of 22 December 1998 on integrating of gender issues in development cooperation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(3), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 31 August 1996, the Commission announced, by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(4) as well as an anti-subsidy proceeding(5) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway.
(2) The Commission sought and verified all informaton that it deemed necessary for the purpose of its definitive findings. As a result of this examination, it was established that definitive anti-dumping and countervailing measures should be adopted in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation. All interested parties were informed of the results of the investigation and were given the opportunity to comment thereon.
(3) On 26 September 1997, the Commission adopted Decision 97/634/EC(6), accepting undertakings offered in connection with the two above-mentioned proceedings from the exporters listed in the Annex to the Decision and terminating the investigations in their respect.
(4) On the same day, the Council, by Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(7) and (EC) No 1891/97(8) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. Imports of farmed Atlantic salmon exported by companies from which an undertaking had been accepted were exempted from that duty pursuant to Article 1(2) of those Regulations.
(5) The above-mentioned Regulations set out the definitive findings and conclusions on all aspects of the investigations. The form of the duties having been reviewed, Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 were replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9).
B. OBLIGATIONS OF EXPORTERS WITH UNDERTAKINGS
(6) The text of the undertakings provides that failure to submit a quarterly report of all sales transactions to the first unrelated customer in the Community within a prescribed time-limit would, except in case of force majeure, be construed as a violation of the undertaking.
(7) For the fourth quarter of 1999, one Norwegian company, Fryseriet AS, failed to present such a sales report within the prescribed time limit, despite a reminder sent to it 24 hours before the quaterly deadline. The company was subsequently given an opportunity to inform the Commission of any reasons which may have prevented its report from being received within the time limit, however, no reply was received.
(8) Fryseriet AS was then sent disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties against it. The company was also given an opportunity to submit comments and request a hearing, however, as before, it did not react.
(9) In view of the above, it is considered necessary to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking offered by Fryseriet AS and to impose definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties against it. Accordingly, the name of this company should be deleted from the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC which lists the companies from which undertakings are accepted.
(10) In parallel to this Decision, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1783/2000(10), has also withdrawn the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties granted to this company.
C. NEW EXPORTERS
(11) Following the original imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties, several Norwegian companies have made themselves known to the Commission claiming to be new exporters and requested, in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 in conjuction with Article 11(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 that the exemption to the duties be extended to them.
(12) In this regard, five such exporters, Emborg Foods Norge AS, Helle Mat AS, Norsea Food AS, Salmon Company Fjord Norway AS and Stella Polaris AS demonstrated that they had not exported the product concerned to the Community during the investigation period which led to the current anti-dumping and countervailing duties (""the original investigation period"").
(13) These companies also showed that they are not related to any of the companies in Norway which are subject to anti-dumping and countervailing duties. In addition, they provided evidence of exports of the product concerned to the Community after the original investigation period, or proof that they had entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant amount of the product concerned to the Community.
(14) The companies concerned have offered undertakings which are identical to those previously offered by other Norwegian companies exporting farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. By doing so, they have all agreed to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their exports to the Community.
(15) Since undertakings on such terms can be monitored effectively by the Commission, and their acceptance would eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation, the offers are considered acceptable.
(16) The companies concerned have been informed of the essential facts, considerations and obligations upon which acceptance of the undertakings given by them are based.
(17) Their names should therefore be added to the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
D. CHANGE OF NAME
(18) Two other Norwegian exporters with undertakings, Agnefest AS and Norway Seafoods ASA advised the Commission that the names of the companies have changed to Rosfjord Seafood AS and Frionor AS respectively. The Commission has therefore verified and confirmed that there were no changes to the corporate structure which warranted a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of the companies maintaining their undertakings.
(19) Accordingly, the names of these companies should be amended in the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
E. CESSATION OF TRADING BY A NORWEGIAN COMPANY
(20) The Commission has also been advised that another Norwegian company from which an undertaking was accepted, Atlantic King Stranda A/S, has ceased to trade and has been wound up. Accordingly, the name of this company should be deleted from the list of companies in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Protocol 3 to the 1972 Act of Accession, and in particular Article 1 (2) and the second subparagraph of Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Community rules concerning trade with non-member countries in agricultural products subject to a common organization of the market apply to the Isle of Man in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Protocol 3 to the 1972 Act of Accession and with Regulation (EEC) No 706/73 (1);
Whereas livestock production is a traditional activity in the Isle of Man and plays a central part in the island's agriculture;
Whereas, prior to the introduction of the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat within the Community, the Isle of Man, as part of its local market organization, applied certain mechanisms to control imports of sheepmeat into the island in order to ensure that the need to supply the requirements of the trade could be met whilst avoiding distortions in the pattern of sheep production and, indirectly, in cattle production on the island and in its own agricultural support system;
Whereas in the context of the trade arrangements with certain non-member countries pursuant to the common organization of the market which apply to the Isle of Man, subject to the Community provisions which govern the relationship between the island and the Community, it is desirable to permit the island authorities to apply certain measures in order to protect its own production and the working of its own agricultural support system;
Whereas by Decision 82/530/EEC (2), the United Kingdom was authorized to permit the Isle of Man Government to apply a system of special licences for imports of sheepmeat and beef and veal originating in non-member countries and in Member States of the Community, without prejudice to the measures concerning trade with non-member countries provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (3), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession and Regulation (EEC) No 1837/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 871/84 (5), for a period of two years ending on 31 March 1984;
Whereas, in the light of experience gained during the application of the system in question, it is desirable to extend the system for another five years with the possibility of further reviewing the situation at the end of that period;

(6) The draft Decree, as it currently stands, does not indicate why the substances contained in Annex 4 have to comply with the thresholds thereof based on public health reasons.
(7) In the absence of harmonised Community legislation, Member States retain their competence to regulate the production and marketing of goods in their territory without prejudice to the Articles 28 and 30 of the EC Treaty.
(8) In particular, Article 2(3) of the draft Decree read in conjunction with Annex 4 thereto appears to suggest that substances other than those listed therein are not permitted to be used in the manufacture of food supplements.
(9) Even if were demonstrated that Annex 4 is justified on the basis of public health reasons, the draft decree does not indicate how products, lawfully produced and/or marketed in other Member States that do not comply with the requirements laid down in Articles 2(3) and 4 thereof will be treated.
(10) The draft Decree does not contain any provision ensuring the free movement of food supplements lawfully produced and/or marketed in other Member States which contain substances that are included in Annex 4 thereto but not in accordance with the conditions laid down therein, or substances other than those included in Annex 4 thereto either in the form of a mutual recognition clause or in the form of an approval procedure enabling economic operators to have such substances included on the national list of authorised substances.
(11) Pursuant to Articles 2(3) and 4 of the notified Decree read in conjunction with Annex 5 thereto, food supplements and foodstuffs in general shall contain no narcotic or psychotropic substances, nor precursors of Category 1, nor any other substance demonstrated to have a toxic, genotoxic, teratogenic, hallucinogenic, narcotic or other unfavourable effects on the human body, nor any of the substances contained in Annex 5 thereto. The prohibition of certain other substances for the manufacture of food supplements and foodstuffs in general may be justified on grounds of the protection of health and life of humans within the meaning of Article 30 EC Treaty.
(12) Since the latter article provides for an exception, to be interpreted strictly, to the rule of free movement of goods within the Community, it is for the national authorities which invoke it to show in each case, in the light of national nutritional habits and in the light of the results of international scientific research, that their rules are necessary to give effective protection to the interests referred to in that provision and, in particular, that the marketing of the products in question poses a real risk to public health.
(13) The Czech authorities have not provided any evidence that would justify the establishment of a list containing prohibited substances to be used in the manufacture of food supplements and foodstuffs in general.
(14) Even if such evidence were provided, the draft Decree does not contain any provision ensuring the free movement of food supplements and foodstuffs in general lawfully produced and/or marketed in other Member States which contain substances not permitted thereby.
(15) Therefore, the draft Decree fails to provide adequate guarantees that the rights of the economic operators deriving from Articles 28 and 30 of the EC Treaty.
(16) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006.
(17) The Czech authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft Decree in question and modify it in accordance with Articles 28 and 30 of the EC Treaty taking into account the observations of the Commission in its negative opinion.

Ratu Epeli NAILATIKAU\nPresident of the Republic of Fiji\nSuva\nRepublic of Fiji\nYour Excellency,\nThe European Union (EU) attaches great importance to the provisions of Article 9 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and Article 3 of the Development Cooperation Instrument. The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, which form the essential elements of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, and are the basis of our relations.\nSix years have elapsed since the EU took a decision on the appropriate measures following the military coup of 2006, and since then a set of commitments were agreed with Fiji.\nThe EU notes that since 2007 some of the agreed commitments have become outdated and some are in need of revision in the light of Fiji's new legal framework. In order to have an appropriate basis for assessing Fiji's reform progress, we need to revise these commitments together, taking into account the current situation and the legal framework.\nThe EU has therefore decided to include in its new decision on appropriate measures a requirement that the EU engage with Fiji in an enhanced political dialogue under Article 8 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. This will be with a view to revising together the agreed commitments of 2007, and to adapting the appropriate measures (annexed to this letter) accordingly, as necessary steps towards ensuring respect for human rights, the restoration of democracy and respect for the rule of law, until both parties conclude that the enhanced nature of the dialogue has served its purpose.\nAs some restrictions on certain human rights and fundamental freedoms remain in Fiji, and in light of the necessary revision of the agreed commitments, the EU has decided to extend the appropriate measures by 18 months, until 31 March 2015. This will provide the necessary flexibility and will give both the EU and Fiji the time they need to agree on the commitments, to adapt the appropriate measures accordingly, and for the government to hold its elections planned for September 2014.\nThe EU will monitor the progress made towards a return to constitutional rule and this will continue to guide our upcoming decisions on development cooperation. In this spirit the EU confirms its willingness to engage in preparations for the 11th EDF programming process, and to notify in due course an indicative national financing allocation in this process. The finalisation, signature and implementation of 11th EDF programming documents will be envisaged with the democratically elected government.\nOnce Fiji has held free and fair elections and met the revised agreed commitments, an Article 96 review mission, in line with the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, will be conducted in Fiji. Based on an agreement on the recommendations of this assessment, the Article 96 appropriate measures can then be concluded for Fiji.\nIn order to advance cooperation under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement and the Development Cooperation Instrument, the EU invites the Interim Government to engage in an enhanced political dialogue with the EU, starting as soon as possible.\nThe EU also welcomes the engagement with the Pacific Island's Forum Ministerial Contact Group set up to monitor the progress of Fiji's preparations for the elections and its return to democracy and looks forward to the next steps for a transparent, participatory and credible electoral process, leading to free and fair elections and Fiji's return to democratic rule.\nYours sincerely,\nDone at Brussels,\nFor the Council\nC.

Whereas export refunds on products subject to the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products must be fixed in accordance with certain criteria which would make it possible to cover the difference between the prices for those products within the Community and in international trade, while respecting the general aims of the common organisation ; whereas to this end the supply situation for milk products and prices for these products within the Community and the price situation in international trade should be taken into account;
Whereas, in view of the disparity between the prices quoted for milk products, costs incurred in placing these products on the market should be taken into account for the purpose of covering the difference between prices in international trade and prices ruling within the Community;
Whereas, if price trends are to be noted, prices must be determined in accordance with certain principles ; whereas to this end prices on third country markets and in countries of destination, producer prices recorded in third countries and free-at-Community-frontier prices should be taken into account when prices on the world market are being determined ; whereas, in the absence of representative markets for milk products, the ruling prices which are most favourable from the exportation point of view should be used as a basis in determining Community prices;
Whereas provision must be made for varying the amount of the refund according to the destination of the products, since markets in the countries of destination are at varying distances from Community markets and special conditions apply to imports in certain countries of destination;
Whereas to guarantee Community exporters some stability in the amount of the refund and certainty with regard to the list of products eligible for a refund, refunds should be fixed at regular intervals determined in accordance with normal trade practice ; whereas, for the same reason, provision should be made for advance fixing;
Whereas, to avoid distortions of competition, the administrative conditions under which individual Community traders operate must be identical throughout the Community ; whereas there does not appear to be justification in every case for granting a refund where the products in question are imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries ; whereas the payment, under certain conditions, of an amount equal to the levy collected on importation is sufficient to allow these products to be placed on the world market again;","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 876/68 of the Council of 28 June 1968 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on milk and milk products and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation lays down rules for fixing and granting refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 exported in the state referred to therein.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe following shall be taken into account when refunds are being fixed:    (a) the existing situation and the future trend with regard to:      - prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market;\n\n- prices for milk and milk products in international trade;  1OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 13.\n\n(b) marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports and other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination;\n\n(c) the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products, which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market;\n\n(d) the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market;\n\n(e) the economic aspect of the proposed exports.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas, under Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas cucumbers are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas cucumbers harvested during a given crop year are marketed from January to December;
Whereas the quantities harvested during January and the first 10 days of February and during the last 20 days of November and December are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for all the year; whereas reference prices should be fixed  only for the period 11 February up to and including 10 November;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commerial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;
Whereas Community-produced cucumbers are grown mainly under glass; whereas the reference prices for the marketing year must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas cucumbers imported from certain third countries during the same period  will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such cucumbers may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for cucumbers not grown under glass should therefore be  adjusted by a conversion factor;

Whereas Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3824/92 lays down that the resulting reduction in the prices and amounts for each sector concerned shall be specified and the level of such reduced prices fixed; whereas, however, this adjustment may not result  in a reference price level below that of the preceding marketing year, in accordance with Article 23 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72;

fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Union’s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 8(9) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Articles 18 and 26 of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (2), a manufacturer must ensure that each new light commercial vehicle placed on the market in the Union is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity and a Member State may not register such a vehicle unless it is accompanied by such a certificate. In accordance with Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, data collected by a Member State to monitor the manufacturer’s compliance with Articles 4 and 11 of that Regulation are to be consistent with a certificate of conformity and based on this document only.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community’s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (3) requires the Member States to use the certificate of conformity as a data source but allows for the use of other documents providing equivalent accuracy for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from passenger cars. In order to ensure cost-efficient and accurate monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions data for light commercial vehicles, it is appropriate in the short-term to allow Member States to use the same procedure and data sources for the monitoring and reporting under Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 as those used for reporting under Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 should, where duly justified, allow for the use of other data sources providing equivalent accuracy for CO2 monitoring and reporting purposes. The Member States should put the necessary measures in place to ensure adequate accuracy in the monitoring procedure.
(3) Based on the experience gained from the monitoring of CO2 emissions from passenger cars, it is appropriate, in order to improve the means for verifying the accuracy of the data, to add type-approval number as a detailed data parameter to be reported by Member States. It has also become evident that there is no need for the parameter ‘commercial name’ which therefore should be deleted from the detailed monitoring data.
(4) In order to ensure clarity and precision in the monitoring and reporting by Member States, it is also necessary to ensure consistency between the different requirements specified in Annex II to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011. The detailed data requirements are specified in the reporting formats set out in Part C of Annex II. Parts A and B of that Annex should therefore be adjusted to reflect those detailed data requirements accurately.

Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 19 November 1998, an anti-dumping proceeding was initiated by the Commission(2) on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel (""the product concerned"") originating, inter alia, in Ukraine.
(2) This proceeding resulted in an anti-dumping duty being imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 348/2000(3) in February 2000 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
(3) In parallel, by Decision 2000/137/EC(4), the Commission accepted a joint price undertaking up to a certain volume threshold incorporating measures aimed at monitoring the undertaking from three Ukrainian exporting producers, Dnepropetrovsk Tube Works (""DTW""), Nikopol Pivdennotrubny Works (transferred later to Nikopolsky Seamless Tube Plant, ""Niko Tube""(5)) and Nizhnedneprovsky Tube Rolling Plant (""NTRP""). Accordingly, imports of the product concerned from these exporting producers were exempted from the said anti-dumping duty.
B. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF THE JOINT UNDERTAKING
(4) DTW, Niko Tube and NTRP advised the Commission that they wished to withdraw this joint undertaking. Accordingly, by Commission Decision 2002/669/EC(6), the names of these companies have been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in Article 1 of Decision 2000/137/EC.
C. AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 348/2000
(5) In view of the above and pursuant to Article 8(9) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96, Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 should be amended accordingly, and the exporting producers should be subject to the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty for the Ukraine as set in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 (38,5 %),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1515/2002 of 16 August 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain seamless pipes and tubes of iron or non-alloy steel originating in Croatia and Ukraine', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe table in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 348/2000 shall be replaced by the following table:\n\n"">TABLE>""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 August 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nP.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) NÂ° 3731/90
of 13 December 1990
opening,  allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for prepared or  preserved sardines, originating in Morocco (1991)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article  113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 4 of Protocol 1 to the Agreement on relations in the sea fisheries sector between  the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (1) states that prepared or preserved  sardines falling within CN code ex 1604 13 10 or ex 1604 20 50 and originating in Morocco shall be  imported duty-free into the Community within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 17 500  tonnes (net weight); whereas, in order to ensure a regular flow to the Community market under this  quota, the quantities destined for that market may not exceed 60 % of the total volume of the quota  in the first half of the year and may not exceed 35 % in the first quarter of the year; whereas at  the end of each of these periods the quantities of the products in question which have been  allocated to the Member States and remain unused by the latter should be returned immediately to  the Community reserve;
Whereas, within the limits of the tariff quota, Spain and Portugal shall apply the customs duties  calculated according to the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988  laying down the arrangements to be applied by Spain and Portugal to trade with Morocco (2); whereas  the Community tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for 1991;
Whereas equal and continous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and  the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in  question into all the Member States until the quota is exhausted;
Whereas the prepared and preserved sardines sector is encountering, in certain regions of the  Community, economic constraints of a particular nature, bearing in mind notably the importance  which sardine production may have in the fisheries production structure as a whole, thus justifying  the fact that the traditional commercial outlets for producers on external markets and, as a matter  of priority, on the Community market, should not be adversely affected;
whereas these specific economic circumstances make it necessary to maintain the allocation between  the Member States of the quota concerned for the period af application of this Regulation;
Whereas, bearing in mind the way in which trade has developed traditionally, the allocation  maintained among Member States should, in order to correspond as closely as possible to the real  trend of the market for the products in question, be carried out on a pro rata basis according to  the needs of the Member States, calculated on the basis of statistics of imports of the said  products from Morocco during a representative reference period and on the economic outlook for the  quota periods in question;
Whereas in the last three years the products in question were imported regularly only by certain  Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, in these  circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be allocated to the genuine importing  Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the tariff quota when  imports actually take place; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the  uniform collection of the duties applicable;
Whereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States,  the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member  States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States which  have used up their initial shares and any requirements which might arise in the other Member  States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, an appropriate  level for the first part of the Community quota would, in the present circumstances, be 40 % of the  quota volume, the second part, 60 % constituting the reserve to which shall also be returned any  amounts remaining from the shares allocated when the quota volume was divided up for the first and  second quarters of the current year;
Whereas the initial shares may be used up at different rates in each of the periods concerned;  whereas, to provide for this eventuality and to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies, any  Member State which has entirely used up its initial share should draw additional shares in  quantities corresponding to the period in question; whereas each Member State should effect its  drawing whenever each of its additional shares is almost used up, and as many times as the reserve  for that period allows; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between  Member States and the Commission and the latter must be able to
monitor the extent to which the  quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if, during one of the periods concerned, the Community reserve is almost completely used  up, it is essential that Member States return to the reserve the whole of the unused part of their  initial shares and any drawings for that period, in order to prevent part of the Community tariff  quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation  concerning the administration of the
quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried  out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3731/90 of 13 December 1990 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for prepared or preserved sardines, originating in Morocco (1991)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1991 the  customs duty applicable to imports into the Community of the following products, originating in  Morocco, shall be suspended at the level indicated and within the limits of a Community tariff  quota as shown below:\n\n>TABLE>\n\nWithin the limits of this tariff quota, the Kingdom of\n\nSpain and the Portuguese  Republic shall apply customs\n\nduties calculated in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas, on 30 April 1987, the Greek Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet, hereinafter referred to as 'the programme'; whereas it forwarded at a later date additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the programme fulfills the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources was introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 (2);
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 is aimed at facilitating the structural development of the fisheries sector within the framework of the guidelines of the common fisheries policy; whereas such structural development may be encouraged by appropriate measures supported with Community financial aid;
Whereas such measures should help to create a fishing fleet that is adapted to likely medium-term catch opportunities in both Community and non-Community waters; whereas these measures should, in particular, be based on an attempt to ensure balanced exploitation of internal resources in Community waters;
Whereas the measures implemented under the Community rules adopted for the decade from 1987 to 1997 are a continuation of the efforts made since 1983 to improve the structural situation up to 31 December 1986 through common measures to restructure, modernize and develop the fisheries sector; whereas, therefore, the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decision 85/283/EEC (3) constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the effort still needed to ensure that the Community objectives are achieved;
Whereas the objectives of the guidance programme for 1986 have not been fully achieved; whereas the current or likely situation as regards availabilities in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned do not allow for any adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved; whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1987 to 1991;
Whereas these forecasts could be reviewed were there to be any significant change in availabilities, backed up by scientific evidence, and in the light of the development of international fishery relations between the Community and coastal third States;
Whereas, in addition, the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme period between fishing capacities and availabilities;
Whereas the desired structural adjustments should be implemented on a gradual and continuing basis to reduce the economic and social impact they may have to a minimum;
Whereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken under this programme may not warrant public financial assistance; whereas, in this context, approval of the programme should only be effective where the limitations and conditions upon which such approval was made conditional are complied with;

The overall objective referred to in point II (1) (a) above may only be revised on the basis of detailed scientific assessments which show the existence of stocks which are not fully exploited at present.\n\n2. It is imperative that the redeployment of fishing activities referred to in point II (1) (c) above be accompanied by rules to ensure that fishing activities in waters traditionally fished by the 'inshore fleet' are curtailed.\n\n3. Any increase in unit mean tonnage of Mediterranean fishing vessels should be accompanied by an equivalent definitive withdrawal of obsolete vessels.\n\n4. Oceanic boats not active at present cannot be taken into account within the framework of the present programme except as an exchange for a reduction of the oceanic fleet which is active at present.\n\n5. The objectives of the programme should be realized at the 20 % level at least by the end of 1988 and by 80 % at least by the end of 1990.\n\n6. The Commission recalls that any financial measures taken by national, regional or local authorities in respect of the sector concerned must henceforth lie within the scope of this programme.""}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;

Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament;
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee;
Whereas the provisions in force in the Member States designed to ensure safety in the use of electrical equipment used within certain voltage limits may differ, thus impeding trade;
Whereas in certain Member States in respect of certain electrical equipment, the safety legislation takes the form of preventive and repressive measures by means of binding provisions;
Whereas in other Member States in order to achieve the same objective, the safety legislation provides for reference to technical standards laid down by Standards Bodies ; whereas such a system offers the advantage of rapid adjustment to technical progress without neglecting safety requirements;
Whereas certain Member States carry out administrative operations to approve standards ; whereas such approval neither affects the technical content of the standards in any way nor limits their conditions of use ; whereas such approval cannot therefore alter the effects, from a Community point of view, of harmonized and published standards;
Whereas within the Community the free movement of electrical equipment should follow when this equipment complies with certain safety requirements recognized in all Member States ; whereas without prejudice to any other form of proof, the proof of compliance with these requirements may be established by reference to harmonized standards which incorporate these conditions ; whereas these harmonized standards should be established by common agreement by bodies to be notified by each Member State to the other Member States and to the Commission and should be publicized as widely as possible ; whereas such harmonization should for the purposes of trade eliminate the inconveniences, resulting from differences between national standards;
Whereas, without prejudice to any other form of proof, the compliance of electrical equipment with the harmonized standards may be presumed from the affixing or issue of marks or certificates by the competent organizations or, in the absence thereof, from a manufacturer's declaration of compliance ; whereas in order to facilitate the removal of barriers to trade the Member States should recognize such marks or certificates or such declaration as elements of proof ; whereas, with this end in view, the said  marks or certificates should be publicized in particular by their publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities;
Whereas as a transitional measure, the free movement of electrical equipment for which harmonized standards do not yet exist may be achieved by applying the safety provisions or standards already laid down by other international bodies or by one of the bodies which establish harmonized standards;
Whereas it is possible that electrical equipment may be placed in free circulation even though it does not comply with the safety requirements, and whereas it is therefore desirable to lay down suitable provisions to minimize this danger;","{'title': 'Council Directive 73/23/EEC of 19 February 1973 on the harmonization of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive ""electrical equipment"" means any equipment designed for use with a voltage rating of between 50 and 1 000 v for alternating current and between 75 and 1 500 v for direct current, other than the equipment and phenomena listed in Annex II.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Directive 97/41/EC(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/71/EC(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(5), as last amended by Directive 1999/71/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables(6), as last amended by Directive 1999/71/EC, and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For cereals and products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables, maximum residue levels reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in view of the protection of the environment and in terms of estimated dietary intake. For foodstuffs of animal origin, maximum residue levels reflect the consumption of cereals and products of plant origin treated with pesticides resulting in residues in animals and animal products, as well as taking into account the direct consequences of the use of veterinary medicines where appropriate.
(2) Maximum residue levels are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.
(3) Maximum residue levels for pesticides should be kept under review. The levels may be changed to take account of new information and data.
(4) Aramite, barban, chlorobenzilate, chlorfenson, chloroxuron, chlorbenside, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-ethyl-phenyl-) ethane and diallate are either no longer authorised for use in the Community or are no longer used at Community level. The aramite and chlorfenson residues were deleted from Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC by Council Directive 82/528/EEC(7) but have not since that time been added to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. The chlorbenside and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis (4-ethyl-phenyl-) ethane residues were deleted from Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC by Council Directive 93/58/EEC(8) but have not since that time been added to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. It is necessary to add all of these residues to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(5) Limited authorisations still exist in the Community for chlorbufam and methoxychlor. The authorised uses would not be expected to give rise to detectable residues in food. Maximum residue levels have been fixed in Annex II to Directive 76/895/EEC for these residues.
(6) To establish maximum levels of pesticide residues for barban, chlorbufam, chlorobenzilate, chloroxuron, diallate and methoxychlor at Community level it is necessary to transfer provisions from Directive 76/895/EEC to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. Certain of these provisions should be amended in the light of technical and scientific progress as well as changes in uses and authorisations at national and Community level.
(7) Community maximum residue levels and levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. With the exception of chlorobenzilate, no Codex maximum residue limits were set for the active substances covered by this Directive. The Codex maximum residue limits for chlorobenzilate have been withdrawn(9). Authorisations of plant protection products in third countries may require the use of greater quantities of pesticides or shorter pre-harvest intervals than are authorised in the Community and consequently may require higher residue levels. The Community's trading partners have been consulted about the levels set out in this Directive through the World Trade Organisation and their comments on these levels have been considered and discussed by the Standing Committee on Plant Health. The possibility of fixing import tolerance maximum residue levels for specific pesticide/crop combinations will be examined by the European Community on the basis of the submission of acceptable data.
(8) The maximum residue levels established in this Directive may have to be reviewed in the framework of the re-evaluation of active substances provided for in the programme of work established in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(10), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/80/EC(11).
(9) The maximum residue level for cartap in tea was set at 20 mg/kg in Community legislation on the basis of the information contained in the Codex Alimentarius. The 29th meeting of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues recommended that all MRLs for the active substance be withdrawn(12).
(10) A lack of clarity in the description of CN codes in Annexes I and II to Directive 86/363/EEC has led to problems in classifying samples for the purposes of the notification procedure under Article 7 of Directive 86/363/EEC.
(11) DDT is not authorised for use as a plant protection product in the Community.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 3 (3) thereof,
Whereas information shows that the application of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Chapter IV of the Annex to Directive 93/43/EEC relating to the transport of bulk foodstuffs in liquid, granulate or powdered form in receptacles and/or containers/tankers reserved for the transport of foodstuffs, is not practical and imposes an unduly onerous burden on food business when applied to the transport in sea-going vessels of liquid oils and fats intended for, or likely to be used for, human consumption;
Whereas, however, it is necessary to ensure that the granting of a derogation provides equivalent protection to public health, by attaching conditions to the terms of such derogation;
Whereas the availability of sea-going vessels reserved for the transport of foodstuffs is insufficient to serve the continuing trade in oils and fats intended for or likely to be used for human consumption;
Whereas experience acquired during the past years has shown that contamination of liquid oils and fats can be avoided where tanks used for their transport are made of readily cleansible materials or where the three previous cargoes are of such a nature that they do not leave unacceptable contamination; whereas on the other hand it should be established that tanks that have been used previously for transportation have been effectively cleaned;
Whereas it is incumbent on Member States by virtue of Article 8 of Directive 93/43/EEC to carry out controls to ensure the application of this Directive;
Whereas this specific derogation should be without prejudice to the general provisions of Directive 93/43/EEC;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 1 (2) of Directive 93/43/EEC, this derogation should not concern foods to which more specific Community hygiene rules apply;

After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2003/17/EC of 16 December 2002 on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed produced in third countries (3) provides that, for a limited period, field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops of certain species are to be considered to be equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union legal acts, and that seed of certain species produced in third countries is to be considered to be equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union legal acts.
(2) It appears that field inspections carried out in third countries continue to afford the same guarantees as field inspections carried out by Member States. They should therefore continue to be considered to be equivalent.
(3) As Decision 2003/17/EC will expire on 31 December 2012, the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision should be extended. It appears desirable to extend that period by 10 years.
(4) The reference to Yugoslavia in Decision 2003/17/EC should be deleted. Serbia, as a member of the OECD Schemes for the Varietal Certification of Seed Moving in International Trade and as a member of the International Seed Testing Association as regards the seed sampling and testing, should be added to the list of third countries in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC. In addition, the names of some authorities responsible for the approval and control of the production, as listed in Annex I to Decision 2003/17/EC, have changed.
(5) The provisions of Decision 2003/17/EC which refer to Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (4) should be deleted as, in the context of this Decision, their application would be incompatible with the system on delegated and implementing powers introduced by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty.

(1) Directive 2006/88/EC lays down the animal health requirements to be applied for the placing on the market and the import and the transit through the Union of aquaculture animals and products thereof.
(2) Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 (2) establishes a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments, from which it is permitted to introduce aquaculture animals.
(3) In addition, the model animal health certificates set out in Parts A and B of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 contain animal health attestations with regard to the requirements for species susceptible to certain diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC.
(4) Certain provinces of Canada (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut) are currently listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008. Imports of fish species susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, as set out in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, from those provinces into the Union are therefore permitted.
(5) Canada has requested that the province of Quebec should be added to the list set out in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008. According to the conclusions of an audit carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office in Canada in June 2012 concerning aquatic animal health, the competent authority of that third country can provide appropriate guarantees in relation to surveillance and monitoring of fish diseases, and a reliable certification system is in place for exports of fish and products thereof to the Union. In addition, the competent authority of Canada has submitted to the Commission detailed information with regard to a risk-based surveillance programme concerning viral haemorrhagic septicaemia carried out between 2007 and 2012 on wild fish originating from higher risk watersheds in the province of Quebec. From an analysis of the design and implementation of the surveillance programme it can be concluded that it is highly unlikely that the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus circulated in susceptible wild fish populations in Quebec during those years. That provides further assurances in respect of the health status of fish species susceptible to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia, or products thereof, that may be exported to the Union from Quebec.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period (1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period (2), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the Multi-Annual Financing Agreement between the Commission of the European Communities, acting on behalf of the European Community, and Hungary which was concluded on 15 June 2001, and in particular Article 12, Section A of the Annex thereto,
After consulting the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1419/2004 (3) provides for the continuation of the application of the Multiannual Financing Agreements and the Annual Financing Agreement concluded between the European Commission, representing the European Union on the one hand, and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia on the other, and for certain derogations from the Multiannual Financing Agreements (hereinafter referred to as ‘MAFAs’) and from Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 (4) and Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 447/2004 (5) lays down rules to facilitate the transition from support under Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 to that provided for by Council Regulations (EC) No 1257/1999 (6) and (EC) No 1260/1999 (7) for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, in conjunction with the MAFAs as referred to in Annex I, point 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1419/2004, and, in Article 12 of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 248/2007 (8) provides for measures concerning the MAFAs and the Annual Financing Agreements concluded under the Sapard programme and the transition from Sapard to rural development, in conjunction with the MAFAs as referred to in Annex III to that Regulation.
(4) Article 12(1) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, which remains in force after the accession of Hungary to the European Union by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 248/2007, requires the Commission to take a Decision (hereinafter referred to as ‘the conformity clearance Decision’) on the expenditure to be excluded from EU co-financing where it finds that expenditure has not been effected in compliance with this Agreement.
(5) The findings of the annual certification report for the Sapard accounts for the financial year 2004 indicated that the Sapard Agency might have breached certain provisions of the MAFAs. In this respect, the Commission launched an enquiry in accordance with the Article 12 of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs.
(6) In accordance with Article 12(3) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, the Hungarian authorities were invited to a bilateral discussion on 8 November 2005, at which both parties endeavoured to reach an agreement as to the action to be taken and on an evaluation of the gravity of the infringement.
(7) Following the bilateral discussion, the Commission still considered that certain items of expenditure had not been carried out in conformity with the rules governing the Sapard programme. For some of the payments made in the financial years 2003 and 2004, Hungary breached the 3-month deadline for payments to beneficiaries provided in Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs. According to this provision, the interval between receipt of the supporting documents needed to make the payment and issuing of the payment order should not have exceeded 3 months.
(8) By letter of 16 October 2009, the Hungarian authorities initiated a conciliation procedure in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 12(3) of Section A and Item 9 of Section F of the Annex to the MAFAs. The Conciliation Body supported the arguments presented by the Hungarian authorities and considered them as exceptional circumstances to derogate from the deadline for the payments to beneficiaries given by provision of Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs.
(9) The Commission could not consider the arguments given by the Hungarian authorities as exceptional circumstances, justifying some derogation from Article 8(6), Section A of the MAFAs, and proposed the amount of EUR 2 535 286 for financial reduction.
(10) In accordance with Article 12(7) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, the amount to be recovered shall be communicated to the National Authorising Officer who should, on behalf of Hungary, ensure that the amount is credited to the Sapard euro account within 2 months of the date that the Decision is taken. However, due to the fact that the implementation of the Sapard programme is finalised, the recovery of the sum excluded shall be executed in a form of a recovery order,","{'header': '29.3.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 81/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 28 March 2011\nexcluding from EU financing certain expenditure incurred by Hungary under the programme for the support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development (Sapard) in 2004\n(notified under document C(2011) 1738)\n(Only the Hungarian text is authentic)\n(2011/192/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1419/2004(3)provides for the continuation of the application of the Multiannual Financing Agreements and the Annual Financing Agreement concluded between the European Commission, representing the European Union on the one hand, and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia on the other, and for certain derogations from the Multiannual Financing Agreements (hereinafter referred to as ‘MAFAs’) and from Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999(4)and Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 447/2004(5)lays down rules to facilitate the transition from support under Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 to that provided for by Council Regulations (EC) No 1257/1999(6)and (EC) No 1260/1999(7)for the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, in conjunction with the MAFAs as referred to in Annex I, point 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1419/2004, and, in Article 12 of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs.\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 248/2007(8)provides for measures concerning the MAFAs and the Annual Financing Agreements concluded under the Sapard programme and the transition from Sapard to rural development, in conjunction with the MAFAs as referred to in Annex III to that Regulation.\n\n((4)) Article 12(1) of Section A of the Annex to the MAFAs, which remains in force after the accession of Hungary to the European Union by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 248/2007, requires the Commission to take a Decision (hereinafter referred to as ‘the conformity clearance Decision’) on the expenditure to be excluded from EU co-financing where it finds that expenditure has not been effected in compliance with this Agreement.\n\n((5)) The findings of the annual certification report for the Sapard accounts for the financial year 2004 indicated that the Sapard Agency might have breached certain provisions of the MAFAs.

Whereas, under Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas cucumbers are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas cucumbers harvested during a given crop year are marketed from January to December;
Whereas the quantities harvested during January and the first 10 days of February and during the last 20 days of November and December are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for all the year; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 11 February up to and including 10 November;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first stage of accession;
Whereas Community-produced cucumbers are grown mainly under glass; whereas the reference prices for the marketing year must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas cucumbers imported from certain third countries during the same period will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such cucumbers may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for cucumbers not grown under glass should therefore be adjusted by a conversion factor;

The Commission may jointly with Portugal call in an independent assessor who shall, on the  basis of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3. He may submit  proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or measures, modification of the selection  criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of  implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the  administrative measures to be taken. To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will  not pay the entire cost of employing him.\n\nIII.  Retrospective assessment of economic and phytosanitary impact The final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement  of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the  immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\n\nC.  Information and publicity In the framework of this programme, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall  ensure that it is adequately publicized.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n-  make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered  under the programme measures,\n\n-  make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\n\nPortugal and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives  envisaged in this area, possibly through the Monitoring Committee. They shall regularly notify the  Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the  Monitoring Committee.\n\nII. COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES\n\nCommunity policies applying in this  field must be complied with.\n\nThe programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and  compliance with Community policies.

on the approval of the Daimler AG efficient exterior lighting using light emitting diodes as an innovative technology for reducing CO2 emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emissions performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular Article 12(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The manufacturer Daimler AG (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of efficient exterior lighting with the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as an innovative technology package on 14 November 2013. The completeness of the application was assessed in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 (2). The Commission identified certain relevant information as missing in the original application and requested the Applicant to complete it. The Applicant provided the required information on 14 May 2014. The application was found to be complete and the period for the Commission's assessment of the application started on the day following the date of official receipt of the complete information, i.e. 15 May 2014.
(2) The application has been assessed in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 and the Technical Guidelines for the preparation of applications for the approval of innovative technologies pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (the Technical Guidelines) (3).
(3) The application refers to efficient exterior lighting with the use of light emitting diodes in the low beam headlamp, the high beam headlamp, the front position, and the licence plate. This technology package is similar to the innovative technologies approved as an eco-innovation in Commission Implementing Decisions 2013/128/EU (4) and 2014/128/EU (5). It should also be noted that the application by Daimler AG is based on the simplified approach described in the Technical Guidelines as the application previously approved by Implementing Decision 2014/128/EU, whereas the application approved by Implementing Decision 2013/128/EU was based on the comprehensive approach.
(4) The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.
(5) The Applicant has demonstrated that the use of the LEDs in the low beam headlamp, the high beam headlamp, the front position, and the licence plate did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009. In support of this the Applicant has referred to the Technical Guidelines, which provides for the summary of the CLEPA LIGHT Sight Safety report. The Applicant has used predefined functions and averaged data in line with the simplified approach specified in the Technical Guidelines.
(6) The Applicant has in accordance with the simplified approach described in the Technical Guidelines used halogen lighting as baseline technology for demonstrating the CO2 reducing capacity of the efficient exterior lighting with the use of light emitting diodes in the low beam headlamp, the high beam headlamp, the front position, and the licence plate.
(7) The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO2 reductions which includes formulae that are consistent with the formulae described in the Technical Guidelines for the simplified approach with regard to lighting functions. Considering that the Applicant has applied for an innovative technology package of efficient exterior lighting with the use of LEDs, the Commission finds it appropriate to modify the formulae for the calculation of CO2 savings to reflect the total CO2 savings of the lighting package. As a consequence, the methodology specified in the Annex to the decision differs in some essential elements from that approved by Implementing Decision 2014/128/EU. The Commission considers that the testing methodology will provide testing results that are verifiable, repeatable and comparable and that it is capable of demonstrating in a realistic manner the CO2 emissions benefits of the innovative technology with strong statistical significance in accordance with Article 6 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.
(8) Against that background the Commission finds that the Applicant has demonstrated satisfactorily that the emission reduction achieved by the innovative technology is at least 1 g CO2/km.
(9) Since the activation of the exterior lighting is not required for the CO2 emissions type approval test referred to in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (7), the Commission is satisfied that the lighting functions in question are not covered by the standard test cycle.
(10) The activation of the lighting functions concerned is mandatory to ensure the safe operation of the vehicle and as a consequence not dependant on the choice of the driver. On that basis the Commission finds that the manufacturer should be considered accountable for the CO2 emission reduction due to the use of the LEDs.
(11) The Commission finds that the verification report has been prepared by TÜV NORD Mobilität GmbH & Co. KG which is an independent and certified body and that the report supports the findings set out in the application.
(12) Against that background, the Commission finds that no objections should be raised as regards the approval of the innovative technology in question.
(13) Any manufacturer wishing to benefit from a reduction of its average specific CO2 emissions for the purpose of meeting its specific emissions target by means of the CO2 savings from the use of the innovative technology approved by this Decision, should in accordance with Article 11(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011, refer to this Decision in its application for an EC type-approval certificate for the vehicles concerned.
(14) For the purposes of determining the general eco-innovation code to be used in the relevant type approval documents in accordance with Annexes I, VIII and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), the individual code to be used for the innovative technology approved through this Decision should be specified.
(15) The period for the assessment of the innovative technology referred to in Article 10(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 is due to expire. It is therefore appropriate that the Decision enters into force as soon as possible,","{'header': '10.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 33/52', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2015/206\nof 9 February 2015\non the approval of the Daimler AG efficient exterior lighting using light emitting diodes as an innovative technology for reducing CO2emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The manufacturer Daimler AG (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of efficient exterior lighting with the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) as an innovative technology package on 14 November 2013.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2005/767/EC (2) authorises France to apply, for a period of 3 years, differentiated levels of taxation to gas oil and unleaded petrol. France had requested the authorisation in the context of an administrative reform involving the decentralisation of certain specific powers previously exercised by central government. Decision 2005/767/EC expired on 31 December 2009.
(2) By letter dated 12 August 2009, France requested authorisation to continue to apply differentiated rates of taxation under the same conditions for a further 6 years after 31 December 2009.
(3) Decision 2005/767/EC was adopted on the basis that the measure requested by France met the requirements set out in Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC. In particular, it was considered that that measure would not hinder the proper functioning of the internal market. It was also considered that it was in conformity with the relevant Community policies.
(4) The national measure is part of a policy designed to increase administrative effectiveness by improving the quality and reducing the cost of public services, as well as a policy of subsidiarity. It offers regions an additional incentive to improve the quality of their administration in a transparent fashion. In this respect, Decision 2005/767/EC requires that the reductions be linked to the socioeconomic circumstances of the regions in which they are applied. Overall, the national measure is based on specific policy considerations.
(5) The tight limits set for the differentiation of rates on a regional basis as well as the exclusion of gas oil used for commercial purposes from the measure imply that the risk of competitive distortions in the internal market is very low. Moreover, the application of the measure so far has shown a strong tendency on behalf of regions to levy the maximum rate allowable, which has further decreased any potential for competitive distortions.
(6) No obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market have been reported as regards, more particularly, the circulation of the products in question in their capacity as products subject to excise duty.
(7) When originally requested, the national measure had been preceded by a tax increase equal to the margin for regional reductions. Against this background and in light of the conditions of the authorisation as well as experience gathered, the national measure does not, at this stage, appear to be in conflict with Union energy and climate policies.
(8) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that Article must be strictly limited in time. Due to the possible future developments of the Union framework on energy taxation, this authorisation should be limited to a period of 3 years.

""Alternative tests"" indicated in Chapter IV are permissible instead of migration tests with fatty food simulant when the conditions specified in Chapter IV are fulfilled.\n\n4. In all three cases it is permissible:\n\n(a) to reduce the number of tests to be carried out to that or those which, in the specific case under examination, is (are) generally recognized to be the most severe on the basis of scientific evidence;\n\n(b) to omit the migration or the substitute or the alternative tests where there is conclusive proof that the migration limits cannot be exceeded in any foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFood simulants\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAs it is not possible always to use foodstuffs for testing food contact materials, food simulants are introduced. They are classified by convention as having the character of one or more food types. The food types and the food simulants to be used are indicated in Table 1. In practice various mixtures of food types are possible, for instance fatty and aqueous foods. They are described in Table 2 accompanied by the indication of the food simulant(s) to be selected in carrying out the migration tests.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n2. Selection of food simulants\n\n2.1. Materials and articles intended for contact with all food types\n\nThe tests shall be carried out using the food simulants mentioned below, which are considered the more severe, at the test conditions specified in Chapter II, taking a new test specimen of the plastic material or article for each simulant:\n\n- 3 % acetic acid (w/v) in aqueous solution,\n\n- 10 % ethanol (v/v) in aqueous solution,\n\n- rectified olive oil (""reference simulant D"").\n\nHowever this reference simulant D may be replaced by a synthetic mixture of triglycerides or sunflower oil or corn oil with standardized specifications (""Other fatty food simulants"", called ""simulants D""). If, when using any of these other fatty food simulants, the migration limits are exceeded, for the judgement of non compliance a confirmation of the result by using olive oil is obligatory, when technically feasible. If this information is not technically feasible and the material or article exceeds the migration limits it shall be deemed not in compliance with the Directive 90/128/EEC.\n\n2.2. Materials and articles intended for contact with specific food types\n\nThis case refers only to the following situations:\n\n(a) when the material or article is already in contact with a known foodstuff;\n\n(b) when the material or article is accompanied, according to the rules of Article 6 of Directive 89/109/EEC, by a specific indication stating with which food types described in Table 1 it may or may not be used, for example ""only for aqueous foods"";\n\n(c) when the material or article is accompanied, according to the rules of Article 6 of Directive 89/109/EEC, by a specific indication stating with which foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs mentioned in Directive 85/572/EEC they may or may not be used. This indication shall be expressed:\n\n(i) at the marketing stages other than retail stage, by using the ""reference number"" or ""description of foodstuffs"" provided in the Table of Directive 85/572/EEC;\n\n(ii) at the retail stage using an indication which shall refer to only a few foods or groups of food, preferably with examples which are easy to understand.\n\nIn these situations the tests shall be carried out using for the case under (b) the food simulant(s) indicated as examples in Table 2 and for the case under (a) and (c) the food(s) simulant(s) mentioned in Directive 85/572/EEC. Where the foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs is (are) not included in the list specified in Directive 85/572/EEC, select the item from Table 2 which corresponds most closely to the foodstuff(s) or group(s) of foodstuffs under examination.\n\nIf the material or article is intended to come into contact with more than one foodstuff or group(s) of foodstuffs having different reduction factors, for each foodstuff apply the appropriate reduction factors to the test result. If one or more results of such calculation exceed the restriction, then the material is not suitable for that particular foodstuff or group(s) of foodstuff.\n\nThe tests shall be carried out at the test conditions specified in Chapter II, taking a new test specimen for each simulant.\n\n>TABLE>\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nMigration test conditions (times and temperatures)\n\n1. The migration tests are to be carried out, selecting from the times and temperatures specified in Table 3 those which correspond to the worst foreseeable conditions of contact for the plastic material or article being studied and to any labelling information on maximum temperature for use. Therefore if the plastic material or article is intended for a food contact application covered by a combination of two or more times and temperatures taken from the table, the migration test shall be carried out subjecting the test specimen successively to all the applicable worst foreseeable conditions appropriate to the sample, using the same portion of food simulant.\n\n2. Contact conditions generally recognized as more severe\n\nIn application of the general criteria that the determination of migration should be restricted to the test conditions which, in the specific case under examination, are recognized to be the most severe on the basis of scientific evidence, some specific examples for the test contact conditions are given below.\n\n2.1. Plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs at any condition of time and temperature\n\nWhere no labelling or instructions are given to indicate contact temperature and time expected in actual use, depending on food type(s), simulant(s) A and/or B and/or C shall be used for 4 hours at 100 °C or for 4 hours at reflux temperature and/or simulant D shall be used only for 2 hours at 175 °C. These conditions of time and temperature are conventionally considered to be the more severe.\n\n2.2. Plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs at room temperature or below for an unspecified period\n\nWhere the materials and articles are labelled for use at room temperature or below or where the materials and articles by their nature are clearly intended for use at room temperature and below, the test shall be carried out at 40 °C for 10 days. These conditions of time and temperature are conventionally considered to be the more severe.\n\n3. Volatile migrants\n\nWhen testing for the specific migration of volatile substances, the test(s) with simulant(s) shall be performed in a manner which recognizes the loss of volatile migrants which may occur in the worst foreseeable conditions of use.\n\n4. Special cases\n\n4.1. For materials and articles intended for use in microwave ovens, migration testing may use either a conventional or a microwave oven provided the appropriate time and temperature conditions are selected from Table 3.\n\n4.2. If it is found that carrying out the tests under the contact conditions specified in Table 3 causes physical or other changes in the test specimen which do not occur under worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article under examination, the migration tests shall be carried out under the worst foreseeable conditions of use in which these physical or other changes do not take place.\n\n4.3. By derogation from the test conditions provided in Table 3 and in paragraph 2, if the plastic material or article may in actual use be employed for periods of less than 15 minutes at temperatures between 70 °C and 100 °C (e.g. ""hot fill"") and is so indicated by appropriate labelling or instructions, only the 2 hours test at 70 °C shall be carried out. However if the material or article is intended to be used also for storage at room temperature, the above-mentioned test is replaced by a test at 40 °C for 10 days conventionally considered more severe.\n\n4.4. In those instances where the conventional conditions for migration testing are not adequately covered by the test contact conditions of Table 3 (for instance contact temperatures greater than 175 °C or contact time less than 5 minutes), other contact conditions may be used which are more appropriate to the case under examination, provided that the selected conditions may represent the worst foreseeable conditions of contact for the plastic materials or articles being studied.\n\n>TABLE>\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nSubstitute fat test for overall and specific migration\n\n1. If the use of the fatty food simulants is not feasible for technical reasons connected with the method of analysis, use instead all test media prescribed in Table 4 under the test conditions corresponding to the test conditions for simulant D.\n\nThis table gives some examples of the most important conventional migration test conditions and their corresponding conventional conditions of the substitute tests. For other test conditions not stated in Table 4, take into account these examples as well as the existing experience for the type of polymer under examination.\n\nUse for each test a new test specimen. Apply for each test medium the same rules prescribed in Chapters I and II for simulant D. Use, where appropriate, the reduction factors established in Directive 85/572/EEC. To ascertain compliance with any migration limit, select the highest value obtained using all the test media.\n\nHowever if it is found that carrying out these tests causes physical or other changes in the test specimen which do not occur under the worst foreseeable conditions of use of the material or article under examination, the result for this test media shall be discarded and the highest of the remaining values shall be chosen.\n\n2. By derogation of point 1, it may be possible to omit one or two of the substitute tests provided in Table 4, if these tests are generally recognized as not appropriate for the sample under consideration on the basis of scientific evidence.\n\n>TABLE>\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAlternative fat tests for overall and specific migration\n\n1. It is permissible to use the result of alternative tests as specified in this Chapter provided that both the following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n(a) the results obtained in a ""comparison test"" show that the values are equal to or greater than those obtained in the test with simulant D;\n\n(b) the migration in alternative test does not exceed the migration limits, after application of appropriate reduction factors provided in Directive 85/572/EEC.\n\nIf either or both conditions are not fulfilled, then the migration tests must be performed.\n\n2. By derogation of the condition previously mentioned in paragraph 1 (a), it is possible to omit the comparison test if there is other conclusive proof based on scientific experimental results that the values obtained in the alternative test are equal to or greater than those obtained in the migration test.\n\n3. Alternative tests\n\n3.1. Alternative tests with volatile media\n\nThese tests use volatile media such as isooctane or ethanol 95 % or other volatile solvents or mixture of solvents. They shall be carried out at the contact conditions such that the condition under 1 (a) is fulfilled.\n\n3.2. ""Extraction tests""\n\nOther tests, which use media having a very strong extraction power under very severe test conditions, may be used if it is generally recognized, on the basis of scientific evidence, that the results obtained using these tests (""extraction tests"") are equal to or higher than those obtained in the test with simulant D.`'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 22 June 2005, Dow AgroSciences Europe submitted to the competent authority of the Netherlands an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton (‘the application’).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton for the same uses as any other cotton with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC. It also includes a monitoring plan for environmental effects conforming with Annex VII to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 15 June 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (‘EFSA’) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. It considered that cotton 281-24-236x3006-210-23 is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health or the environment. Therefore it concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton as described in the application (‘the products’) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of their intended uses (3).
(4) In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products. However, due to the physical characteristics of cotton seeds and methods of its transportation, EFSA recommended that, within general surveillance, specific measures are introduced to actively monitor the occurrence of feral cotton plants in areas where seed spillage and plant establishment are likely to occur.
(6) In order to better describe the monitoring requirements and to comply with the EFSA recommendation, the monitoring plan submitted by the applicant has been modified. Specific measures to limit losses and spillage and to eradicate adventitious cotton populations have been introduced.
(7) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(8) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(9) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down in Article 4(6) labelling requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(11) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6). The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(12) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(13) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing-House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (7).
(14) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(15) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chair and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures.
(16) Since, at its meeting on 15 December 2011, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal and the Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded, these measures are to be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '28.12.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 344/51', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 December 2011\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified cotton 281-24-236x3006-210-23 (DAS-24236-5xDAS-21Ø23-5) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2011) 9532)\n(Only the English text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/891/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 22 June 2005, Dow AgroSciences Europe submitted to the competent authority of the Netherlands an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton (‘the application’).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of products other than food and feed containing or consisting of 281-24-236x3006-210-23 cotton for the same uses as any other cotton with the exception of cultivation.

Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2699/2000(2) inter alia amended Title I of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96(3) and accordingly adjusted, without changing the content, the provisions governing the aid scheme for the processing of dried figs and prunes derived from d'Ente plums. The scheme, which was previously included in Articles 2 to 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96, is currently established by Article 6a of that Regulation. To take account of this new presentation, the text of Article 31 of the said Regulation, which identifies the expenditure to be funded by the Guarantee Section of the European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), should be amended.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2003/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2003 on occurrence reporting in civil aviation (1), and in particular Article 7(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/42/EC requires national occurrence reporting systems to be established, in order to ensure that relevant information on air safety is reported, collected, stored, protected and disseminated with the only objective of preventing accidents and incidents, excluding as a consequence the attribution of blame or liability.
(2) This Regulation should apply to information exchanged by Member States pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 2003/42/EC. Information concerning national occurrences, stored in the national databases, should be subject to national regulations governing the release of aviation safety information.
(3) Interested parties, for the purposes of this Regulation, should be defined as any person that is in a position to participate in the improvement of civil aviation safety by making good use of the safety related information collected under Directive 2003/42/EC.
(4) National points of contacts have the best knowledge of interested parties established in their own Member State. In order to deal with information requests in the safest and most efficient manner, each national point of contact should deal with requests from interested parties established in the territory of that Member State while requests from interested parties from third countries or from international organisations should be dealt with by the Commission.
(5) The Commission may decide at a later stage to entrust an entity with the management of exchanged information in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 2003/42/EC and to deal with requests from interested parties from third countries or from international organisations.
(6) A list of points of contacts should be established by the Commission and should be publicly available.
(7) In order to prevent abuse of the system, the contact point receiving a request for information should check that the requestor is an interested party and the request should be evaluated, before the amount and the level of information to be supplied is defined.
(8) The national points of contact should obtain enough information to proceed to validation and evaluation of requests. For that purpose they should use a form containing relevant information on the requestor and the intended purpose of the request.
(9) When certain interested parties regularly need information relating to their own activities, it should be possible to adopt a general decision to supply information in respect of those parties.
(10) A requestor should ensure that the confidentiality of the system is protected, and should limit the use of the information received to the purpose specified in the request, which should be compatible with the objectives of Directive 2003/42/EC.
(11) All points of contact should be able to monitor that a request they have turned down is not reintroduced through the authority of another Member State. They should also be able to take example from the best practices of other points of contact. They should therefore have access to the records of the requests for information and decisions adopted in respect of such requests.
(12) Modern technology should be used for the transfer of data, while at the same time ensuring the protection of the entire database.
(13) In order to enable the Commission to prepare the appropriate measures for exchange of information between Member States and the Commission, as required by Article 6.4 of Directive 2003/42/EC, this Regulation shall apply six months after its entry into force.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Opinion of the Air Safety Committee established by Article 12 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation (2),","{'header': '14.11.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 295/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1330/2007\nof 24 September 2007\nlaying down implementing rules for the dissemination to interested parties of information on civil aviation occurrences referred to in Article 7(2) of Directive 2003/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2003/42/EC requires national occurrence reporting systems to be established, in order to ensure that relevant information on air safety is reported, collected, stored, protected and disseminated with the only objective of preventing accidents and incidents, excluding as a consequence the attribution of blame or liability.\n\n((2)) This Regulation should apply to information exchanged by Member States pursuant to Article 6(1) of Directive 2003/42/EC.

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Directive 74/63/EEC (4), as last amended by Commission Directive 87/238/EEC (5), expressly excludes pesticide residues from its field of application;
Whereas the presence of pesticide residues in feedingstuffs may, in the same way as the presence of residues of certain products and substances which are already subject to control, entail risks for human health, since in general toxic substances or preparations with dangerous effects are involved;
Whereas it is advisable to disregard the fact that pesticides - unlike most of the undesirable substances and products for which rules have hitherto been adopted - are used deliberately by man to protect plant products, since they are not added to feedingstuffs or to the components thereof; whereas, nevertheless, their possible presence constitutes a source of danger in the same way as that of the substances and products already covered by the said Directive 74/63/EEC;
Whereas, for this reason, pesticides should be used in such a way as not to involve any danger for human health;
Whereas, insofar as a few Member States have already laid down maximum permitted levels for certain pesticide residues, these levels differ and constitute obstacles to the free circulation of feedingstuffs within the Community; whereas it is therefore desirable to approximate the existing provisions by inserting them into the abovementioned Directive, which is the appropriate framework for this purpose;
Whereas, in an initial stage, it would appear justifiable to fix in respect of feedingstuffs maximum levels for a group of very persistent and harmful active substances which are or have been used in pesticides, namely organochlorine compounds; whereas Member States may therefore maintain the maximum levels they have fixed for residues of pesticides other than those listed in part B of Annex I until a Community decision is taken in accordance with the provisions laid down for amendment of the Annexes,","{'title': 'Council Directive 87/519/EEC of 19 October 1987 amending Directive 74/63/EEC on undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDirective 74/63/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 of 26 February 1985 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1821/87 (2), and in particular Articles 13a and 22 thereof,
Whereas Article 13a of Regulation (EEC) No 486/85 stipulates that products listed there, originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories, are subject on importation into the Community to progressively reduced rates of duty; whereas such reduction of duties applies only up to ceilings above which the customs duties actually applied in respect of third countries may be re-established;
Whereas, within the limits of these tariff ceilings, customs duties are reduced progressively by the percentages specified in that Article, during the same periods and in accordance with the same timetables as provided for in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic; whereas on this basis, the preferential duty rates applicable in 1988 and 1989 must be equal to 70 % and 60 %, respectively, of the basic rates, with the exception of Chinese cabbages and walnuts, for which the rates must be 72,7 % and 63,6 % respectively of the basic rates; whereas, however, the preferential duty applicable to walnuts is equivalent to a reduction of 40 % on the normal duty rate;
Whereas by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of Decision No 2/87 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on the advance implementation of the Protocol to the Third ACP-EEC Convention consequent on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities (3), Spain and Portugal are to postpone implementation of the preferential arrangements for fruit and vegetables falling within Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1117/88 (5), until 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990 respectively; whereas, consequently, the abovementioned tariff concession does not apply at present in Spain or Portugal;
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible re-establishment of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to re-establish customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1862/88 of 30 June 1988 establishing ceilings and Community surveillance for imports of certain products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States or in the overseas countries and territories (1988/89)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Greece received on 22 October 1999 an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH for the inclusion of the active substance acetamiprid in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2000/390/EC (2) confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) The United Kingdom received an application under Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC on 11 September 1998 from Bayer plc. (now Bayer CropScience AG) concerning thiacloprid. Commission Decision 2000/181/EC (3) confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For those active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicants. The designated rapporteur Member States submitted draft assessment reports concerning the substances to the Commission on 19 March 2001 (acetamiprid) and 22 November 2000 (thiacloprid).
(4) The draft assessment reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 29 June 2004 in the format of the Commission review reports for acetamiprid and thiacloprid.
(5) The review of acetamiprid and thiacloprid did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substances concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include acetamiprid and thiacloprid in Annex I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) After the inclusion of acetamiprid and thiacloprid in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement the provisions of that Directive as regards plant protection products containing those substances and in particular to review existing provisional authorisations and, by the end of this period at the latest, to transform those authorisations into full authorisations, to amend them or to withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '6.10.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 309/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2004/99/EC\nof 1 October 2004\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include acetamiprid and thiacloprid as active substances\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Greece received on 22 October 1999 an application from Nisso Chemical Europe GmbH for the inclusion of the active substance acetamiprid in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2), and in particular Article 11(8) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3482/92 (3) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of large electrolytic aluminium capacitors with a CV product (capacitance multiplied by rated voltage) between 18 000 and 310 000 micro-coulombs at a voltage of 160 V or more, and with a diameter of 19mm or more and a length of 20 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as LAECs) originating in Japan. The rate of definitive duty applicable to imports of the product manufactured by Rubycon Corporation, Ina Nagano (hereinafter referred to as Rubycon Japan) was set at 30,1 %. This was the level of duty in force in respect of the imports for which a refund is claimed.
(2) On 28 August 1996 Rubycon Japan submitted a request for an interim review (hereinafter referred to as the review) which was initiated on 17 December 1996 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (4). The Commission sought and verified all the information it considered necessary and made verification visits to the premises of Rubycon Japan and of its subsidiary in the United Kingdom, Rubycon UK within the framework of the review which covered the period from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996. The review was concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 2593/97 (5) which determined that the dumping margin of Rubycon Japan for the product concerned during the investigation period was 4,2 % and reduced the anti-dumping duty accordingly.
(3) On 28 August 1996 and 3 February 1997 Rubycon Japan's subsidiary in the United Kingdom (hereinafter referred to as the applicant) submitted applications for the refund of GBP [ . . . ] (6) (57 transactions in total). The refund claim corresponds to anti-dumping duties paid on imports of LAECs originating in Japan released for free circulation in the United Kingdom in the period from 26 February 1996 to 3 December 1996. The goods for which a refund is claimed were invoiced by Rubycon Japan between 19 January 1996 and 25 October 1996.
(4) The applicant received disclosure of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to adopt this Decision. The applicant made no comment.
(5) Since the merits of the refund applications which are within the scope of this Decision as defined in recital 7 are dependent in their entirety on the findings of the review, the applications should be considered to be duly substantiated by evidence within the meaning of the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the Basic Regulation) from the date on which the findings of the review were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, that is 23 December 1997.
B. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT
(6) The applicant claims that the dumping margin in respect of the LAECs released into free circulation in the Community during the period from 26 February 1996 to 3 December 1996 for which anti-dumping duties were paid was significantly lower than the applicable duty rate of 30,1 %.
C. SCOPE OF THIS DECISION
(7) The applications in respect of 52 transactions on which anti-dumping duties of GBP [ . . . ] were paid relate to invoices issued within the investigation period set for that review (that is from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996). Since these transactions fall within the investigation period of the review, the merits of the refund applications should be established on the basis of the results of the review investigation in accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation.
(8) This Decision does not concern itself with the applications in respect of the remaining five transactions totalling GBP [ . . . ] of anti-dumping duties. These will be dealt with by another Decision following the conclusions of a separate review, not yet concluded, which was initiated on 3 December 1997 by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (7) further to a request from the Federation for Appropriate Remedial Anti-Dumping (FARAD).
D. ADMISSIBILITY
(9) The applications are inadmissible in respect of two import transactions totalling GBP [ . . . ] of anti-dumping duties because the time-limit of six months prescribed by the Basic Regulation between the determination of duties to be levied and the submission of the applications for refund was not respected with regard to those two transactions.
(10) The applications in respect of the other transactions should be considered as admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Basic Regulation, in particular in respect of time limits.
E. MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS
(11) The Commission considers that the information and findings of the review, whose investigation covered the period from 1 October 1995 to 30 September 1996, should be used in this instance in accordance with the fourth subparagraph of Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation, to determine whether and to what extent a refund is justified for the import transactions which were invoiced by Rubycon Japan between 1 October 1995 and 30 September 1996 (see recital 7).
(12) As mentioned above, the review determined that the dumping margin for the product concerned exported by Rubycon Japan in the period of investigation was 4,2 %. As a result of the comparison with the duty applied, an amount of GBP [ . . . ] is refundable to the applicant and the application should be rejected in so far as concerns the remaining GBP [ . . . ],","{'title': '98/730/EC: Commission Decision of 8 December 1998 concerning applications submitted by Rubycon UK for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of certain large electrolytic aluminium capacitors originating in Japan (notified under document number C(1998) 3542) (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Fishery resources, which are an exhaustible natural resource, should be protected in the interests of biological balances and global food security.
(2) In 1998 the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), to which the European Community is a contracting party, adopted resolution 98-18 concerning unreported and unregulated catches of tuna by large-scale longline vessels in the Convention area.
(3) The stocks concerned cannot be managed effectively by the ICCAT contracting parties, whose fishermen are obliged to reduce their catches of tuna, unless all non-contracting parties fishing Atlantic bigeye tuna cooperate with ICCAT and comply with its conservation and management measures.
(4) ICCAT has identified Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia, Honduras, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Sierra Leone as countries whose vessels fish Atlantic bigeye tuna in a manner which diminishes the effectiveness of the organisation's tuna conservation measures, substantiating its findings with data concerning catches, trade and the activities of vessels.
(5) Imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna originating in Belize, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Honduras and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are currently prohibited by Regulation (EC) No 1036/2001 of 22 May 2001 prohibiting imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnnus obesus) originating in Belize, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Honduras(1).
(6) ICCAT has taken note of the strengthening of cooperation with Honduras for the conservation of Atlantic bigeye tuna. At its 2002 annual meeting it recommended the lifting of the prohibition of imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Honduras.
(7) ICCAT has taken note of the progress of cooperation with Belize and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the conservation of Atlantic bigeye tuna. At its 2003 annual meeting it lifted, as of 1 January 2004, the prohibition of imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna in any form imposed by the contracting parties on Belize and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.
(8) ICCAT's attempts to encourage Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone to comply with measures for the conservation and management of Atlantic bigeye tuna have been to no avail.
(9) ICCAT has recommended its contracting parties to take appropriate steps to prohibit imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna products in any form from Bolivia, Georgia and Sierra Leone and to continue prohibiting such imports from Cambodia and Equatorial Guinea. These measures will be lifted as soon as it is established that the countries in question have brought their fishing practices into line with ICCAT's measures. These measures should therefore be implemented by the Community, which has sole competence in this matter. However, in view of the notification periods required by ICCAT, the ban on imports from Georgia should not enter into force until 1 July 2004.
(10) These measures are compatible with the Community's obligations under other international agreements.
(11) For the sake of transparency, Regulation (EC) No 1036/2001 should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 827/2004 of 26 April 2004 prohibiting imports of Atlantic bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) originating in Bolivia, Cambodia, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia and Sierra Leone and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1036/2001', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, ""importation"" means the customs procedures referred to in Article 4(15)(a), (15)(b) and (16)(a) to (16)(f) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code(2).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in animals. It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin.
(2) Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down the rules for the importation into the Community of live animals, embryos, ova and products of animal origin. The removal of specified risk material from products destined for food and feed is the single most important public health protection measure.
(3) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof to be determined by classification into three categories: negligible BSE risk, controlled BSE risk and undetermined BSE risk. That Article also provides for a reassessment of the Community categorisation of countries following the establishment by the World Organisation for Animal health (OIE) of a procedure for the classification of countries by category.
(4) Pending the adoption of a decision on the BSE status of Member States and third countries, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for transitional measures to be applied for a period ending on 1 July 2007. Under the transitional measures regarding BSE the restrictions on imports into the Community from third countries with a BSE risk covered meat products as defined in Council Directive 77/99/EEC (2), which included treated intestines (animal casings). In addition the possibility of triangular trade was introduced where third countries with a BSE risk could export treated intestines, sourced from countries where BSE was considered highly unlikely.
(5) On 25 June 2007 Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 722/2007 (3). Regulation (EC) 999/2001, as thus amended, introduced a Community categorisation system of countries according their BSE risk, in line with that of the OIE. It entailed not only the listing of all countries under one of three categories: negligible BSE risk, controlled BSE risk and undetermined BSE risk, but also introduced trade rules according to each risk category.
(6) The import rules relating to the new categorisation system referred to meat products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (4), which excluded treated intestines. In line with the conditions applicable before 1 July 2007 and in order to ensure the same level of consumer protection, treated intestines should be included in the list of products covered by the TSE related import rules in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.

It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin.\n\n((2)) Annex IX to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down the rules for the importation into the Community of live animals, embryos, ova and products of animal origin. The removal of specified risk material from products destined for food and feed is the single most important public health protection measure.\n\n((3)) Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) status of Member States or third countries or regions thereof to be determined by classification into three categories: negligible BSE risk, controlled BSE risk and undetermined BSE risk. That Article also provides for a reassessment of the Community categorisation of countries following the establishment by the World Organisation for Animal health (OIE) of a procedure for the classification of countries by category.\n\n((4)) Pending the adoption of a decision on the BSE status of Member States and third countries, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for transitional measures to be applied for a period ending on 1 July 2007. Under the transitional measures regarding BSE the restrictions on imports into the Community from third countries with a BSE risk covered meat products as defined in Council Directive 77/99/EEC(2), which included treated intestines (animal casings). In addition the possibility of triangular trade was introduced where third countries with a BSE risk could export treated intestines, sourced from countries where BSE was considered highly unlikely.\n\n((5)) On 25 June 2007 Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 was amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 722/2007(3). Regulation (EC) 999/2001, as thus amended, introduced a Community categorisation system of countries according their BSE risk, in line with that of the OIE. It entailed not only the listing of all countries under one of three categories: negligible BSE risk, controlled BSE risk and undetermined BSE risk, but also introduced trade rules according to each risk category.\n\n((6)) The import rules relating to the new categorisation system referred to meat products as defined in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin(4), which excluded treated intestines. In line with the conditions applicable before 1 July 2007 and in order to ensure the same level of consumer protection, treated intestines should be included in the list of products covered by the TSE related import rules in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. Annex IX to that Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((7)) No TSE related import conditions apply for third countries with a negligible BSE risk status. It is necessary to clarify the import conditions in case intestines are sourced from a country or a region with a negligible BSE risk and treated in a third country with a different BSE risk status.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 81(2), in conjunction with point (a) of Article 218(6) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions.
(2) The Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Railway Rolling Stock (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Rail Protocol’), adopted in Luxembourg on 23 February 2007, makes a useful contribution to the regulation at international level in its area. It is therefore desirable that the provisions of that instrument which concern matters falling within the exclusive competence of the Union be applied as soon as possible.
(3) The Commission negotiated the Rail Protocol on behalf of the European Community, for the parts falling within the exclusive competence of the Community.
(4) Article XXII(1) of the Rail Protocol provides that Regional Economic Integration Organisations which have competence over certain matters governed by that Protocol may sign, accept, approve or accede to it.
(5) Some of the matters governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 (1), to be replaced as of 10 January 2015 by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 (3), Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), Directive 2008/57/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) and Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), are also dealt with in the Rail Protocol.
(6) The Community signed the Rail Protocol on 10 December 2009 following the adoption, on 30 November 2009, of Council Decision 2009/940/EC (7).
(7) The Union has exclusive competence over some of the matters governed by the Rail Protocol, while the Member States have competence over other matters governed by that instrument.
(8) The Union should therefore approve the Rail Protocol.
(9) Article XXII(2) of the Rail Protocol provides that, at the time of signature, acceptance, approval or accession, a Regional Economic Integration Organisation shall make a declaration specifying the matters governed by that Protocol, in respect of which competence has been transferred to that organisation by its Member States.
(10) The Community made the required declaration regarding its competence at the time of the signature of the Rail Protocol. The Union should, however, renew that declaration at the time of approval of the Rail Protocol in order to correct a factual mistake and to take into account legislative developments and the accession of the Republic of Croatia to the Union.
(11) Articles VI, VIII, IX and X of the Rail Protocol apply only where a Contracting State has made a declaration pursuant to Article XXVII of the Rail Protocol and under the conditions specified by that declaration. At the time of approval of the Rail Protocol, the Union should not make a declaration pursuant to Article XXVII(2) concerning the application of Article VIII, nor should it make any of the declarations pursuant to Article XXVII(1) and (3). The competence of the Member States concerning the rules of substantive law as regards insolvency will not be affected.
(12) The United Kingdom and Ireland are bound by Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, to be replaced as of 10 January 2015 by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012, Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000, Regulation (EC) No 593/2008, Directive 2008/57/EC and Regulation (EC) No 881/2004, and are therefore taking part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

(2) The applicant claims that, following a commercial agreement between Emerald Kalama Chemical BV and DSM Nutritional Products Ltd, the latter owns the marketing rights for the feed additive benzoic acid with effect from 15 April 2014. The applicant has submitted documents supporting its claim.
(3) The proposed change of the terms of the authorisation is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additive concerned. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.
(4) To allow that feed additive to be marketed under the name of DSM Nutritional Products Ltd it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisations.
(5) Regulations (EC) No 1730/2006 and (EC) No 1138/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the amendments made by this Regulation to Regulations (EC) No 1730/2006 and (EC) No 1138/2007, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period during which existing stocks may be used up.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the second indent of Article 50 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) During the outbreaks, in the Netherlands, of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 2000 to 2003, bovine animals were sent for slaughter in the slaughterhouse.
(2) Payment of the slaughter premium as provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 and the related additional payments as provided for in Article 14 of that Regulation for livestock slaughtered in a slaughterhouse was suspended by the Dutch authorities. However, producers of those animals could have received those direct payments provided that the eligibility requirements for the animals concerned were met.
(3) In order to satisfy the legitimate expectations of producers, the slaughter premium and the additional payments should be allowed to be paid up to 15 October 2006 for livestock slaughtered in a slaughterhouse during 2001 in the course of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak under Council Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (2).
(4) For the same reason, this possibility should also be provided for in the case of livestock slaughtered in a slaughterhouse during 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 as part of the measures to control bovine spongiform encephalopathy adopted under Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (3) and Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (4).
(5) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 governing direct payments were repealed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (5) with effect from 1 January 2005. As a result, the measures provided for in this Regulation may no longer be authorised on the basis of those provisions, which raises a specific practical problem.
(6) Payments made under this Regulation should be granted up to maximum ceilings and global amounts.
(7) The amounts of the slaughter premium and the additional payments may have been included in the value of the animals selected for setting the compensation granted under Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (6) and Commission Decision 2001/652/EC of 16 August 2001 concerning a financial contribution towards the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease in the Netherlands in 2001 (7). In that case payment of the slaughter premium and the additional payments would lead to overcompensation of the beneficiaries.

of 5 November 2002
authorising Austria to apply a measure derogating from Article 21 of Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes
(2002/880/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(1), and in particular Article 27(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a request addressed to the Commission, registered by the Commission's Secretariat-General on 7 May 2002, Austria sought authorisation to apply a measure derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(2) The other Member States were informed of Austria's request by letter of 21 June 2002.
(3) Article 21(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as worded in Article 28g thereof, stipulates that, under the internal system, the taxable person supplying taxable goods or services is normally liable to pay value added tax (VAT).
(4) The purpose of the requested derogation is to enable Austria to designate the person to whom the services are provided as the person liable to pay tax, in the following cases: where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to either a general contractor, a company which carries out its own construction work or another subcontractor.
(5) The requested measure is to be considered first and foremost as a measure to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance in the construction sector, such as the non-payment of invoiced VAT by a subcontractor who subsequently becomes untraceable. The measure also has the effect of simplifying the work of the tax authorities, which very frequently have major problems collecting the VAT due by subcontractors in that sector, without having any effect on the amount of tax due.
(6) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued, since it is not intended to apply to all taxable operations in the sector concerned but only to specific operations which pose considerable problems of tax evasion or avoidance.
(7) The authorisation should apply from the date envisaged for the application of the corresponding national provision in the second AbgabenĂ¤nderungsgesetz 2002. It should be limited to 31 December 2007, so that in the light of experience gleaned up to that date an assessment may be made of whether or not the derogation remains justified.
(8) This derogation does not adversely affect the Communities' own resources from VAT,","{'title': '2002/880/EC: Council Decision of 5 November 2002 authorising Austria to apply a measure derogating from Article 21 of Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as worded in Article 28(g) thereof, Austria is hereby authorised, with effect from 1 October 2002, to designate the recipients of the supplies of services referred to in Article 2 of this Decision as the persons liable to pay VAT.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe recipient of the supply of services may be designated as the person liable to pay VAT in the following instances:\n\n1. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to a general contractor;\n\n2. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to a company which carries out its own construction work;\n\n3. where construction work and labour are provided by a subcontractor to another subcontractor.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 December 2007.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Austria.\n\nDone at Brussels, 5 November 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nT.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 of 29 October 1992 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community (2), the Commission adopted, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1539/2006 (3), a plan allocating resources to the Member States to be charged against the 2007 budget year for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community. The plan lays down in particular, for each of the Member States applying the measure, the maximum financial resources available to carry out its part of the plan, and the quantity of each type of product to be withdrawn from the stocks held by the intervention agencies.
(2) Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 requires a revision of the annual plan when changes occurring during its implementation by the Member States concern 5 % or more of the quantities or values entered per product in the Community plan.
(3) The under-utilisation of butter notified to the Commission concerns more than 5 % of the value of the total butter quantity in the annual plan 2007. Furthermore, certain cereals and sugar quantities are no longer required for the 2007 plan.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92, the newly available resources should be allocated to other Member States on the basis of their applications.
(5) During the withdrawal operations of rice held in Greek intervention, it was discovered that the available quantities were not sufficient to allow for the full implementation of the annual plan in Greece. It is therefore necessary to adapt the allocation of intervention products or grants for the purchase on the market of products temporarily unavailable in intervention stocks.
(6) The first and second subparagraphs of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3149/92 set the deadlines for withdrawal of the products from intervention stocks. As the modification of the plan allocates to Poland supplementary quantities of 203 tonnes of cereals and 3 224 tonnes of sugar and to Slovenia a supplementary quantity of 1 000 tonnes of cereals to be withdrawn from intervention stocks, it is appropriate to derogate from those deadlines as regards those quantities.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1539/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 28 July 2008, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the person liable for the payment of value added tax (VAT) to the tax authorities and previously provided for by Council Decision 2007/250/EC of 16 April 2007 (2).
(2) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter of 17 March 2009 of the request made by the United Kingdom. By letter dated 20 March 2009, the Commission notified the United Kingdom that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of the request.
(3) The person liable for the payment of VAT under Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC is the taxable person supplying the goods. However, the derogating measure enabled the United Kingdom to apply, until 30 April 2009 and under certain conditions, a reverse charge mechanism which implied that the liability for the payment of VAT shifted to the taxable person to whom certain supplies of mobile phones and integrated circuit devices were made, provided the taxable amount of the supply was equal to, or higher than, GBP 5 000.
(4) The purpose of that derogating measure was to deal with certain aggressive forms of tax evasion, and in particular with ‘carousel’ schemes whereby goods are supplied several times without VAT being paid to the tax authorities while leaving customers with a valid invoice for VAT deduction. The application of the reverse charge, without actual payment of VAT from the customer to the supplier, removes the possibility of that form of tax evasion.
(5) Given the apparent seriousness of VAT fraud in the United Kingdom, as attested by the information submitted by the United Kingdom, and given the measure’s expected preventive effect, the measure remains proportionate since the extension of the derogation is limited to a reasonable period and the measure remains targeted in scope. Furthermore, it does not form the basis of an overall measure for a generalised reverse charge system.
(6) The derogation has no negative impact on the Community’s own resources accruing from VAT.
(7) Legal continuity of the measure should be ensured,","{'header': '11.6.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 148/14', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 5 May 2009\namending Decision 2007/250/EC authorising the United Kingdom to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2009/439/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In a letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 28 July 2008, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to continue to apply a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the person liable for the payment of value added tax (VAT) to the tax authorities and previously provided for by Council Decision 2007/250/EC of 16 April 2007(2).\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter of 17 March 2009 of the request made by the United Kingdom.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2);
Whereas the laws, regulations or administrative provisions in force in the Member States lay down limits with respect to the sulphur content of liquid fuels ; whereas these provisions differ from one Member State to another;
Whereas the differences in these laws oblige Community oil companies to adjust the maximum sulphur content of these products, depending on which Member State is being supplied ; whereas the aforementioned differences thus constitute a barrier to trade in these products, thereby directly influencing the establishment and functioning of the common market;
Whereas certain Member States have notified the Commission of projects to limit and progressively reduce the sulphur content of fuels so as to achieve a reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions;
Whereas, in view of the considerable effect of the sulphur content of some liquid fuels on public health and the environment and with account being taken of the aforementioned projects, the sulphur content of gas oils must be progressively and significantly reduced at Community level;
Whereas this Directive is a first step towards reducing the sulphur content of liquid fuels and applies to gas oils only;
Whereas, to take account of the technical and economic consequences of reducing and limiting the sulphur content of gas oils and the local circumstances prevailing in the Member States, it will be necessary to define as from 1 October 1976 two types of gas oil, one for general use and the other for use restricted to zones which may be defined by the Member States;
Whereas a simplified procedure should be set up for revising the sulphur content for the two types of gas oil laid down as from 1980 in order to take account of any appreciable developments over the next few years in environmental requirements or desulphurization technology, or of substantial changes in the economic situation in the Community as regards the supply of crude oil ; whereas, however, such revision could take place only before 1 October 1977 as the industry must know several years in advance the sulphur content which shall apply in order to draw up its programmes for desulphurization plant;  (1)OJ No C 76, 3.7.1974, p. 46. (2)OJ No C 16, 23.1.1975, p. 6.
Whereas a sudden change in crude oil supplies leading to an increase in its average sulphur content may, in view of the available desulphurization capacity, jeopardize supplies to consumers in a Member State ; whereas it would therefore seem advisable to authorize that Member State to derogate under certain conditions from the sulphur content limits laid down in respect of its own market;

of 22 December 1987
opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for dried grapes originating in Spain (1988)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal and in particular Articles 30 and 75 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, according to Articles 30 and 75 of the Act of Accession, the duties applicable on the import into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 of dried grapes falling within codes 0806 20 11 and 0806 20 19 of the combined nomenclature and originating in Spain within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 1 900 tonnes shall be progressively abolished; whereas these duties are to be reduced to 62,5 % of the basic duties on 1 January 1988; whereas, by derogation from Article 30 of the Act of Accession, Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/86 of 24 February 1986 concerning the basic duties to be adopted in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal (1) provides that the basic duties are those which actually have been applied on 1 January 1986; whereas, therefore, to establish the duties applicable on the import of these products, a Community tariff quota should be opened for the period 1 January to 31 December 1988 for 1 900 tonnes of dried grapes originating in Spain and falling within codes 0806 20 11, 0806 20 19, ex 0806 20 91 and ex 0806 20 99 of the combined nomenclature at the duty shown in the table in Article 1;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3792/85 of 20 December 1985 laying down the arrangements applying to trade im agricultural products between Spain and Portugal (2) provides for particular rules for the import into Portugal of the products in question, originating in Spain; whereas, consequently, the Community tariff quotas are only applicable in the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985;
Whereas from 1 January 1988 the Nomenclature used under the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized System of Commodity Description and Coding System;
Whereas this Regulation should take into account this fact by including the Combined Nomenclature Codes relevant to the products in question;
Whereas it is in particularly necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports from Spain over a representative reference period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, during the last three years for which statistics are available, imports into each of the Member States were as follows:
(tonnes)
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member States  // 1984   // 1985  // 1986   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 2   // 26  // 6   // Denmark   // 5   // 3,1   // -   // Germany   // 3  // 3   // 4   // Greece   // -   // -   // -   // Spain   // -   // -   // -   // France   // 80   // 103   // 43   // Ireland   // -   // 1   // 1   // Italy   // 7   // 14,9   // 6 1985, p. 7.
Whereas in the last three years the products in question were only imported regularly by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be allocated to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports take place in the latter; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the combined nomenclature;
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared among certain Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover the subsequent requirements of these Member States where they have used up their initial share and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, in order to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota should, under the circumstances, be fixed at 40 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional share is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota amounts have been used up and to inform Member States thereof;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4058/87 of 22 December 1987 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for dried grapes originating in Spain (1988)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1988, on import into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985, the duty for the following products shall be totally suspended within the limits of a Community tariff quota as follows:\n\n1.2.3.4.5 //  //  //  //  //  // Order No  // CN code  // Description  // Amount of quota (tonnes)   // Rate of duty (%)   //    //   //   //   //   // 09.0303   //   // Grapes, fresh or dried   // 1 900   // free   //   //   //  Dried:  //   //   //   //   //   In immediate containers of a net capacity not exceeding 2 kg:   //   //   //   // 0806 20 11  //    Currants   //   //   //   // 0806 20 19   //    Other  //   //   //   //   //   Other   //   //   //   // ex 0806 20 91   //    Currants in immediate containers of a net capacity of 15 kg or less   //   //   //   // ex 0806 20 99   // Other in immediate containers of a net capacity of 15 kg or less   //   //   //    //   //   //   //'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(1) Whereas Commission Decision 98/653/EC of 18 November 1998 concerning emergency measures made necessary by the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Portugal(4) prohibits the dispatch of meat meal, bone meal and meat-and-bone meal of mammalian origin as well as animal feed and fertilisers containing such material from Portugal; whereas Commission Decision 97/735/EC of 21 October 1997 concerning certain protection measures with regard to trade in certain types of mammalian animal waste(5); lays down the conditions for sending processed animal waste to other Member States for incineration or burning as fuel; whereas, however, that possibility is not open to Portugal pursuant to Decision 98/653/EC;
(2) Whereas Portugal has taken measures as notified to the Commission on 12 October 1998, including measures to destroy certain risk materials, to prohibit the incorporation of meat-and-bone meal in any animal feed, to require destruction of meat-and-bone meal, to recall and destroy any stocks of meat-and-bone meal, and of any animal feed that contains meat-and-bone meal; whereas those measures are considered to reduce the risk of exposing humans or animals directly or indirectly to the BSE agent;
(3) Whereas Portugal has informed the Commission that it does not have sufficient capacity on its territory to incinerate meat-and-bone meal, animal feed that contains meat-and-bone meal, and processed specified risk materials; whereas Portugal has proposed to the Commission that it should be possible for such material to be sent for incineration in another Member State; whereas a reduction of the amount of such material stored in Portugal would further reduce the risk of exposing humans or animals directly or indirectly to the BSE agent; whereas, therefore, Portugal should be permitted to dispatch such material from its territory to other Member States for incineration; whereas it is necessary to lay down appropriate guarantees for the controls at the place of destination;
(4) Whereas the prohibition on the dispatch from Portugal of bovine products was to apply only until 1 August 1999, provided that a risk assessment conducted on the basis of the findings of a mission of the Food and Veterinary Office, taking into account the evolution of the disease, demonstrates that appropriate measures have been taken to manage any risk, and that the relevant Community and national measures are complied with and effectively enforced;
(5) Whereas at the General Session of the World Organisation for Animal Health (International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)) Committee from 17 to 21 May 1999, a proposal of the OIE International Animal Health Code Commission concerning the criteria for the determination of the BSE status of a country or zone was adopted; whereas according to those criteria, a country or zone will be classified as having a high incidence of BSE if the BSE incidence rate, calculated over the past 12 months, has been greater than 100 cases per 1000000 within the cattle population over 24 months of age in the country or zone; whereas the current BSE incidence rate in Portugal calculated over the past 12 months per 1000000 animals over 24 months of age is 211; whereas, therefore, Portugal is to be classified as having a high incidence of BSE; whereas Article 3.2.13.9 of that Code recommends conditions for the import of deboned meat and meat products from cattle from a country or zone with a high incidence of BSE; whereas Portugal cannot provide guarantees that those conditions are met;
(6) Whereas missions on BSE related issues have been carried out in Portugal by the Food and Veterinary Office from 22 February to 3 March 1999 and from 19 to 23 April 1999; whereas those missions contributed to the assessment of the application and effectiveness of measures to protect against BSE; whereas those missions concluded that serious efforts and considerable progress had been made in the implementation of risk management measures in a short period, despite not all measures being adequately enforced;
(7) Whereas in those circumstances, it is appropriate to maintain the prohibition on the dispatch of bovine products;
(8) Whereas Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters(6), and in particular Article 10 thereof, lays down the rules for the communication by the competent authorities in the Member States to the Commission of information on operations, which are, or appear to be, contrary to Decision 98/653/EC and which are of particular interest at Community level;
(9) Whereas Directive 89/662/EEC requires the Member State of destination to take appropriate measures in case of irregularities; whereas protocols should be laid down for such measures in the Member States of destination;
(10) Whereas Decision 98/653/EC should be amended accordingly;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3), 11(3), 19(3) and 23(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Commission Decision 96/281/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified soya beans (Glycine max L.) with increased tolerance to the herbicide glyphosate, pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) the United Kingdom gave its consent for placing on the market genetically modified soybean 40-3-2.
(2) Food produced from genetically modified soybean 40-3-2, including food additives, feed materials and feed additives produced from genetically modified soybean 40-3-2 were placed on the market before the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(3) Articles 8(1) and 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 allow the products which have been lawfully placed on the market before the date of application of that Regulation to continue to be placed on the market, provided that a notification is made to the Commission.
(4) Articles 8(4) and 20(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 require the operators responsible for placing on the market those products to submit an application for renewal of authorisation within certain time limits.
(5) On 16 April 2007, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 11 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 for renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing food additives, feed materials and feed additives produced from 40-3-2 soybean which were previously notified according to Articles 8(1)(b) and 20(1)(b) of that Regulation.
(6) On 18 April 2007, Monsanto Europe SA submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 11 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for renewal of the authorisation of food containing, consisting of, or produced from 40-3-2 soybean, feed containing or consisting of 40-3-2 soybean and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of 40-3-2 soybean with the exception of cultivation which were previously notified according to Articles 8(1)(a) and 20(1)(a) of that Regulation.
(7) On 1 December 2010, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave two favourable opinions in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that the new information provided in the applications and the review of the literature published since the previous scientific assessment of 40-3-2 soybean (3) do not require changes of the previous scientific opinions on 40-3-2 soybean and reiterated the previous conclusions that 40-3-2 soybean is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart with respect to potential effects on human and animal health or the environment. Therefore, it concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from 40-3-2 soybean as described in the applications (‘the products’) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed uses (4).
(8) In its opinions, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(9) In its opinions, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(10) Taking into account those considerations, renewal of the authorisation should be granted for the products.
(11) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (5).
(12) On the basis of the EFSA opinions, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 40-3-2 soybean. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which renewal of the authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (6), lays down in Article 4(6) labelling requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(14) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). The EFSA opinions do not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(15) All relevant information on the renewal of the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(16) In the interest of clarity and consistency, Decision 96/281/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.
(17) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and point (c) of Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (8).
(18) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.

Therefore, it concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from 40-3-2 soybean as described in the applications (‘the products’) will have any adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed uses(4).\n\n((8)) In its opinions, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n\n((9)) In its opinions, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.\n\n((10)) Taking into account those considerations, renewal of the authorisation should be granted for the products.\n\n((11)) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms(5).\n\n((12)) On the basis of the EFSA opinions, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from 40-3-2 soybean. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which renewal of the authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.\n\n((13)) Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC(6), lays down in Article 4(6) labelling requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs. Traceability requirements for products containing or consisting of GMOs are laid down in paragraphs 1 to 5 of Article 4 and for food and feed produced from GMOs are laid down in Article 5 of that Regulation.\n\n((14)) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(7). The EFSA opinions do not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Article 6(5) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n\n((15)) All relevant information on the renewal of the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n\n((16)) In the interest of clarity and consistency, Decision 96/281/EC should be repealed and replaced by this Decision.\n\n((17)) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and point (c) of Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms(8).\n\n((18)) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.\n\n((19)) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1564/2001(4), lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef. In particular, Articles 10 and 16(2) define the periods for submitting tenders and delivery respectively. In view of the dates on which the public holidays fall in the first and second quarter of 2002, it is necessary for practical reasons to cancel the second invitation to tender in March 2002 and to change the closing date for the delivery for the second tender of the second quarter of 2002. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 should be derogated from.
(2) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1627/89 of 9 June 1989(5) on the buying-in of beef by invitation to tender, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 238/2002(6), opens buying-in by invitation to tender in certain Member States or regions of a Member State for certain quality groups. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1209/2001(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2579/2001(8), introduced a number of derogations from Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 in order to deal with the exceptional situation on the market caused by events linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the subsequent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. In particular, additional products could be accepted into intervention. As this derogation no longer applies for tendering procedures during the second quarter of 2002, it is necessary to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1627/89 accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 95/233/EC(3), as last amended by Commission Decision 2001/751/EC(4), lists in principle third countries, from which Member States are authorised to import live poultry and hatching eggs including ratites and eggs thereof.
(2) Commission Decision 96/482/EC(5), as last amended by Commission Decision 2000/505/EC(6), lays down more detailed rules for the importation of live poultry and hatching eggs and the relevant animal health certificates.
(3) Commission Decision 96/483/EC(7), as last amended by Commission Decision 96/628/EC(8), establishes the list of third countries, which are entitled to use the specific models of animal health certificates.
(4) Bulgaria has requested to be authorised for exports of live poultry and hatching eggs to the Community and has submitted the necessary guarantees.
(5) An inspection carried out by the Commission's services to Bulgaria in October 2000 has shown that Bulgaria is covered by sufficiently well structured and organised veterinary services regarding the animal health status concerning poultry.
(6) Furthermore the Bulgarian veterinary authorities have been able to demonstrate that the specific animal health requirements as laid down in Decision 96/482/EC are fulfilled.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 4226/88 of 19 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for prepared or preserved sardines originating in Morocco (1989)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 4 of Protocol No 1 to the Agreement on relations in the sea fisheries sector between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (1) states that prepared or preserved sardines falling within CN code ex 1640 13 10 or ex  1604 20 50 and originating in Morocco shall be imported duty-free into the Community within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 17 500 tonnes (net weight); whereas, in order to ensure a regular flow to the Community market under this quota, the  quantities destined for that market may not exceed 60 % of the total volume of the quota in the first half of the year and may not exceed 35 % in the first quarter of the year; whereas at the end of each of these periods the quantities of the products  in question which have been allocated to the Member States and remain unused by the latter should be returned immediately to the Community reserve;
Whereas, within the limits of the tariff quota, Spain and Portugal shall apply the customs duties calculated according to the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988 laying down the arrangements to be applied by Spain and  Portugal to trade with Morocco and Syria (2); whereas the Community tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for 1989;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all the Member States until the quota is  exhausted;
Whereas, for the period during which this Regulation is to apply, specific administrative and economic circumstances make it necessary to maintain allocation of the quota concerned among Member States; whereas, on the one hand, the administrations  concerned will not be in a position to introduce, on 1 January 1989, the conditions essential, from a technical and administrative point of view, for Community administration of this quota; whereas, on the other hand, the prepared and preserved sardines  sector is encountering, in certain regions of the Community, economic constraints of a particular nature, bearing in mind notably the importance which sardine production may have in the fisheries production structure as a whole, thus justifying the fact that the traditional commercial outlets for producers on external markets and, as a matter of priority, on the Community market, should not be  adversely affected;
Whereas, however, it appears advisable to provide for a new increase in the Community reserve;
Whereas, bearing in mind the way in which trade has developed traditionally, the allocation maintained among Member States should, in order to correspond as closely as possible to the real trend of the market for the products in question, be carried out  on a pro rata basis according to the needs of the Member States, calculated on the basis of statistics of imports of the said products from Morocco during a representative reference period and on the economic outlook for the quota periods in question;
Whereas in the last three years the products in question were imported regularly only by certain Member States and not at all or only occasionally by the other Member States; whereas, in these circumstances, in the first phase, initial shares should be  allocated to the genuine importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the tariff quota when imports actually take place; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform collection of the  duties applicable;
Whereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any  subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares and any requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, an appropriate level for the  first part of the Community quota would, in the present circumstances, be 60 % of the quota volume, the second part, 40 % constituting the reserve to which shall also be returned any amounts remaining from the shares allocated when the quota volume was  divided up for the first and second quarters of the current year;
Whereas this method of administration calls for close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission and the Commission must, in particular, be in a position to follow the rate at which the quota is exhausted and inform Member States thereof;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota shares allocated to  that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 4226/88 of 19 December 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for prepared or preserved sardines originating in Morocco (1989)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 of 10 July 1975 on the importation free of Common Customs Tariff duties of educational, scientific and cultural materials (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 608/82 (2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 of 12 December 1979 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas, by letter dated 14 January 1983, Italy has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as 'Scintrex - High Sensitivity Vector Fluxgate Magnetometer, model MFM-3', ordered in November 1980 and intended to be used for the studies of polarization induced with a magnetic detector, the observation and recording of the micropulsations of the earth's magnetic field, caused mainly by solar agents, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

Whereas Article 20d (3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, when certain conditions are met, a decision may be taken that producer groups and associations recognized pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1360/78 (3) may conclude storage  contracts for olive oil; whereas the market situation during the first month of the 1991/92 marketing year has been such that the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 314/88 (4) are met; whereas permission to conclude storage contracts  should therefore be granted for the 1987/88 marketing year;
Whereas the aim behind private storage contracts is temporary withdrawal of products from a market in imbalance, without change of ownership, so that they can be put on the market again when the situation has returned to normal; whereas it should  therefore be specified that storage contracts may be entered into only for olive oil produced during the current marketing year;
Whereas only recognized groups and associations may be authorized to store oil produced by their members; whereas in order to enable them to refrain from marketing the oil that they hold aid should be granted;
Whereas the aim behind private storage must be the improved marketing of olive oil; whereas the period during which storage contracts may be concluded should therefore be restricted; whereas, moreover, the offering of oil for intervention on expiry of  the storage contract should be discouraged; whereas it is accordingly desirable to reduce the storage aid if the oil is subsequently offered for intervention;

Whereas:
(1) Article 77(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU refers solely to ‘debt instruments’, therefore equity instruments in the trading book should not be included in the assessment of materiality of specific risk.
(2) The materiality in absolute terms of exposures to specific risk should be measured by applying the standardised rules for the calculation of net positions of debt instruments. That assessment should consider both long and short net positions calculated in accordance with Article 327(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), after having given an allowance for hedges provided by credit derivatives in accordance with Articles 346 and 347 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 77(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU covering specific risk in the trading book refers to ‘a large number of material positions in debt instruments of different issuers’. These rules therefore set out a materiality threshold for large numbers of material positions in debt instruments of different issuers, pursuant to Article 77(4) of that Directive.
(4) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.
(5) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3),","{'header': '20.5.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 148/50', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) No 530/2014\nof 12 March 2014\nsupplementing Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards further defining material exposures and thresholds for internal approaches to specific risk in the trading book\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 77(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU refers solely to ‘debt instruments’, therefore equity instruments in the trading book should not be included in the assessment of materiality of specific risk.\n\n((2)) The materiality in absolute terms of exposures to specific risk should be measured by applying the standardised rules for the calculation of net positions of debt instruments.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 14569 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 409/2001(5) should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

(2) On 24 November 2013, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, supported by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, reached an agreement with Iran on a Joint Plan of Action which sets out an approach towards reaching a long-term comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. It was agreed that the process leading to this comprehensive solution would include, as a first step, initial mutually-agreed measures to be taken by both sides for a duration of six months and renewable by mutual consent.
(3) As part of this first step, Iran would undertake a number of voluntary measures as specified in the Joint Plan of Action. In return, a number of voluntary measures would be undertaken which would include, for the Union, the suspension of restrictive measures concerning the prohibition on the provision of insurance and reinsurance and transport for Iranian crude oil, the prohibition on the import, purchase or transport of Iranian petrochemical products and on the provision of related services, and the prohibition on trade in gold and precious metals with the Government of Iran, its public bodies and the Central Bank of Iran, or persons and entities acting on their behalf. The suspension of those restrictive measures is to last for a duration of six months during which the relevant contracts would have to be executed.
(4) Furthermore, the Joint Plan of Action also foresees a tenfold increase of the authorisation thresholds in relation to the transfers of funds to and from Iran.
(5) Further action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain measures provided for in this Decision.
(6) Decision 2010/413/CFSP should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '20.1.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 15/22', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION 2014/21/CFSP\nof 20 January 2014\namending Council Decision 2010/413/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 26 July 2010, the Council adopted Decision 2010/413/CFSP(1)concerning restrictive measures against Iran.\n\n((2)) On 24 November 2013, China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, supported by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, reached an agreement with Iran on a Joint Plan of Action which sets out an approach towards reaching a long-term comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear issue.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/18/EC(2), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the program of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), and in particular Article 7(3A)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 15 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), has designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Fentin hydroxide is one of the 90 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, the United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 11 November 1996 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifier (Agrevo, now Aventis) as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(6) The assessment report prepared by the United Kingdom has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 7 December 2001 in the format of the Commission review report for fentin hydroxide, in accordance with Article 7(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(7) Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing fentin hydroxide satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the safety of operators potentially exposed to fentin hydroxide and with regard to its possible impact on non-target organisms.
(8) Fentin hydroxide should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing fentin hydroxide will be withdrawn within a certain period and will not be renewed and that no new authorisations for such products will be granted.
(10) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing fentin hydroxide allowed by Member State, in accordance with Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(11) This decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances(7), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.

(2) Appendix A to Annex X to the 2003 Act of Accession has been amended by Commission Decisions 2004/462/EC (3) and 2004/472/EC (4).
(3) According to an official declaration from the Hungarian competent authority, certain establishments in the meat sector have completed their upgrading process and are now in full compliance with Community legislation. Certain establishments have ceased their activities. Those establishments should therefore be deleted from the list of establishments in transition.
(4) The status of two meat establishments and their reclassification as low capacity establishments is still under discussion with the Hungarian competent authority. It is necessary to foresee a short supplementary time in view to clarify the situation.
(5) Furthermore a limited number of establishments have made considerable efforts to comply with structural requirements laid down by Community legislation. However those establishments are not in a position to finish their upgrading process by the prescribed deadline due to exceptional technical constraints. Therefore it is justified to allow them further time to complete the upgrading process.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 28 January 2014
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Croatia
(2014/56/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(6) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Croatia,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 TFEU, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 (1), which is part of the SGP, provides for a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol No 12 on the excessive deficit procedure, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and TFEU sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of those provisions.
(4) According to Article 126(5) TFEU, if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it is to address an opinion to the Member State concerned and is to inform the Council accordingly.
(5) Having taken into account its report under Article 126(3) TFEU and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 126(4) TFEU, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit existed in Croatia. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to Croatia and informed the Council on 10 December 2013 (3) accordingly.
(6) Article 126(6) TFEU provides that the Council is to consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Croatia, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(7) According to the revision of the 2013 budget and the draft 2014 budget (4) adopted by the Croatian Government and sent to the Croatian Parliament on 14 November 2013, the Croatian authorities envisage a general government deficit of 5,5 % of GDP for 2013, after 5 % of GDP in 2012, and expect the ratio to remain unchanged in 2014 and to decrease only gradually in 2015 and 2016. The Commission services’ 2013 autumn forecast, released on 5 November 2013, projects the general government deficit to be significantly above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value already in 2013, rising to above 6 % of GDP in the 2013-2015 period in the absence of countervailing measures. As indicated in the Commission report prepared pursuant to Article 126(3) TFEU, the planned and forecast deficits are above, and not close to, the Treaty reference value. The excess over the reference value can be considered as exceptional within the meaning of the SGP. In particular, it results in part from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the SGP. Economic activity is estimated to have contracted by almost 12 % since the peak in 2008. Real GDP is projected to contract further in 2013, with a slight recovery expected only in 2014. Potential output growth, as estimated by the Commission services according to the commonly agreed method, stagnated in 2009, turned negative in 2010, and has been negative since then. The calculated output gap, which has been negative since 2009, is expected to narrow gradually over the forecast period and yet remain negative through 2015, confirming the depth and the extension of the recession. However, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary in the sense of the SGP. According to the projections of the Croatian authorities and the Commission services’ 2013 autumn forecast, the general government deficit will remain significantly above the reference value also in 2014 and 2015. The requirement concerning the deficit criterion in the TFEU is therefore not fulfilled.
(8) In the draft 2014 budget, the government foresees an increase in the general government debt ratio from 58,1 % in 2013 to 62 % in 2014 and further to 64,1 % in 2015 and 64,7 % in 2016. These figures are slightly higher than those in Croatia’s Economic and Fiscal Policy Guidelines of September 2013, in which the government forecast the general government debt ratio to reach 56,6 % in 2013, and 60,6 %, 63,4 % and 65,3 % in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. In the Commission services’ 2013 autumn forecast, the projection for the general government debt ratio is 59,7 % for 2013. On unchanged policies, the general government debt ratio is expected to rise above 60 % in 2014, thus exceeding the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value. According to currently available information, a USD-denominated bond issuance in November 2013 would bring the general government debt ratio above the 60 % threshold already by the end of 2013. Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) 1467/97 stipulates that the requirement under the debt criterion is also to be considered to be fulfilled if the budgetary forecasts of the Commission indicate that the required reduction in the differential with respect to the reference value will occur over the three-year period encompassing the two years following the final year for which the data is available. The forecasts of the Croatian authorities and of the Commission services show that the general government debt ratio is on an upward trend on account of continuing high deficits and weak economic activity and it is expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Hence the debt benchmark and thus the debt criterion in the TFEU are not fulfilled.
(9) In line with the provisions of the TFEU, the Commission also analysed the ‘relevant factors’ in its report under Article 126(3) TFEU. As specified in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, for countries with a general government debt ratio above the reference value, those factors are to be taken into account in the steps leading to the decision on the compliance with the deficit criterion if the general government deficit remains close to the reference value and if its excess over the reference value is temporary, which is not the case for Croatia. The relevant factors, in particular the deep and protracted recession, against the backdrop of unsupportive external conditions, have been taken into account in the assessment of compliance with the debt criterion. However, the relevant factors do not modify the conclusion that the debt criterion in the TFEU is not fulfilled,","{'header': '6.2.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 36/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 28 January 2014\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Croatia\n(2014/56/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 TFEU, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97(1), which is part of the SGP, provides for a Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

The requirement concerning the deficit criterion in the TFEU is therefore not fulfilled.\n\n((8)) In the draft 2014 budget, the government foresees an increase in the general government debt ratio from 58,1\xa0% in 2013 to 62\xa0% in 2014 and further to 64,1\xa0% in 2015 and 64,7\xa0% in 2016. These figures are slightly higher than those in Croatia’s Economic and Fiscal Policy Guidelines of September 2013, in which the government forecast the general government debt ratio to reach 56,6\xa0% in 2013, and 60,6\xa0%, 63,4\xa0% and 65,3\xa0% in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. In the Commission services’ 2013 autumn forecast, the projection for the general government debt ratio is 59,7\xa0% for 2013. On unchanged policies, the general government debt ratio is expected to rise above 60\xa0% in 2014, thus exceeding the 60\xa0% of GDP Treaty reference value. According to currently available information, a USD-denominated bond issuance in November 2013 would bring the general government debt ratio above the 60\xa0% threshold already by the end of 2013. Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) 1467/97 stipulates that the requirement under the debt criterion is also to be considered to be fulfilled if the budgetary forecasts of the Commission indicate that the required reduction in the differential with respect to the reference value will occur over the three-year period encompassing the two years following the final year for which the data is available. The forecasts of the Croatian authorities and of the Commission services show that the general government debt ratio is on an upward trend on account of continuing high deficits and weak economic activity and it is expected to remain so over the forecast horizon. Hence the debt benchmark and thus the debt criterion in the TFEU are not fulfilled.\n\n((9)) In line with the provisions of the TFEU, the Commission also analysed the ‘relevant factors’ in its report under Article 126(3) TFEU. As specified in Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, for countries with a general government debt ratio above the reference value, those factors are to be taken into account in the steps leading to the decision on the compliance with the deficit criterion if the general government deficit remains close to the reference value and if its excess over the reference value is temporary, which is not the case for Croatia. The relevant factors, in particular the deep and protracted recession, against the backdrop of unsupportive external conditions, have been taken into account in the assessment of compliance with the debt criterion. However, the relevant factors do not modify the conclusion that the debt criterion in the TFEU is not fulfilled,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Croatia.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Croatia.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2302/2002(4), lays down, inter alia, detailed rules for the application to milk and milk products of the import arrangements provided for in the Europe Agreements between the Community and its Member States, of the one part, and certain Central and East European countries, of the other part. In order to implement the concessions provided for by Council Decisions 2003/263/EC(5), 2003/298/EC(6) and 2003/299/EC(7) on the conclusion of Protocols adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreements establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Poland, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, of the other part, the new import tariff quotas should be opened and certain existing quotas should be increased.

The references made to that Regulation in Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 should, therefore, be replaced.
(5) The first subparagraph of Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 lays down that importers may lodge only one licence application each for the same quota. An exception is made for quotas for products originating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where quota numbers are identical since the two countries were previously one country. The quota numbers for those two countries are to be differentiated from 1 May 2003. That exception should consequently be abolished.
(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 312/2003 of 18 February 2003 implementing for the Community the tariff provisions laid down in the Agreement establishing an association between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Chile, of the other part(10), provides for quota No 09.1924 to be managed on a ""first come, first served"" basis, in accordance with Articles 308a to 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(11), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 444/2003(12).
