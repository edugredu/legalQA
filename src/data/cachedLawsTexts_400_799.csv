Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 of 28 June 1996 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2104/2001(4), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the rates of duty in the Common Customs Tariff are to be charged on import of the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation. However, in the case of the products referred to in paragraph 2 of that Article, the import duty is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However, that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.
(2) Pursuant to Article 10(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92, the cif import prices are calculated on the basis of the representative prices for the product in question on the world market.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 lays down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards import duties in the cereals sector.
(4) The import duties are applicable until new duties are fixed and enter into force. They also remain in force in cases where no quotation is available for the reference exchange referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 during the two weeks preceding the next periodical fixing.
(5) In order to allow the import duty system to function normally, the representative market rates recorded during a reference period should be used for calculating the duties.
(6) Application of Regulation (EC) No 1249/96 results in import duties being fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2340/2001 of 30 November 2001 fixing the import duties in the cereals sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe import duties in the cereals sector referred to in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 shall be those fixed in Annex I to this Regulation on the basis of the information given in Annex II.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 December 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 November 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 161, 29.6.1996, p. 125.\n\n(4) OJ L 283, 27.10.2001, p. 8.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_I', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX I', 'text': 'ANNEX I\n\nImport duties for the products covered by Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nFactors for calculating duties\n\n(period from 15 to 29 November 2001)\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the adoption of Directive 97/12/EC (4) provided an improved legal basis for implementation of measures to prevent spread of animal diseases via trade in live bovine animals and swine;
Whereas Directive 97/12/EC contained special requirements for further updating of the criteria for defining the health status of animal populations at herd, region and Member State level as regards bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and enzootic bovine leucosis; whereas the updating of these criteria should, based on a proposal submitted to the Council before July 1997, have been decided before 1 January 1998;
Whereas the review carried out by the Council of diagnostic procedures of most importance for implementation of effective surveillance and monitoring programmes for bovine tuberculosis, bovine brucellosis and enzootic bovine leucosis included in-depth examination of laboratory testing methods and resulted in time-consuming deliberations;
Whereas the changes required for updated monitoring programmes and surveillance programmes cannot be implemented in this field at short notice;
Whereas in accordance with Directive 97/12/EC swine intended for intra-Community trade are no longer subjected to brucellosis testing prior to departure; whereas, this provision should be anticipated in order to facilitate trade between the Member States;
Whereas to avoid obstacles in intra-Community trade and to ensure uniform application of the provisions, harmonised rules concerning the use and the issue of health certificates should be laid down for the period until the date by which the Member States have to comply with the amended provisions of Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (5);
Whereas on 24 June 1998 the Council adopted Directive 98/46/EC to amend the Annexes A, D (Chapter I) and F of Directive 64/432/EEC; whereas owing to this amendment certain references in Directive 97/12/EC have changed;
Whereas this fact has been taken into account by attaching a table of correspondence in Annex II to Directive 98/46/EC; whereas for the sake of improved clarity and of the coherence of the legal texts it is necessary to correct the references in the corresponding articles;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to amend Directive 97/12/EC in particular as regards the period made available for Member States to transpose and introduce new rules for disease monitoring and surveillance,","{'title': 'Council Directive 98/99/EC of 14 December 1998 amending Directive 97/12/EC amending and updating Directive 64/432/EEC on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDirective 97/12/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Duration of the programme\n\nThe programme covers the period 1 January 1985 to 31 December 1990.\n\n4. Objective of the programme\n\nThe objectives of the programme are:\n\n- development, rationalization and improvement of the processing and marketing conditions for fishery products, particularly herring and introduction of new production techniques intended to increase the value added to the basic products,\n\n- improving the quality standards, more particularly with regard to crustaceans and molluscs, by investment relating to hygiene and sanitary facilities.\n\n5. Actions envisaged and priorities\n\nWithin the general framework of the programme, first priority will be the stimulation of investment concerning the processing of herring. A second priority will be given to actions aimed at improving the hygiene quality of crustaceans and molluscs, particularly with regard to shrimps and mussels.\n\nThe third priority will be given to investment in facilities for the production of other high-value-added products (for example: conserves and prepared dishes).\n\n6. Investment forecasts (million ECU)\n\nThe total amount of investment for the duration of the programme is 40 million ECU to attain the foreseen objectives.\n\nThe national aid for the duration of the programme is scheduled at 3,2 million ECU, attributed in approximately equal annual proportions.\n\nWith regard to the abovementioned actions, the scheduled investment can be broken down as:\n\n- investment into the processing of herring: 16 million ECU,\n\n- investment into the sector of crustaceans and molluscs: 12 million ECU,\n\n- other investment: 12 million ECU.\n\nThe financial data, as well as the breakdown between various types of investments, are indicative.'}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nFINAL CONCLUSIONS\n\n1. The Commission considers that the programme submitted by the Netherlands Government as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis, following the adoption of the common fisheries policy, to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the prospective development of the resources and of the consequences and objectives of the pluriannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture (1) for the future development of the processing and marketing of fishery products.\n\nAs the basic measures for restructuring the fishing fleet and for developing aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission adopts the programme only for the years 1985 and 1986, in order to ensure that the structural measures with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture envisaged for 1987 and later can be adequately taken into consideration in relation to the sector for the processing and marketing of fishery products.\n\nGiven the resource situation and the fact that the Dutch fishing fleet has to be reduced to adapt it to these resources, the Commission considers that the priority aspects of the programme are of a qualitative nature.\n\nAs the processing facilities for herring have been strongly affected by the reduced catch possibilities in recent years, the Commission requests the Netherlands Government to monitor particularly this sector so as to ensure a balanced development with regard to the resources and to the marketing.\n\n2. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in this programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n\n3. The Commission considers that the programme objectives and their attainment should form the subject of a more detailed analysis in the framework of the reconsideration for the period starting from 1 January 1987 in the light of the development in the fishing industry and in aquaculture.\n\n(1) OJ No L 157, 15. 6. 1985.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) The Commission consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal.
(2) Ukraine is undertaking fundamental political and economic reforms and is making substantial efforts to implement a market economy model.
(3) Ukraine, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, have concluded a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement which will help the development of a full cooperation relationship.
(4) The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was closed down in December 2000, in line with what was agreed by the Ukrainian authorities, the Group of Seven countries and the European Union in a Memorandum of Understanding signed on 21 December 1995.
(5) In September 1998, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an ""extended fund facility"" (EFF) for Ukraine of approximately USD 2,3 billion, later increased to approximately USD 2,6 billion, in support of an economic programme for the period July 1998 to June 2001. In December 2000, the IMF extended the duration of this financial arrangement to August 2002. Since 1998 the World Bank has provided substantial support for Ukraine's reform efforts, including through the approval in September 1998 of a USD 300 million Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL). The World Bank is expected to continue providing substantial financial assistance to Ukraine in the coming years, including through the approval of a number of adjustment loans.
(6) In July 2001 the Members of the Paris Club agreed on a rescheduling of Ukraine's debts.
(7) By Decisions 94/940/EC(3), 95/442/EC(4) and 98/592/EC(5) the Council approved macro-financial assistance for Ukraine of up to a total amount of EUR 435 million to support previous macroeconomic programmes.
(8) The circumstances that justified the provision of macro-financial assistance to Ukraine pursuant to Decision 98/592/EC have changed and this Decision, including any undisbursed amounts of assistance, should now be replaced.
(9) However, additional official support from the Community is required in the context of the present programme to support the balance of payments, consolidate the reserve position and facilitate the necessary structural adjustment of the country.
(10) The Community loan should be managed by the Commission.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 provides that products of animal origin are only to be imported from a third country or part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists, account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of third countries, as regards compliance or equivalence with the Union feed and food law and animal health rules as specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(3) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted (3) lists those third countries which satisfy the criteria referred to in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and are therefore able to guarantee that exports of those products to the Union meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Union legislation to protect the health of consumers. In particular, Annex I to that Decision sets out a list of third countries from which imports are permitted of bivalve molluscs, tunicates, echinoderms and marine gastropods and Annex II to that Decision sets out a list of third countries and territories from which imports of fishery products for human consumption are permitted. Those lists also indicate restrictions concerning such imports from certain third countries.
(4) A Commission inspection was carried out in Croatia from 23 November to 2 December 2010 to evaluate the control systems in place governing the production of live bivalve molluscs intended for export to the Union. A number of deficiencies were identified which were subsequently corrected. The control systems in place in that third country currently provide sufficient guarantees to ensure adequate consumer health protection for bivalve molluscs exported from Croatia to the Union. Croatia should therefore be included in the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2006/766/EC.
(5) A Commission inspection was carried out in Brunei from 25 to 28 April 2012 to evaluate the control systems in place governing the production of fishery products intended for export to the Union. No deficiencies considered to have significant implications for consumer health protection were identified during that inspection with regard to the production of aquaculture products. Brunei should therefore be included in the list of third countries set out in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC, together with an indication that only imports of aquaculture products are permitted into the Union from that third country.
(6) A Commission inspection was carried out in Togo from 8 to 11 June 2009. Official checks and hygiene certification for the export of live lobsters was found to be satisfactory, but deficiencies were noted in the control system for smoked fishery products intended for export to the Union. In view of those deficiencies, Togo was included in the list set out in Annex II to Decision 2006/766/EC, as amended by Commission Decision 2009/951/EU (4), together with an indication that only imports of live lobsters are permitted into the Union from that third country.
(7) The deficiencies identified during the Commission inspection visit to Togo were subsequently addressed. Control systems were established to conduct microbial and chemical analyses of smoked fishery products. Analytical reports and other information submitted by the competent authority provide sufficient guarantees to ensure adequate consumer health protection for all fishery products for human consumption, other than live, chilled, frozen or processed bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods, exported from Togo to the Union.
(8) Following an internal reform in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, effective as of 10 October 2010, the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist as an autonomous country within that Kingdom. On that same date, Curaçao and Sint Maarten gained the status of autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, while Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba became special municipalities of the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
(9) Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba remain nevertheless included in the list of overseas countries and territories set out in Annex II to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Thus they are overseas countries and territories to which the provisions of part four of the Treaty apply.
(10) Being part of the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the implementation of the Treaties for those territories is ensured by the Netherlands and the tasks of the competent authority for sanitary matters in those special municipalities are carried out by the competent authorities of the Netherlands. The competent authorities of the Netherlands have presented the necessary information to the Commission to prove that the sanitary control system in place in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba provides sufficient guarantees of compliance with Union requirements. The information provided also shows that those authorities have the same legal powers to conduct controls as the competent authority of the Netherlands Antilles used to have and that food business operators are bound by the same obligations. In addition, according to that information, the official sanitary controls in those special municipalities continue at the same levels as in the period before the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist.
(11) Decision 2006/766/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '8.11.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 308/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 6 November 2012\namending the Annexes to Decision 2006/766/EC as regards the entries in the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products for human consumption are permitted\n(notified under document C(2012) 7696)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/692/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 provides that products of animal origin are only to be imported from a third country or part of a third country that appears on a list drawn up in accordance with that Regulation.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 also provides that when drawing up and updating such lists, account is to be taken of Union controls in third countries and guarantees provided by the competent authorities of third countries, as regards compliance or equivalence with the Union feed and food law and animal health rules as specified in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules(2).\n\n((3)) Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted(3)lists those third countries which satisfy the criteria referred to in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 and are therefore able to guarantee that exports of those products to the Union meet the sanitary conditions laid down in Union legislation to protect the health of consumers.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 (1), and in particular Article 180 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the list of concessions annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, as concluded by the Council by Decision 94/800/EC (2), the European Union is committed to establishing import duty for certain cereals at a level so that the duty-paid import price will not be greater than the effective intervention price increased by 55 %.
(2) With a view to acting on that commitment, Article 136 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 (3) requires in particular for import duty on certain cereals to be equal to the intervention price valid for those cereals on importation increased by 55 %, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. Commission Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 (4) establishes detailed rules for the implementation of that Article.
(3) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, which repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, does not contain a provision similar to Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. As regards the calculation of import duties for agricultural products, Article 180 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 enables the Commission to adopt implementing acts setting out measures to comply with requirements laid down, inter alia, in international agreements which have been concluded in accordance with the TFEU.
(4) In order to respect the Union’s international commitments, a method for calculating import duty which is consistent with the list of concessions by the European Union should be included in Regulation (EU) No 642/2010.
(5) Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 provides for the fixing of import duties on the 15th and last working days of each month, to apply to the following 15-day period and also for a possible adjustment during each of the periods of application. In order to simplify the current method, the principle of the automatic fixing of duties applicable to the start of each 15-day period should be abandoned and only take place if the result of the calculation differs from a specific amount compared to the result which gave rise to the previous fixing or if the result of the fixing is once again nil.
(6) In order to avoid speculation and to ensure that the measure is managed efficiently, it should be stipulated that the fixing of import duties should apply from the date of publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(7) The first subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 states that for fixing and adjustments, the daily import duties used for the previous period must not be taken into account. The number of days used therefore varies gradually in line with trends in the 15-day period of application. In order to provide that a constant number of days is chosen equal to 10 working days, this provision should be removed.
(8) The second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 provides that the intervention price to be used for calculating duties must be the price applicable during the month in which the import duty applies. Given that monthly increases in the intervention price have not applied since the 2009/10 marketing year for durum wheat and since the 2010/11 marketing year for common wheat, barley, maize and sorghum and the intervention price to be used is fixed, this provision should be amended.
(9) The second subparagraph of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 states that import duties must be published in the Official Journal of the European Union on the occasion of each fixing or adjustment. Given that adjustments are to be discontinued, this provision should be amended.
(10) Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 requires the representative cif import prices for durum wheat to be based in particular on the reference exchange stipulated under Annex III to the Regulation, namely the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Due to the change in United States durum wheat production on the world market, this exchange no longer provides a representative and reliable estimate of the durum wheat market. Furthermore, the other sources of information on the world durum wheat market are now too few or too unreliable to provide a basis for setting import duties for this product. Finally, the available sources indicate that prices for high quality durum wheat and high quality common wheat exported to the United States are following similar trends. Consequently, the duty calculated for high quality common wheat should be applied to high quality durum wheat. Moreover, for medium and low quality durum wheat, discounts linked to meal quality should also be applied.

Commission Regulation (EU) No 642/2010(4)establishes detailed rules for the implementation of that Article.\n\n((3)) Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, which repeals and replaces Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, does not contain a provision similar to Article 136 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. As regards the calculation of import duties for agricultural products, Article 180 of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 enables the Commission to adopt implementing acts setting out measures to comply with requirements laid down, inter alia, in international agreements which have been concluded in accordance with the TFEU.\n\n((4)) In order to respect the Union’s international commitments, a method for calculating import duty which is consistent with the list of concessions by the European Union should be included in Regulation (EU) No 642/2010.\n\n((5)) Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 provides for the fixing of import duties on the 15th and last working days of each month, to apply to the following 15-day period and also for a possible adjustment during each of the periods of application. In order to simplify the current method, the principle of the automatic fixing of duties applicable to the start of each 15-day period should be abandoned and only take place if the result of the calculation differs from a specific amount compared to the result which gave rise to the previous fixing or if the result of the fixing is once again nil.\n\n((6)) In order to avoid speculation and to ensure that the measure is managed efficiently, it should be stipulated that the fixing of import duties should apply from the date of publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n\n((7)) The first subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 states that for fixing and adjustments, the daily import duties used for the previous period must not be taken into account. The number of days used therefore varies gradually in line with trends in the 15-day period of application. In order to provide that a constant number of days is chosen equal to 10 working days, this provision should be removed.\n\n((8)) The second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 provides that the intervention price to be used for calculating duties must be the price applicable during the month in which the import duty applies. Given that monthly increases in the intervention price have not applied since the 2009/10 marketing year for durum wheat and since the 2010/11 marketing year for common wheat, barley, maize and sorghum and the intervention price to be used is fixed, this provision should be amended.\n\n((9)) The second subparagraph of Article 2(3) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 states that import duties must be published in theOfficial Journal of the European Unionon the occasion of each fixing or adjustment. Given that adjustments are to be discontinued, this provision should be amended.\n\n((10)) Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 requires the representative cif import prices for durum wheat to be based in particular on the reference exchange stipulated under Annex III to the Regulation, namely the Minneapolis Grain Exchange. Due to the change in United States durum wheat production on the world market, this exchange no longer provides a representative and reliable estimate of the durum wheat market. Furthermore, the other sources of information on the world durum wheat market are now too few or too unreliable to provide a basis for setting import duties for this product. Finally, the available sources indicate that prices for high quality durum wheat and high quality common wheat exported to the United States are following similar trends. Consequently, the duty calculated for high quality common wheat should be applied to high quality durum wheat. Moreover, for medium and low quality durum wheat, discounts linked to meal quality should also be applied.\n\n((11)) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011(5)provided for amendments to be made to the CN codes for cereals with effect from 1 January 2012. The references to the CN codes contained in Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 must therefore be changed in line with those amendments.\n\n((12)) Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EU) No 642/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nArticle 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Notwithstanding the rates of import duty in the Common Customs Tariff, the import duty on products falling within CN codes 1001\xa011\xa000 , 1001\xa019\xa000 , ex\xa01001\xa091\xa020  (common wheat seed), ex\xa01001\xa099\xa000  (high-quality common wheat other than seed), 1002\xa010\xa000 , 1002\xa090\xa000 , 1005\xa010\xa090 , 1005\xa090\xa000 , 1007\xa010\xa090  and 1007\xa090\xa000  shall be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55\xa0%, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas pursuant to Council Directive 80/215/EEC of 22 January 1980 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (3), as last amended by Directive 87/491/EEC (4), the prohibition on the export of live swine, fresh pigmeat and certain meat products may be imposed for one or more parts of the territory of a Member State where African swine fever has been recorded within the previous 12 months;
Whereas Council Decision 89/21/EEC of 14 December 1988 derogating from prohibitions relating to African swine fever for certain areas in Spain (5) limited the said prohibitions to the areas south and west of the line laid down in the Annex of that Decision;
Whereas in these regions the market situation has deteriorated during the last months; whereas this has created economic difficultues for producers breeding the iberian pig; whereas these difficulties are sufficiently serious to justify the introduction of exceptional market support measures in order to alleviate the situation of these producers;
Whereas these exceptional measures should take the form of aid for private storage to be granted according to the rules fixed in respect of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2763/75 of 29 October 1985 laying down general rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat (6) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80 of 2 May 1980 laying down detailed rules for granting private storage aid for pigmeat (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3498/88 (8);
Whereas, in order to avoid any excess due to the application of these aids, provision should be made to restrict these aids for products from the iberian pig breed and from the abovementioned areas;
Whereas Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2763/75 provides that the period of storage can be curtailed or extended if the market situation so requires; whereas Article 8 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1092/80 provides for early withdrawal from store for export; whereas the period of storage may also be curtailed in case of force majeure as referred to in Article 9 of the said Regulation; whereas, therefore, provision should be made to fix not only the amounts of aid for a specific period of storage but also the amounts to be added or deducted if this period is curtailed or extended;
Whereas, in order to facilitate administrative and control work resulting from the conclusion of contracts, minimum quantities should be fixed;
Whereas the security should be fixed at a level such as to oblige the storer to fulfil the obligations undertaken by him;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 403/2006
of 8 March 2006
fixing the export refunds on beef and veal
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular Article 33, paragraph 3, third indent, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulations (EEC) No 32/82 (2), (EEC) No 1964/82 (3), (EEC) No 2388/84 (4), (EEC) No 2973/79 (5) and (EC) No 2051/96 (6) lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products, and the conditions for granting of assistance concerning certain destinations.
(3) The increasing shortage of beef and veal on the Community market has pushed prices significantly beyond the basic price as referred to in Article 26(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, which represents the desired support level on the Community market.
(4) There is increasing general public concern for the welfare of animals which are exported over particularly long distances and for which humane treatment cannot be completely ensured, in particular once they are delivered in third countries. As regards transport, although the conditions for transport of live animals are subject to massive substantive, procedural and control requirements that were reinforced in 2003 experience shows that the respect of animal welfare conditions is not always ensured. Moreover, animal welfare standards in the countries of destination are often lower than in the Community.
(5) Exports of live animals for slaughter represent a lower value added for the Community and export refunds granted for the export of those animals imply higher costs for the monitoring and control of animal welfare conditions. Therefore, in order to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the internal market, as well as the welfare of animals, exports of live animals for slaughter to third countries should no longer be encouraged by virtue of export refunds.
(6) As to live animals for reproduction, in order to prevent any abuse, export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2147/2005 of 23 December 2005 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal (7) should therefore be repealed.
(8) In order to enable some Community beef and veal products to be disposed of on the international market, export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some products under CN codes 0201, 0202 and 1602 50.
(9) The uptake of export refunds for certain categories of beef and veal products proves to be insignificant. This is also the case with regard to the uptake for certain destinations very close to the Community territory. For such categories, export refunds should no longer be fixed.
(10) The refunds provided for in this Regulation are set on the basis of the product codes as defined in the nomenclature adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (8).
(11) The refunds on all frozen cuts should be in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.
(12) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (9).
(13) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat (10), Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products (11) and Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations (12).
(14) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.

As regards transport, although the conditions for transport of live animals are subject to massive substantive, procedural and control requirements that were reinforced in 2003 experience shows that the respect of animal welfare conditions is not always ensured. Moreover, animal welfare standards in the countries of destination are often lower than in the Community.\n\n((5)) Exports of live animals for slaughter represent a lower value added for the Community and export refunds granted for the export of those animals imply higher costs for the monitoring and control of animal welfare conditions. Therefore, in order to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the internal market, as well as the welfare of animals, exports of live animals for slaughter to third countries should no longer be encouraged by virtue of export refunds.\n\n((6)) As to live animals for reproduction, in order to prevent any abuse, export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age.\n\n((7)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2147/2005 of 23 December 2005 fixing the export refunds on beef and veal(7)should therefore be repealed.\n\n((8)) In order to enable some Community beef and veal products to be disposed of on the international market, export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some products under CN codes 0201, 0202 and 1602\xa050.\n\n((9)) The uptake of export refunds for certain categories of beef and veal products proves to be insignificant. This is also the case with regard to the uptake for certain destinations very close to the Community territory. For such categories, export refunds should no longer be fixed.\n\n((10)) The refunds provided for in this Regulation are set on the basis of the product codes as defined in the nomenclature adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds(8).\n\n((11)) The refunds on all frozen cuts should be in line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.\n\n((12)) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602\xa050 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(9).\n\n((13)) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC of 26 June 1964 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in fresh meat(10), Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting intra-Community trade in meat products(11)and Council Directive 94/65/EC of 14 December 1994 laying down the requirements for the production and placing on the market of minced meat and meat preparations(12).\n\n((14)) Pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95\xa0%, but not less than 85\xa0%, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.\n\n((15)) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

(2) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in the Netherlands in 2006. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community’s livestock population. Under Article 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, the Netherlands took measures to combat those outbreaks.
(3) The payment of a Community financial contribution must be made subject to the condition that the planned measures were actually implemented and that the competent authorities provided all the necessary information to the Commission within certain deadlines.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3), following the amendment of Decision 90/424/EEC by Decision 2006/53/EC, no longer covers avian influenza. It is therefore necessary to expressly provide in the present Decision that the granting of a financial contribution to the Netherlands is subject to compliance with certain rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(5) Article 3a(3) of Decision 90/424/EEC provides that the Community financial contribution is to be 50 % of the eligible costs incurred by the Member State.
(6) The Netherlands has fully complied with its technical and administrative obligations as set out in Articles 3(3) and 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC. The Netherlands has forwarded to the Commission information on the costs incurred in the framework of this outbreak on 30 August 2006 and thereafter continued to provide all necessary information on costs of compensation and operational expenditure.

of 5 March 1986
authorizing Spain to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of certain steel products

(86/97/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 379 thereof,
Whereas, by letter of 3 March 1986, the Spanish Government applied to the Commission for authorization to adopt, pursuant to Article 379 of the Act of Accession, protective measures in the sector of steel products;
Whereas in their application the Spanish authorities provided the Commission with information enabling the latter to establish that the Spanish steel industry is currently experiencing serious difficulties that are likely to persist;
Whereas, pursuant to Commission Decision No 3485/85/ECSC (1), production by Spanish undertakings is subject to a system of monitoring; whereas, pursuant to Commission Decision No 3717/83/ECSC (2), which has been applicable to Spanish undertakings since 1 March 1986, deliveries of certain products must be accompanied by a production certificate and an accompanying document;
Whereas deliveries to Spain from steel undertakings in the other Member States have increased sharply since January 1986; whereas import certificates issued for the month of January for the products in these sectors involve quantities of around 400 000 tonnes; whereas according to the figures provided by the Spanish Government actual deliveries in January amounted to some 261 000 tonnes; whereas deliveries of these products in recent years have averaged 100 000 tonnes a month;
Whereas deliveries of the products concerned have thus risen sharply by about 160 % on average since accession; whereas this rise has been particularly marked for the sectors covered by categories Ia, Ib and II, as defined in Decision No 3485/85/ECSC;
Whereas Spanish steel undertakings are currently in the process of restructuring and hence highly vulnerable; whereas the rise in deliveries of steel products from the other Member States is liable to jeopardize this process of restructuring; whereas the volume of deliveries of products from the other Member States is one of the main reasons for the difficulties indicated by the Spanish authorities in their application; whereas if no immediate action is taken these difficulties are likely to persist;
Whereas, under the circumstances, a quantitative restriction on deliveries from the other Member States should allow Spanish steel undertakings to continue their process of restructuring along the lines of the plans referred to in Protocol No 10 attached to the Act of Accession and to redress the situation; whereas this measure should allow the sector, and in particular the undertakings concerned, to adapt to the economy of the common market;
Whereas it is sufficient for the quantitative restriction to apply to categories Ia, Ib and II, as defined by Decision No 3485/85/ECSC, given that the increase in deliveries from the other Member States is concentrated in these three categories;
Whereas authorization of a quantitative restriction up to 31 December 1986 will serve the desired purpose;
Whereas an extension to Spanish undertakings and the Spanish steel market of the quota system applicable to undertakings in the other Member States could help to solve the problems of Spanish steel undertakings; whereas the Commission will take the necessary measures to apply that system to these undertakings as soon as possible;
Whereas in addition to these restrictions on deliveries there is the system of surveillance of products originating in non-member countries established by Commission Recommendation No 3658/85/ECSC (3); whereas this system should be reinforced by more rapid provision of information to the Commission;
Whereas the provisions adopted may not under any circumstances restrict deliveries of each of the products in question to a level below that of actual imports in 1984;
Whereas, to achieve an equitable distribution of the authorized quantities both among the Member States and among the operators concerned, the existing patterns of trade must be respected yet account must also be taken of the interests of any new operators;
Whereas the situation is so grave that the protective measures must apply even to current contracts; whereas, to avoid additional prejudice to the operators concerned, this Decision must not affect goods already in shipment; whereas, however, the Spanish authorities should be allowed the possibility of taking into account the total volume of these shipments for the purposes of distribution of total quantities;
Whereas the proper application of the provisions of this Decision requires the establishment of highly specific implementation and management rules; whereas, to prevent the disturbance in the market of the products in question from worsening, the quantities admitted into Spain up to the end of 1986 should be distributed by quarter, the quantities of the second quarter of 1986 also comprising the quantities for the days in March after this Decision takes effect; whereas, to allow adjustment to demand, it should also be possible to transfer authorizaions between the categories stipulated by this Decision up to 5 % of the limit established for each category;
Whereas the proper application of this Decision requires the establishment of joint information and consultation procedures by the Commission and the Spanish authorities;
Whereas, since this Decision can only be justified if the condition of application referred to in Article 379 of the Act of Accession are still present, the Commission may be prompted to amend or rescind it; whereas the Commission must therefore keep a constant check on the facts underlying this Decision;
Whereas the Commission is obliged to take, in the first place, measures which least disrupt the functioning of the common market; whereas, in the light of the examination that the Commission has conducted of the economic difficulties, the restrictions adopted constitute measures which, while enabling the desired result to be obtained, least disturb the functioning of the common market,","{'title': '86/97/ECSC: Commission Decision of 5 March 1986 authorizing Spain to adopt protective measures in respect of imports of certain steel products (Only the Spanish text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nSpain is hereby authorized under the conditions specified below to restrict up to 31 December 1986 deliveries to Spain of products originating in the other Member countries as listed in Article 2 and defined in the Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe restricted quantities established in accordance with Article 1 shall not be lower than:\n\n- category Ia: 296 083 tonnes,\n\n- category Ib: 172 716 tonnes,\n\n- category II: 36 234 tonnes.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry(1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Whereas:
I
(1) By letter of 16 March 2001, the United Kingdom notified the Commission, in accordance with Article 9(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of the financial aid which it proposed to grant to the coal industry for 2001.
(2) In the light of the information submitted by the United Kingdom, the Commission is required to take a decision on operating aid amounting to GBP 25259000 to cover operating losses, for the period from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2001, in four production units.
(3) The financial measures are covered by Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. The Commission must therefore take a decision on these measures pursuant to Article 9(4) of that Decision. Accordingly, the Commission's approval is subject to the general objectives and criteria laid down in Article 2 and the specific criteria set out in Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and must, more generally, be compatible with the proper functioning of the common market. In addition, in its assessment the Commission is required to check, in accordance with Article 9(6) of that Decision, whether the measures notified are in conformity with the plan for the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring of the United Kingdom coal industry approved by the Commission by Decision 2001/114/ECSC(2) and by Decision 2001/597/ECSC(3) (""the restructuring plan"").
II
(4) The sum of GBP 25259000 which the United Kingdom is proposing to grant to the coal industry under Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC is intended to cover the difference between the production cost and the selling price of coal freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the prevailing conditions on the world market for coal of similar quality from third countries.
(5) The aid is intended for the following units:
(a) GBP 18318000 for the Longannet Mine production unit of Mining (Scotland) Ltd;
(b) GBP 3807000 for the Hatfield Colliery production unit of Hatfield Coal Company Ltd;
(c) GBP 1168000 for the Blenkinsopp Colliery production unit of Blenkinsopp Collieries Ltd;
(d) GBP 1966000 for the Betws Colliery production unit of Betws Anthracite Ltd.
(6) The Commission has already authorised the United Kingdom to grant operating aid pursuant to Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC to the production units for the period from 17 April 2000 to 31 December 2000 amounting to GBP 17462000 for Longannet Mine(4), GBP 3932000 and GBP 470000 respectively for Hatfield Colliery and Blenkinsopp Colliery(5), and GBP 870000 for Betws Colliery(6). In accordance with Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the Commission considered that the aid which the United Kingdom proposed to grant for 2000 was intended to improve the economic viability of the production units concerned by reducing their production costs. The aid should, in accordance with the restructuring plan, help to make the production units viable, enabling them to continue their activities beyond 2002 without public subsidy.
(7) The information transmitted by the United Kingdom in its letter of 16 March 2001 notifying the aid for 2001 confirms the conclusions reached by the Commission in the context of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, with regard to aid for 2000. Production costs at the Hatfield Colliery, Blenkinsopp Colliery and Betws Colliery units must be reduced significantly and, in 2002, should not exceed the economic viability threshold of GBP 1,15/GJ set in the restructuring plan(7) at 1999 prices. In the case of Longannet Mine, the estimated production costs for 2002 are expected to be GBP [...](8)/GJ. The higher quality of the coal produced by Longannet Mine, which in particular has a very low sulphur content, nevertheless enables this production unit to obtain a higher price for it than that generally charged by other United Kingdom producers. The prospects for reducing production costs and the level of debt should therefore enable Longannet Mine to continue its activities beyond 2002 without public subsidy. In addition, according to estimates made up to 2004, the above production units should continue to improve their economic viability by further reducing production costs.
(8) In accordance with Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid which the United Kingdom proposes to grant for 2001 is therefore intended to improve the economic viability of the production units concerned by reducing their production costs.
(9) The modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring measures implemented by each production unit, and in particular the temporary nature of the financial support necessary to achieve these measures, will allow the aid to be degressive, in accordance with the first indent of Article 2(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
(10) At the request of the United Kingdom authorities, a technical report was drawn up by an independent expert to assess whether the modernisation, rationalisation and restructuring measures envisaged for the various production units would enable them to improve their economic viability after the expiry of the ECSC Treaty on 23 July 2002. In drawing up the report, the expert took account of the geological and technical conditions in which the units operate and the quality of the coal produced. The report concluded that the various measures envisaged are consistent and realistic to achieve a situation of economic viability.
(11) In accordance with the first indent of Article 3(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid per tonne as notified does not exceed, for each production unit, the difference between production costs and foreseeable revenue for 2001.
(12) The Commission notes that, for each production unit, an auditor has certified that the financial data notified by the United Kingdom are an accurate reflection of the company's accounts. The auditor also stated that the forecasts had been drawn up using the same accounting standards as were in use before the period covered by the restructuring plan.
(13) In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by the United Kingdom, the aid proposed for 2001 for the production units listed in recital 5 is compatible with Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and in particular with Articles 2 and 3 thereof.
III
(14) The United Kingdom is required to ensure that the aid does not cause any distortion of competition and does not discriminate between coal producers, buyers or consumers in the Community.
(15) In accordance with the third indent of Article 3(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the provisions of Decision 2001/114/ECSC relating thereto, the United Kingdom will take all necessary measures to ensure that the amount of the aid granted to each production unit does not cause delivered prices for Community coal to be lower than those for coal of a similar quality from third countries.
(16) Moreover, in accordance with Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid must be entered in the United Kingdom's national, regional or local public budgets and must comply with strictly equivalent mechanisms.
(17) In accordance with the second indent of Article 3(1) and with Article 9(2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the Commission has to check that the aid authorised is used only for the purposes stipulated in Article 3 of that Decision. At the latest by 30 September 2002, the United Kingdom shall send notification of the amount of aid actually paid during the course of 2001 and shall declare any changes made to the amounts originally notified. Any information required to ascertain that the criteria laid down in Article 3 of the Decision have been complied with shall be provided together with this annual breakdown.
(18) The United Kingdom is required to justify any departures from the restructuring plan and from the economic and financial forecasts notified to the Commission on 16 March 2001. In particular, should it turn out that the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC cannot be met, the United Kingdom must itself propose to the Commission the corrective measures required,","{'title': 'Commission Decision of 8 May 2001 authorising the United Kingdom to grant aid to the coal industry for 2001 (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2001) 1404)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe United Kingdom is authorised, subject to the conditions set out in Article 3 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, to grant operating aid of GBP 25259000 to the Longannet Mine, Hatfield Colliery, Blenkinsopp Colliery and Betws Colliery production units for 2001.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe United Kingdom shall ensure that the authorised aid is used only for the purposes which it has declared in its notification of 16 March 2001, and that any expenditure on items covered by this Decision which is cancelled, overestimated or misused is reimbursed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nWithout prejudice to its obligations under Article 9(1), (2) and (3) of Decision 3632/93/ECSC, the United Kingdom shall, at the latest by 30 September 2002, communicate the amounts of aid actually paid during the financial year 2001.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 May 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nLoyola De Palacio\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1993, p. 12.\n\n(2) OJ L 43, 14.2.2001, p. 27.\n\n(3) OJ L 210, 3.8.2001, p. 32.\n\n(4) Commission Decision 2001/217/ECSC of 13 December 2000 (OJ L 81, 21.3.2001, p. 31).\n\n(5) Commission Decision 2001/340/ECSC of 13 February 2001 (OJ L 122, 3.5.2001, p. 23).\n\n(6) Commission Decision 2001/597/ECSC of 11 April 2001 (OJ L 210, 3.8.2001, p. 32).\n\n(7) 1 tonne coal equivalent (tec) = 29,302 Gigajoules (GJ).\n\n(8) Confidential information.'}]}"

(2) The experience of recent marketing years shows that the suspension of import duties on a quantity of 400 000 tonnes of sugar per marketing year intended for the production of products referred to in Article 140(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 has been sufficient to guarantee the supply necessary for the manufacture of such products in the Union during the marketing year in question.
(3) In order to give the stakeholders the certainty that supply necessary for the manufacturing of products referred to in Article 140(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be constantly available each marketing year until the end of the quota system, it is appropriate to provide for the suspension of import duties for a certain quantity of sugar for each of the three following marketing years, from 2014/2015 until 2016/2017.
(4) Furthermore, Article 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 891/2009 (2) provides for the administration of the tariff quota for industrial import sugar with order number 09.4390.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (1), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC (2), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(4) The request to recognise that the ‘Gafta Trade Assurance Scheme’ that has been amended with a RED addendum demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was submitted to the Commission on 18 February 2014. The scheme can cover all feedstocks suitable for biofuel production and has a global scope. This scheme covers the trading, transport and storage stages of agricultural feedstock from farm gate to first processor and, for the other stages, relies on other voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission. As such, it is the responsibility of the ‘Gafta Trade Assurance Scheme’ to ensure that the recognition issued by the Commission on those schemes with which it jointly operates remains valid during the length of cooperation. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.
(5) Assessment of the ‘Gafta Trade Assurance Scheme’ including the ‘RED addendum’ found it to cover adequately all the sustainability criteria of Directive 98/70/EC and of Directive 2009/28/EC, except Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC. It does, however, provide accurate data on elements that are required by economic operators downstream the chain of custody to demonstrate compliance with Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC and applies a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(6) The evaluation of the ‘Gafta Trade Assurance Scheme’ including the ‘RED addendum’ found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing.
(7) The ‘Gafta Trade Assurance Scheme’ including the ‘RED addendum’ was assessed against legislation in force at the time of the adoption of this Commission Implementing Decision. In the case of relevant changes in the legal basis the Commission will assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme still adequately covers the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.
(8) In the case of changes in the scheme the Commission will assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.

Whereas the version for 1978 of the abovementioned laws, regulations and administrative provisions were the subject of Commission Decision 78/869/EEC (1);
Whereas the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany also forwarded, pursuant to Article 2 of Commission Decision 74/185/EEC (2) and Article 2 of Decision 78/869/EEC, a report on the application of the principles for the granting of investment aid in individual combined farming and forestry undertakings and in individual forestry undertakings;
Whereas, under Article 18 (3) of Directive 72/159/EEC and Article 9 (3) of Directive 72/160/EEC, the Commission must decide whether, having regard to the compatibility of the provisions notified with those Directives and with Directive 75/268/EEC and to the objectives of the said Directives and to the need for a proper connection between the various measures, the conditions for continued financial contribution by the Community in 1979 are satisfied;
Whereas, subject to the reservation already set out in Decision 74/185/EEC relating to the principles for the granting of investment aid in individual combined farming and forestry undertakings and in individual forestry undertakings, the provisions notified are consistent with the objectives of Directives 72/159/EEC, 72/160/EEC and 75/268/EEC;  (1)OJ No L 297, 24.10.1978, p. 28. (2)OJ No L 94, 4.4.1974, p. 22.
Whereas the report from the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany referred to above showed that in 1978 also less than 1 % of all aided farms received aid under the aforesaid principles, and, consequently, that the measure concerned, which does not comply with the requirements of Article 14 (2) of Directive 72/159/EEC, has only very little practical significance ; whereas the achievement of the objectives of the Directive was therefore hardly at all affected thereby in 1978;
Whereas the Community must, however, remain in a position to ascertain that the measure does not acquire special significance which might endanger the achievement of the objectives of the Directives;
Whereas the EAGGF Committee has been consulted on the financial aspects;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/23/EEC of 31 March 1992 relating to tyres for motor vehicles and their trailers and to their fitting (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/23/EEC is one of the separate Directives of the EC type-approval procedure established by Directive 70/156/EEC.
(2) Directive 92/23/EEC as amended by Directive 2001/43/EC provides the possibility for type-approval authorities to accept tyre manufacturers’ laboratories as approved test laboratories until 31 December 2005. The experience with this provision has been very positive and therefore the possibility should be continued and that deadline should be removed.
(3) Technical progress in the tyre-producing sector is very fast. Due to strong demand from consumers and the car industry, the production cycles of tyres become faster and the variety of tyre types is constantly increasing. This situation is expected to become even more critical in the future since very expensive or unique test installations and expertise will be required. In order to be able to bring the newly developed products on to the market without delay, a sufficient number of test facilities, which can be used in a flexible manner, is indispensable.
(4) In line with the development of superior tyres due to technical progress, the related test procedures need to be more and more sophisticated. There is currently no test capacity outside that of tyre manufacturers that would be able to cope with the high number of tests needed.
(5) Directive 92/23/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 health claims made on food are prohibited unless they are authorised by the Commission in accordance with that Regulation and included in a list of permitted claims.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 also provides that applications for authorisations of health claims may be submitted by food business operators to the national competent authority of a Member State. The national competent authority is to forward valid applications to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), hereinafter referred to as ‘the Authority’.
(3) Following receipt of an application the Authority is to inform without delay the other Member States and the Commission and to deliver an opinion on a health claim concerned.
(4) The Commission is to decide on the authorisation of health claims taking into account the opinion delivered by the Authority.
(5) Following an application from Rudolf Wild GmbH & Co. KG, submitted on 10 June 2008 pursuant to Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Authority was required to deliver an opinion on a health claim related to the effects of Immune Balance Drink on strengthening body’s defences (Question No EFSA-Q-2009-00517) (2). The claim proposed by the applicant was worded, inter alia, as follows: ‘The Immune Balance Drink activates body’s defence’.
(6) On 4 November 2009, the Commission and the Member States received the scientific opinion from the Authority, which concluded that on the basis of the data presented, a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of Immune Balance Drink and the claimed effect. Accordingly, as the claim does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, it should not be authorised.
(7) The comments from the applicant and the members of the public received by the Commission, pursuant to Article 16(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, have been considered when setting the measures provided for in this Regulation.
(8) Health claims referred to in Article 13(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 are subject to the transition measures laid down in Article 28(5) of that Regulation only if they comply with the conditions therein mentioned, among which that they have to comply with the Regulation. As for the claim subject to the present Regulation, the Authority concluded that a cause and effect relationship had not been established between the consumption of the food and the claimed effect and thus it does not comply with the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and it could not benefit from the transition period foreseen in Article 28(5) of that Regulation. A transition period of six months is provided for to enable food business operators to adapt to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for boysenberries, preserved by freezing, not containing added sugar, intended for any form of processing except for the manufacture of jam entirely from boysenberries, falling within subheading ex 08.10 D of the Common Customs Tariff
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Whereas Community supplies of boysenberries currently depend on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to partially suspend the Common Customs Tariff duty for the product in question, within the Community tariff quota, of an appropriate volume; whereas, in order not to bring into question the development of fruit production in the Community while ensuring an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to limit the benefits of the tariff quota to a quantity of 1 500 tonnes, to open the quota for the period 1 January to 31 December 1985 and to fix the quota duty as 15 %;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of duty for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, arrangements for the utilization of the tariff quota based on an allocation among Member States would seem to be consistent with the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to correspond as closely as possible to the actual trend in the market in the product in question, allocation of the quota should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States as calculated by reference to statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, however, since the quota is an autonomous Community tariff quota intended to cover import needs arising in the Community, for experimental purposes, the quota volume may be allocated on the basis of the temporary import needs from third countries expressed by each of the Member States; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, to take account of possible import trends for the product concerned, the quota volume should be divided into two tranches, the first being allocated between certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to meet subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to give importers of the Member States some degree of certainty, the first tranche of the tariff quota should be fixed at a relatively high level, which in this case could be 1 400 tonnes;
Whereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas each time its additional share is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, which latter must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused, it is essential that the Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3567/84 of 18 December 1984 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for boysenberries, preserved by freezing, not containing added sugar, intended for any form of processing except for the manufacture of jam entirely from boysenberries, falling within subheading ex 08.10 D of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Directive 2003/60/EC(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals(3), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/62/EC(4), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin(5), as last amended by Directive 2003/60/EC, and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables(6), as last amended by Directive 2003/69/EC(7), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(8), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/84/EC(9), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For the existing active substances acephate and parathion-methyl, decisions were taken not to include them in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Decisions 2003/219/EC(10) and 2003/166/EC(11) respectively. These Decisions provided that plant protection products containing these active substances shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community.
(2) In order to allow legitimate expectations to be fulfilled for existing stocks of pesticides to be used, the Commission Decisions cited in recital 1, allowed a phasing-out period, and it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community should not apply until the end of the phasing-out period applying to that substance.
(3) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius(12) are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for acephate and parathion-methyl. These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established.
(4) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(5) It is therefore necessary to add all of the pesticide residues arising from use of those plant protection products to the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(6) MRLs for parathion-methyl should be set in Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC. Provisions of Directive 76/895/EEC which set MRLs for that substance should consequently be deleted.
(7) Where no Community MRL or provisional community MRL exists, as is the case for 2,4-D on citrus by Commission Directive 2002/97/EC(13), Member States are to establish a national provisional MRL in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC before plant protection products containing these active substances may be authorised. Data have been submitted by a Member State that demonstrated that a higher MRL can be set for citrus, reflecting the use of 2,4-D in some third countries. Data have been submitted showing that these residues do not pose a risk to consumers in the Community.
(8) The relevant Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Council Decision 97/413/EC of 26 June 1997 concerning the objectives and detailed rules for restructuring the Community fisheries sector for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001 with a view to achieving a balance on a sustainable basis between resources and their exploitation (3) and in particular Article 9(1) thereof,
Whereas Decision 97/413/EC was adopted pursuant to the provisions of Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92 of 20 December 1992 establishing a Community system for fisheries and aquaculture (4), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden;
Whereas Belgium, hereinafter referred to as 'the Member State`, on 30 June 1997, in accordance with Article 6 (1) of Decision 97/413/EC, submitted to the Commission a fishing effort limitation programme for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001, and has supplemented this programme by further information at later dates; whereas Article 9(1) of Decision 97/413/EC provides that the Commission shall adopt the multiannual guidance programmes (MAGP) for the fishing fleets of individual Member States no later than 30 November 1997;
Whereas Article 6(2) of Decision 97/413/EC provides that capacity reductions shall be ensured by the establishment in each Member State of a permanent regime to control the renewal of the fleet, which will determine, segment by segment, the ratio of entries/exits of vessels; whereas the programmes submitted by Member States either contain no information on this issue whatsoever or are unsatisfactory; whereas Member States should therefore communicate the necessary information to the Commission at a later stage;
Whereas Article 7(1) of Decision 97/413/EC provides that the starting point for the objectives fixed for the fishing fleets for 31 December 2001 shall be the fleet objectives fixed by the previous programme for 31 December 1996;
Whereas the objectives fixed by the previous programme should be adjusted in cases where this is justified by new information supplied by the Member State concerned;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 7(2) of Decision 97/413/EC, the particular situation of the fleet of each Member State concerned must be taken into account in fixing the objectives applicable to that fleet;
Whereas Decision 97/413/EC, and in particular Article 9(1) thereof, requires the fixing of annual intermediate targets; whereas since a large part of the first year of the period covered by the programmes will have elapsed at the time of the adoption of the present Decision it is not appropriate to set an intermediate objective for 1997;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 9(1) of Decision 97/413/EC, the Commission shall adopt the detailed rules for the implementation of that Decision; whereas it is useful to clarify certain concepts;
Whereas the starting point for calculating the intermediate and final fleet objectives under MAGP IV are the fleet objectives fixed by the previous programmes for 31 December 1996 (MAGP III); whereas the tonnage objectives set by MAGP III were expressed in gross registered tonnes (GRT), but the MAGP IV objectives must be expressed in units of gross tonnes (GT); whereas not all Member States have submitted GT values for all fishing vessels of the fleet concerned notwithstanding their obligation to measure or estimate the GT of all vessels in their fleet, and to transmit this information to the Commission;
Whereas, in those circumstances, the Commission must, using a practical approach, estimate the missing GT values in order to provisionally determine that Member State's MAGP IV intermediate and final objectives on the basis of those estimates;
Whereas however the Commission cannot accept any claims by Member States that fishing effort and/or capacity has been reduced in as far as they relate to vessels for which the Member State concerned has not fulfilled its obligation to transmit at GT value or estimate to the Commission, since the exact amount of that reduction is not verifiable;
Whereas, in the absence of the required GT tonnage values measured or estimated in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 2930/86 of 22 September 1986 defining the characteristics of fishing vessels (5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3259/94 (6) and implemented by Commission Decision 95/84/EC (7), the Commission will be unable to verify the percentage changes in the fleet capacity or fishing effort represented by changes in the capacity or activity of individual vessels, or by vessel entries or exits to and from the fleet; whereas the Commission will therefore have to assess whether the fishing effort reductions applied to vessels for which the required GT values are available have been sufficient to be almost certain that a Member State has reached its MAGP IV objectives;
Whereas, since the starting point for the MAGP IV objectives are the final MAGP III objectives, a Member State cannot be deemed to have reached either intermediate or final MAGP IV objectives until it has fulfilled its obligations under MAGP III, and in particular the obligation to reach at least 55 % of the MAGP III obligations by reductions in capacity,
Whereas the segmentation of the fleet must take into account the segmentation adopted by the previous programme;
Whereas in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 109/94 of 19 January 1994 concerning the Community register of fishing vessels (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 493/96 (9), each Member State must communicate all changes to the situation of the fishing fleet and the evolution of fishing effort by fishery;

TABLES OF OBJECTIVES\n\nThe tables specifying the applicable reduction objectives can be found at the end of this Annex.\n\nII. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS\n\n1. Identification of segments and fisheries\n\nSegments of the fleet are defined in accordance with Article 1(4) and 4 of Decision 97/413/EC. One or more fisheries may be identified within segments using active gears.\n\nObjectives fixed in terms of fishing effort by fishery are valid provided that the measures to limit fishing effort described in the programme submitted pursuant to Article 6 of Decision 97/413/EC, as approved by the Commission, are respected.\n\nThe objectives fixed must be attained for each of the segments and where applicable for each of the fisheries by the end of the programme.\n\nEach segment of the fleet is allocated a code number by which the segment to which any vessel belongs is recorded in the fishing vessel register of the Community. All changes to the allocation of vessels to segments must be communicated according to the procedures of Regulation (EC) No 109/94.\n\n2. Conversion of tonnage objectives from units of GRT to units of GT\n\nThe objectives of the MAGP III fixed for 31 December 1996 serve as the starting point for the calculation of the objectives of MAGP IV. The tonnage objectives for the MAGP III are converted from units of gross registered tonnes (GRT) to units of GT by the application of the following formula to each of the fleet segments or applicable subdivisions of the fleet segments of MAGP III:\n\nObjective for 31 December 1996 (GT) = objective for 31 December 1996 (GRT) × >NUM>Situation at 31 December 1996 (GT)\n\n>DEN>Situation at 31 December 1996 (GRT)\n\nwhere the situation at 31 December 1996 in GRT incorporates, where necessary, calculations made in accordance with Commission Decision 97/259/EC (1).\n\n3. Calculation of the objectives\n\nThe objectives are expressed in terms of tonnage in GT and power as defined in Regulation (EEC) No 2930/86 in kW.\n\n3.1. Objectives by segment\n\nWhere a segment comprising small coastal vessels has been identified in accordance with Article 3 of Decision 97/413/EC, the objectives fixed by the MAGP IV are to stabilise capacity at its level at 1 January 1997 or, at the choice of the Member State, to limit capacity to a level corresponding to the objectives of the MAGP III for this segment.\n\nThe capacity objectives for 31 December 2001 for all other segments are calculated by applying the appropriate reduction rate to the capacity objectives by segment for 31 December 1996 fixed by the MAGP III. If the vessels in one or more segments of the MAGP III are redistributed into one or more segments of the MAGP IV, the sum of the objectives for 31 December 1996 of the MAGP III segments concerned gives the sum of the objectives for 31 December 1996 of the new MAGP IV segments so created. The objectives of the MAGP IV segments for 31 December 1996 are calculated by partitioning this sum among the MAGP IV segments according to the size of those segments at 31 December 1996.\n\nThe reduction rate applied to each segment is calculated according to the method described in Annex II to Decision 97/413/EC, in which the pilot reduction rate for the segment is multiplied by the proportion of the catch in weight of the segment that is made up of critical stocks.\n\n3.2. Objectives by fishery\n\nWhere distinct fisheries have been identified in one or more segments, and where the programme for the limitation of fishing effort in each of these fisheries submitted in accordance with Article 6 of Decision 97/413/EC has been approved by the Commission, distinct effort reduction rates are calculated for each of the fisheries. The method of calculation of the reduction rate in each fishery is identical to that for capacity reductions by segment.\n\nThe effort objectives by fishery are calculated by applying the appropriate reduction rate to the baseline level of effort for that fishery. The baseline levels of effort for the fisheries in a segment are calculated by partitioning the effort objective for the segment for 31 December 1996 among the fisheries. The effort objective for the segment is given by the product of the capacity objective of the segment for 31 December 1996 and mean activity of vessels in the segment over the reference period agreed with the Commission. The proportion of the effort objective for the segment allocated to each fishery is decided by the Member State subject to approval by the Commission, and is fixed for the duration of the programme.\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the present Decision, the intermediate objectives expressed in terms of fishing effort will be deemed to have been met if the cumulative fishing effort from the start of the programme to the date of the intermediate objective is equal to or less than the cumulative fishing effort that would have been exerted if all the annual intermediate objectives had been met exactly.\n\nWithout prejudice to the provisions of Articles 4 and 5 of the present Decision, the final objectives expressed in terms of fishing effort will be deemed to have been met if the cumulative fishing effort over the period of the programme is equal to or less than the cumulative fishing effort that would have been exerted if all the annual objectives had been met exactly.\n\n3.3. Authorised adjustments to the objectives\n\nMember States may at any time submit to the Commission a programme of safety improvements. In accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Decision 97/413/EC the Commission will decide whether any capacity increase foreseen by such a programme justifies a corresponding increase in the objectives of the MAGP IV.\n\nWhere a Member State implements technical measures that result in a reduction in the by-catch of critical stocks, the Commission will, at the request of that Member State, determine whether these measures justify a revision of the weighted reduction rates applicable to the segments or fisheries concerned.\n\nThe Decisions of the Commission concerning the provisions of this paragraph will be taken according to the procedures of Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3760/92.\n\n3.4. Backlog from the previous programme\n\nWhere the objectives for 31 December 1996 have not been achieved, the backlog in a given segment can be made up by a mixture of capacity and activity reductions, provided that a programme for the reduction of effort is submitted to the Commission for approval in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 109/94 and provided that at least 55 % of the backlog for all segments combined is made up by capacity reductions. The reductions in activity resulting from such a programme have been taken into account in order to establish the baseline activity levels for MAGP IV.\n\n4. Implementation and monitoring\n\nThe implementation of the measures to reduce fishing effort for certain segments of fleet require that evidence is given to the Commission by the Member State that the following are available for each of the segments concerned:\n\n- data concerning activity levels before the entry into force of the measures,\n\n- effective tools to manage time at sea, and an ability to manage fishing licence schemes,\n\n- data making it possible to follow the effect of the measures implemented. These effects have to be controllable by the Commission, in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 (2) relating to control.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n(1) OJ L 104, 22.4.1997, p. 28.\n\n(2) OJ L 261, 20.10.1993, p. 1.'}]}"

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 905/2005
of 16 June 2005
determining for the 2004/2005 marketing year actual production of unginned cotton and the ensuing guide price reduction
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Protocol 4 on cotton (1),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton (2), and in particular the third indent of Article 19(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The first subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme (3) provides that actual production in each marketing year and the reduction in the guide price referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 are to be established before 15 June of that year.
(2) The second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 states the terms on which the quantity of unginned cotton produced is to be reckoned as the actual production.
(3) The Greek authorities, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, have recognised 1 135 534 tonnes of unginned cotton as eligible for aid.
(4) The Greek authorities have informed the Commission that on 15 May 2005 they did not recognise as eligible for aid 34 142 tonnes of unginned cotton consisting of 6 172 tonnes from 2 364,9 hectares not declared in line with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001, 22 746 tonnes in respect of which national area reduction measures under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were disregarded, 3 580 tonnes which were not of sound and fair merchantable quality in accordance with Article 15(1) of that Regulation, and 1 644 tonnes from 2 040 hectares from areas in respect of which financial compensation was paid to the growers on account of damage due to natural causes.
(5) Exclusion from actual production of the abovementioned 1 644 tonnes of unginned cotton is not justified. This quantity comes from parcels declared under Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and was actually delivered to the ginning plants. The very low yield in tonnes of unginned cotton of the parcels affected by the damage is an important indication that the parcels nevertheless generated some produce. Therefore, that quantity meets the criteria laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be added to the quantity of 1 135 534 tonnes.
(6) In consequence, actual Greek production of unginned cotton for the 2004/2005 marketing year must be considered to total 1 137 229 tonnes.
(7) The Spanish authorities, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, have recognised 368 084 tonnes of unginned cotton as eligible for aid.
(8) The Spanish authorities have informed the Commission that on 15 May 2005 they did not recognise as eligible for aid 1 638 tonnes of unginned cotton consisting of 1 612 tonnes in respect of which national area reduction measures under Article 17(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were disregarded, six tonnes that were not of sound and fair merchantable quality in accordance with Article 15(1) of that Regulation, seven tonnes that were not declared in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001, and 13 tonnes because the rules concerning contracts referred to in Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 were not complied with.
(9) Exclusion from actual production of the abovementioned 13 tonnes of unginned cotton on account of non-compliance with the rules concerning contracts is not justified. Moreover, this quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must therefore be added to the quantity of 368 084 tonnes.
(10) In consequence, by application of fibre yield as a quality criterion actual Spanish production of unginned cotton in the 2004/2005 marketing year must be considered to total 368 097 tonnes.
(11) The Spanish authorities, using fibre yield as a quality criterion, have recognised 982 tonnes of unginned cotton from crop areas in Portugal as eligible for aid. This quantity meets the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 16(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 and must accordingly be regarded as actual Portuguese production of unginned cotton for the 2004/2005 marketing year.
(12) Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 provides that if the sum of the actual production determined for Spain and Greece exceeds 1 031 000 tonnes the guide price indicated in Article 3(1) of that Regulation is to be reduced in any Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity.
(13) Moreover, if the sum of actual production in Spain and Greece reduced by 1 031 000 tonnes is higher than 469 000 tonnes, the reduction in the guide price of 50 % increases gradually in accordance with the rules laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001.
(14) For the 2004/05 marketing year the guaranteed national quantity is exceeded in both Spain and Greece. Actual production in Spain is in the second step of 4. 830 tonnes above its guaranteed national quantity increased by 113 000 tonnes. As a result, the guide price reduction in Spain should be 54 %. In the case of Greece, actual production is below its guaranteed national quantity increased by 356 000 tonnes. As a result, the guide price reduction in Greece should be 50 %.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the relevant articles of the Protocols to the Agreements between the European Community, on the one hand, and Morocco (1) and Cyprus (2) on the other, provide for the opening of Community tariff quotas for imports into the Community of the following products originating in each of those countries:
- 100 tonnes of Chinese cabbages, falling within CN code ex 0704 90 90,
- 100 tonnes of 'iceberg' lettuce falling within CN codes ex 0705 11 10 and ex 0705 11 90,
for the period 1 November to 31 December 1989;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 18 of the Protocol in question, these quantities are subject to an annual increase of 5 % from the entry into force of the Protocol, and the quotas in 1989 will accordingly be 110 tonnes;
Whereas, within the limits of Community tariff quotas opened for Morocco, the customs duties are to be abolished progressively over the same periods and in accordance with the same timetables as laid down in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal; whereas for the period 1 November to 31 December 1989 the quota duties are to be equal to 63,6 % and 60 %, respectively, of the basic duties; whereas, within the limits of the Community tariff quotas opened for Cyprus, the customs duties are to be abolished progressively according to the same timetables and under the same conditions as laid down in Articles 5 and 16 of the Protocol relative thereto;
Whereas, however, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988 laying down the arrangements to be applied by Spain and Portugal to trade with Morocco and Syria (3) and the Protocol to the Association Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the Community (4) provide that those two Member States are to postpone implementation of the preferential arrangements for the products in question until 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990, respectively; whereas, consequently, the above tariff quotas apply only to the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985;
Whereas these Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened for the period 1 November to 31 December 1989;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure that all Community importers enjoy equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for those quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas, in the present case, it would appear advisable not to allocate the quotas among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to the procedures specified in Article 3; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 48(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Commission Implementing Decision 2012/274/EU of 24 April 2012 determining the second set of regions for the start of operations of the Visa Information System (VIS) (2), the sixth region where the collection and transmission of data to the VIS for all applications should start comprises Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda; and the seventh region comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
(2) The Member States have notified the Commission that they have made the necessary technical and legal arrangements to collect and transmit the data referred to in Article 5(1) of the VIS Regulation to the VIS for all applications in those two regions, including arrangements for the collection and/or transmission of the data on behalf of another Member State.
(3) The condition laid down by the first sentence of Article 48(3) of the VIS Regulation thus being fulfilled, it is therefore necessary to determine the date from which the VIS is to start operations in a sixth and a seventh region.
(4) In view of the need to set the date for the start of the VIS in the very near future, this Decision should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(5) Given that the VIS Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark notified the implementation of the VIS Regulation in its national law in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community. Denmark is therefore bound under international law to implement this Decision.
(6) This Decision constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis (3).

COMMISSION DECISION
of 26 April 2010
setting up the Expert Group on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law
(2010/233/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Whereas:
(1) The European Council at Tampere in October 1999 requested the Commission to study the need to harmonise legislation in the area of substantive civil law.
(2) The Commission issued a Communication on European contract law (1) in 2001 with the purpose of launching a process of consultation on potential problems and actions in the area of contract law, the responses to which indicated a clear consensus on the need to improve the consistency of the existing Union contract law legislation in order to ensure its uniform application and a smooth functioning of the internal market.
(3) The Commission issued an action plan entitled ‘A more coherent European contract law’ (2) in 2003 which proposed to improve the quality and coherence of Union contract law legislation through the establishment of a Common Frame of Reference, which would provide the Union with a non-binding reference tool containing principles, definitions and model rules to be used for the revision of existing Union legislation and the preparation of new legislation in the area of contract law.
(4) As a preparatory measure, the Commission financed in 2005, through a grant under the 6th Framework Programme for Research, a European academic network of researchers to carry out in-depth legal research which led to an academic Draft Common Frame of Reference (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Draft Common Frame of Reference’).
(5) The Stockholm Programme for 2010-2014 invites the Commission to submit a proposal on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law which should be a non-binding set of fundamental principles, definitions and model rules to be used by the lawmakers at Union level to ensure greater coherence and quality in the lawmaking process.
(6) The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (3) recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for businesses and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other EU countries, inter alia, by making progress towards an optional European Contract Law.
(7) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, and to define its tasks and its structure.
(8) The group should assist the Commission in preparing a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law, including consumer and business contract law, using the Draft Common Frame of Reference as a starting point and taking into consideration other research work conducted in this area as well as the Union acquis. The group should, in particular, help the Commission select those parts of the Draft Common Frame of Reference which are of direct or indirect relevance for contract law, and restructure, revise and supplement the selected contents.
(9) The group should be composed of highly qualified experts with competence in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, appointed in a personal capacity.
(10) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be provided for, without prejudice to the Commission’s rules on security as set out in the Annex to Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom (4).
(11) Personal data relating to members of the group should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5).
(12) It is appropriate to fix a period for the application of this Decision. The Commission will in due time consider the advisability of an extension,","{'header': '27.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 105/109', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 26 April 2010\nsetting up the Expert Group on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law\n(2010/233/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The European Council at Tampere in October 1999 requested the Commission to study the need to harmonise legislation in the area of substantive civil law.\n\n((2)) The Commission issued a Communication on European contract law(1)in 2001 with the purpose of launching a process of consultation on potential problems and actions in the area of contract law, the responses to which indicated a clear consensus on the need to improve the consistency of the existing Union contract law legislation in order to ensure its uniform application and a smooth functioning of the internal market.\n\n((3)) The Commission issued an action plan entitled ‘A more coherent European contract law’(2)in 2003 which proposed to improve the quality and coherence of Union contract law legislation through the establishment of a Common Frame of Reference, which would provide the Union with a non-binding reference tool containing principles, definitions and model rules to be used for the revision of existing Union legislation and the preparation of new legislation in the area of contract law.\n\n((4)) As a preparatory measure, the Commission financed in 2005, through a grant under the 6th Framework Programme for Research, a European academic network of researchers to carry out in-depth legal research which led to an academic Draft Common Frame of Reference (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Draft Common Frame of Reference’).\n\n((5)) The Stockholm Programme for 2010-2014 invites the Commission to submit a proposal on a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law which should be a non-binding set of fundamental principles, definitions and model rules to be used by the lawmakers at Union level to ensure greater coherence and quality in the lawmaking process.\n\n((6)) The Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth(3)recognises the need to make it easier and less costly for businesses and consumers to conclude contracts with partners in other EU countries, inter alia, by making progress towards an optional European Contract Law.\n\n((7)) It is therefore necessary to set up a group of experts in the area of civil law, and in particular contract law, and to define its tasks and its structure.\n\n((8)) The group should assist the Commission in preparing a proposal for a Common Frame of Reference in the area of European contract law, including consumer and business contract law, using the Draft Common Frame of Reference as a starting point and taking into consideration other research work conducted in this area as well as the Unionacquis.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 (2) sets detailed rules covering export refunds on fruit and vegetables.

(3) In line with Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 care should be taken to ensure that trade flows already engendered by the granting of refunds are not disturbed. For that reason and given the seasonal nature of fruit and vegetable exports quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3).

(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 stipulates that when refunds are set account is to be taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability of fruit and vegetables on the Community market and for international trade prices, of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged.
(5) Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 requires Community market prices to be determined using the prices that are most favourable from the point of view of exportation.
(6) The international trade situation or specific requirements of certain markets may necessitate differentiation of the refund on a given product by destination.
(7) Economically significant exports can at present be made of shelled almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts in shell.
(8) Since nuts have a relatively long storage life export refunds can be set at longer intervals.

(3) In line with this Council resolution, the Commission advised that medium- and long-term work should be undertaken in order to adapt Annex III to scientific and technical progress as laid down in Article 8 of Directive 2006/126/EC.
(4) Eyesight, diabetes and epilepsy were identified as being medical conditions affecting fitness to drive which needed to be considered; to that end working groups comprised of specialists appointed by Member States were set up.
(5) These working groups produced reports with a view to updating the relevant points of Annex III to Directive 2006/126/EC.

Where there is reason to doubt that the applicant’s vision is adequate, he/she shall be examined by a competent medical authority. At this examination attention shall be paid, in particular, to the following: visual acuity, field of vision, twilight vision, glare and contrast sensitivity, diplopia and other visual functions that can compromise safe driving.\nFor group 1 drivers, licensing may be considered in “exceptional cases” where the visual field standard or visual acuity standard cannot be met; in such cases the driver should undergo examination by a competent medical authority to demonstrate that there is no other impairment of visual function, including glare, contrast sensitivity and twilight vision. The driver or applicant should also be subject to a positive practical test conducted by a competent authority.\nGroup 1:\n6.1.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence shall have a binocular visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,5 when using both eyes together.\nMoreover, the horizontal visual field should be at least 120 degrees, the extension should be at least 50 degrees left and right and 20 degrees up and down. No defects should be present within a radius of the central 20 degrees.\nWhen a progressive eye disease is detected or declared, driving licences may be issued or renewed subject to the applicant undergoing regular examination by a competent medical authority.\n6.2.\nApplicants for a driving licence, or for the renewal of such a licence, who have total functional loss of vision in one eye or who use only one eye (e.g. in the case of diplopia) must have a visual acuity of at least 0,5, with corrective lenses if necessary. The competent medical authority must certify that this condition of monocular vision has existed for a sufficiently long time to allow adaptation and that the field of vision in this eye meets the requirement laid down in paragraph 6.1.\n6.3.\nAfter any recently developed diplopia or after the loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period (for example, six months), during which driving is not allowed. After this period, driving is only allowed following a favourable opinion from vision and driving experts.\nGroup 2:\n6.4.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence shall have a visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,8 in the better eye and at least 0,1 in the worse eye. If corrective lenses are used to attain the values of 0,8 and 0,1, the minimum acuity (0,8 and 0,1) must be achieved either by correction by means of glasses with a power not exceeding plus eight dioptres, or with the aid of contact lenses. The correction must be well tolerated.\nMoreover, the horizontal visual field with both eyes should be at least 160 degrees, the extension should be at least 70 degrees left and right and 30 degrees up and down. No defects should be present within a radius of the central 30 degrees.\nDriving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers suffering from impaired contrast sensitivity or from diplopia.\nAfter a substantial loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period (for example six months) during which the subject is not allowed to drive. After this period, driving is only allowed after a favourable opinion from vision and driving experts.’;\n2.\npoint 10 is replaced by the following:\n‘DIABETES MELLITUS\n10.\nIn the following paragraphs, a severe hypoglycaemia means that the assistance of another person is needed and a recurrent hypoglycaemia is defined as a second severe hypoglycaemia during a period of 12 months.\nGroup 1:\n10.1.\nDriving licences may be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who have diabetes mellitus. When treated with medication, they should be subject to authorised medical opinion and regular medical review, appropriate to each case, but the interval should not exceed five years.\n10.2.\nDriving licences shall not be issued to, nor renewed for, applicants or drivers who have recurrent severe hypoglycaemia or/and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. A driver with diabetes should demonstrate an understanding of the risk of hypoglycaemia and adequate control of the condition.\nGroup 2:\n10.3.\nConsideration may be given to the issuing/renewal of group 2 licences to drivers with diabetes mellitus. When treated with medication which carries a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (that is, with insulin, and some tablets), the following criteria should apply:\n—\nno severe hypoglycaemic events have occurred in the previous 12 months,\n—\nthe driver has full hypoglycaemic awareness,\n—\nthe driver must show adequate control of the condition by regular blood glucose monitoring, at least twice daily and at times relevant to driving,\n—\nthe driver must demonstrate an understanding of the risks of hypoglycaemia,\n—\nthere are no other debarring complications of diabetes.\nMoreover, in these cases, such licences should be issued subject to the opinion of a competent medical authority and to regular medical review, undertaken at intervals of not more than three years.\n10.4.\nA severe hypoglycaemic event during waking hours, even unrelated to driving, should be reported and should give rise to a reassessment of the licensing status.’;\n3.\npoint 12 is replaced by the following:\n‘EPILEPSY\n12.\nEpileptic seizures or other sudden disturbances of the state of consciousness constitute a serious danger to road safety if they occur in a person driving a power-driven vehicle.\nEpilepsy is defined as having had two or more epileptic seizures, less than five years apart. A provoked epileptic seizure is defined as a seizure which has a recognisable causative factor that is avoidable.\nA person who has an initial or isolated seizure or loss of consciousness should be advised not to drive. A specialist report is required, stating the period of driving prohibition and the requested follow-up.\nIt is extremely important that the person’s specific epilepsy syndrome and seizure type are identified so that a proper evaluation of the person’s driving safety can be undertaken (including the risk of further seizures) and the appropriate therapy instituted. This should be done by a neurologist.\nGroup 1:\n12.1.\nDrivers assessed under group 1 with epilepsy should be under licence review until they have been seizure-free for at least five years.\nIf the person has epilepsy, the criteria for an unconditional licence are not met. Notification should be given to the licensing authority.\n12.2.\nProvoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a provoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking factor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to drive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion (the assessment should be, if appropriate, in accordance with other relevant sections of Annex III (e.g. in the case of alcohol or other co-morbidity).\n12.3.\nFirst or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a first unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive after a period of six months without seizures, if there has been an appropriate medical assessment. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner.\n12.4.\nOther loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be assessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving.\n12.5.\nEpilepsy: drivers or applicants can be declared fit to drive after a one-year period free of further seizures.\n12.6.\nSeizures exclusively in sleep: the applicant or driver who has never had any seizures other than seizures during sleep can be declared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for a period which must not be less than the seizure-free period required for epilepsy. If there is an occurrence of attacks/seizure arising while awake, a one-year period free of further event before licensing is required (see “Epilepsy”).\n12.7.\nSeizures without influence on consciousness or the ability to act: the applicant or driver who has never had any seizures other than seizures which have been demonstrated exclusively to affect neither consciousness nor cause any functional impairment can be declared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for a period which must not be less than the seizure-free period required for epilepsy. If there is an occurrence of any other kind of attacks/seizures a one-year period free of further event before licensing is required (see “Epilepsy”).\n12.8.\nSeizures because of a physician-directed change or reduction of anti-epileptic therapy: the patient may be advised not to drive from the commencement of the period of withdrawal and thereafter for a period of six months after cessation of treatment. Seizures occurring during physician-advised change or withdrawal of medication require three months off driving if the previously effective treatment is reinstated.\n12.9.\nAfter curative epilepsy surgery: see “Epilepsy”.\nGroup 2:\n12.10.\nThe applicant should be without anti-epileptic medication for the required period of seizure freedom. An appropriate medical follow-up has been done. On extensive neurological investigation, no relevant cerebral pathology was established and there is no epileptiform activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG and an appropriate neurological assessment should be performed after the acute episode.\n12.11.\nProvoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a provoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking factor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to drive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion. An EEG and an appropriate neurological assessment should be performed after the acute episode.\nA person with a structural intra-cerebral lesion who has increased risk of seizures should not be able to drive vehicles of group 2 until the epilepsy risk has fallen to at least 2\xa0% per annum. The assessment should be, if appropriate, in accordance with other relevant sections of Annex III (e.g. in the case of alcohol).\n12.12.\nFirst or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a first unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive once five years’ freedom from further seizures has been achieved without the aid of anti-epileptic drugs, if there has been an appropriate neurological assessment. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner.\n12.13.\nOther loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be assessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving. The risk of recurrence should be 2\xa0% per annum or less.\n12.14.\nEpilepsy: 10 years freedom from further seizures shall have been achieved without the aid of anti-epileptic drugs. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner. This also applies in case of “juvenile epilepsy”.\nCertain disorders (e.g. arterio-venous malformation or intra-cerebral haemorrhage) entail an increased risk of seizures, even if seizures have not yet occurred. In such a situation an assessment should be carried out by a competent medical authority; the risk of having a seizure should be 2\xa0% per annum or less to allow licensing.’'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 2006/74/EC (2) included dichlorprop-P as active substance in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC (3), under the condition that the Member States concerned ensure that the notifier at whose request dichlorprop-P was included in that Annex provide further confirmatory information on animal metabolism and the risk assessment on acute and short-term exposure for birds and on acute exposure for herbivorous mammals.
(2) Active substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and are listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (4).
(3) The notifier submitted additional information with a view to confirm the risk assessment for birds and mammals for the use in cereals, grassland and grass seed crops to the rapporteur Member State Denmark within the time period provided for its submission.
(4) Denmark assessed the additional information submitted by the notifier. It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter ‘the Authority’, on 22 July 2011.
(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of dichlorprop-P on 13 November 2012 (5).
(6) In the light of the additional information provided by the notifier, the Commission considered that the further confirmatory information required had not fully been provided and that a high risk for birds and mammals could not be excluded except by imposing further restrictions.
(7) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for dichlorprop-P.
(8) It is confirmed that the active substance dichlorprop-P is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. In order to minimise the exposure of birds and mammals, it is, however, appropriate to further restrict the uses of this active substance and to provide for specific risk mitigation measures for the protection of those species.
(9) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(4) During the past weeks Italy has informed the Commission of a significant increase in numbers and territorial extension of outbreaks of African swine fever in seven out of eight provinces of Sardinia, affecting also large commercial pig holdings.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 2451/95 (2) the Commission initiated an investigation concerning the circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2861/93 (3) on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5&Prime; microdisks) originating in Japan, Taiwan and the People's Republic of China by the same product from Canada, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Macao, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and instructed customs authorities, pursuant to Articles 13 (3) and 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 to register the imports covered by the investigation. The investigation was initiated following a request lodged by the Committee of European Diskette Manufacturers (Diskma).
(2) The request contained prima facie evidence of a change in the pattern of trade between the countries concerned and the Community which sole due cause or justification was the existence of anti-dumping duties, and of transhipments through these countries to the Community of 3,5&Prime; microdisks manufactured in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The request also showed that the imports from the countries concerned were being dumped in relation to the normal values previously established and were undermining the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of 3,5&Prime; microdisks originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. This evidence was considered to be sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.
(3) The product concerned is 3,5&Prime; microdisks, used to record and store encoded digital computer information, currently classifiable within CN code ex 8523 20 90.
(4) The Commission officially advised the exporters known to be concerned and the representatives of the exporting countries about the initiation of the investigation and sent questionnaires to known exporters.
(5) The investigation covered the period 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995.

C. RESULTS
Canada, India, Philippines and Singapore
(7) The Community industry alleged in its request to initiate the circumvention investigation that the combined market share of Canada, India, Philippines and Singapore was 4,5 % of Community consumption in 1994. However, based on the latest external trade statistics of the Community (Comext), the Commission established that the market share of these countries only amounted to 2,8 % during the investigation period, and thus it was less than the de minimis import volume referred to in Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 for which injury shall normally be regarded as negligible. Furthermore, it was established that the imported quantities from these countries were also below the de minimis thresholds of Article 5 (8) of the Agreement on Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994 of 3 % of total imports of the like product into the Community on a per country basis, and of 7 % for all four countries taken together.
(8) On this basis, the Commission considered it unlikely in this case that the imports from the four countries concerned could undermine in terms of quantities the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.
Hong Kong
(9) Jackin Magnetic and Plantron (HK) were found to be genuine producers of microdisks which accounted for about 90 % of total Hong Kong's export volume to the Community during the investigation period. No evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of these two companies. Furthermore, it was established that for each company the parts imported from the countries subject to the anti-dumping duties constituted less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product.
(10) Hong Kong Magnetic is a trading company which sold microdisks to the Community. However, no evidence of transhipments to the Community of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of this company.
(11) Benelux Manufacturing and its subsidiary Prime Standard were found to be related to the Indonesian producer/exporter P. T. Beneluxindo (see recital 14) and to have sold microdisks to the Community. However, no evidence of transhipments to the Community of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of these two companies in Hong Kong.
(12) Another company which was related to the Thai exporter V-SA Magnetic, refused to cooperate in the investigation (see recital 18). The Commission services will continue to monitor closely the situation in this respect.
(13) In view of these findings, it was established that the companies investigated did not fulfil the criteria set out in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 according to which imports of the product concerned transhipped through or assembled in third countries respectively could be considered to constitute circumvention. Furthermore, in view of the development of the imports of microdisks from Hong Kong into the Community which decreased from 2 816 tonnes in 1993 to 1 212 tonnes during the investigation period, it seems unlikely that these imports could undermine in terms of quantities the remedial effects of the anti-dumping duties imposed on the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.
Indonesia
(14) The sole exporter/producer investigated in Indonesia, P. T. Beneluxindo, accounted for the vast majority of the recorded imports into the Community during the investigation period. P. T. Beneluxindo is a subsidiary of Benelux Manufacturing Limited, Hong Kong which supplied P. T. Beneluxindo with all the parts used for the assembly of microdisks. All finished microdisks were then sent back to Hong Kong and sold from there by the sales subsidiary of Benelux Manufacturing Limited, Prime Standard Ltd, to independent customers in the Community. The company was found to be a genuine producer and it was established that the parts imported from the People's Republic of China and Taiwan constituted far less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product. Furthermore, no evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of P. T. Beneluxindo.
Therefore, the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated.
Macao
(15) No company in Macao cooperated in the investigation. In these circumstances the Commission would normally be entitled to propose the extension of the anti-dumping measures to this country in order to avoid that circumvention continues. However, following an investigation by the anti-fraud services of the Commission (Uclaf), anti-dumping duties will be applied retroactively on imports of Chinese microdisks exported from Macao. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures will not be significantly undermined by imports from Macao, the quantities which have fallen sharply following the anti-circumvention investigation period. In any event, the Commission will continue to monitor closely the development of imports into the Community of microdisks from Macao.
Malaysia
(16) The three exporters/producers investigated in Malaysia accounted for nearly all the recorded imports from this country into the Community during the investigation period. While two of these producers were not related to any exporter/producer in the countries subject to the anti-dumping duties, the third one (Mega High-Tech Corp.) was a subsidiary of a Taiwanese company. All three were found to be genuine producers and it was established that the parts imported from the People's Republic of China and Taiwan constituted far less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the product assembled by each producer. Moreover, no evidence of transhipments of the finished product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect of any of the Malaysian producers concerned.
Consequently the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated.
Thailand
(17) The three companies investigated in Thailand accounted for the vast majority of all the recorded imports into the Community from this country during the investigation period. The subsidiary of V-SA Cast, V-SA magnetic (see recital 6 (h)), and General Mediatech were found to be genuine producers and the parts of Chinese or Taiwanese origin used in the assembly of microdisks constituted less than 60 % of the total value of the parts of the assembled product by each of these companies. In addition, no evidence of transhipment of the finished product from the People's Republic of China or Taiwan was found in respect to these two companies.
(18) V-SA Cast was found to have transhipped 28 million microdisks supplied by a company located in Hong Kong which held 15 % of V-SA Magnetic shares. However, given the lack of cooperation of the related company in Hong Kong, no evidence could be found which indicated that the microdisks concerned were of Chinese or Taiwanese origin. The presumption of such origin would seem to be excessively punitive for the Thai company, taking account of its efforts to persuade the Hong Kong company to cooperate in the investigation and the small shareholding by this latter company in the V-SA group.
In view of the above the Commission considers that the conditions for circumvention outlined in Article 13 (1) and (2) (b) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 have not been met in respect of the companies investigated.
D. TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION
(19) In the light of the above findings and considerations made in respect of the nine countries subject to the circumvention investigation, it appears appropriate that the latter be terminated without extension to any of those countries of the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of microdisks originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The registration of imports of microdisks from these countries introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2451/95 shall cease.
(20) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE 2012/52/EU
of 20 December 2012
laying down measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in another Member State
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare (1), and in particular points (a), (c) and (d) of Article 11(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU, the Commission has an obligation to adopt measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in a Member State other than the Member State where the prescriptions are dispensed.
(2) Pursuant to point (a) of Article 11(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU, the Commission is to adopt a non-exhaustive list of elements to be included in those prescriptions. That list should enable the dispensing health professional to verify the authenticity of the prescription and whether it was issued by a member of a regulated health profession who is legally entitled to do so.
(3) The elements to be included in the prescriptions should facilitate the correct identification of medicinal products or medical devices as referred to in point (c) of Article 11 (2) of Directive 2011/24/EU.
(4) Medicinal products should therefore be indicated using the common name in order to facilitate the correct identification of products which are marketed under different brand names across the Union and of products that are not marketed in all Member States. That common name to be used should be either the International Non-proprietary name recommended by the World Health Organisation or, if such name does not exist, the usual common name. In contrast, the brand name of a medicinal product should only be used to ensure clear identification of biological medicinal products as defined in point 3.2.1.1.(b) of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community Code relating to medicinal products for human use (2), because of the special characteristics of those products, or of other medicinal products in cases where the prescribing professional considers it medically necessary.
(5) Medical devices do not have common names as medicinal products. Therefore the prescription should also include direct contact details of the prescriber which enable the dispensing professional, where necessary, to enquire about the prescribed medical device and correctly identify it.
(6) The non-exhaustive list of elements to appear on the prescriptions should facilitate the comprehensibility of the information to patients concerning the prescription and the instructions included on the use of the product, as referred to in point (d) of Article 11(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU. The Commission will regularly review the situation in order to assess whether additional measures are necessary to help patients understand the instructions concerning the use of the product.
(7) To enable patients to request appropriate prescriptions, it is important that national contact points referred to in Article 6 of Directive 2011/24/EU provide patients with adequate information on the content and purpose of the non-exhaustive list of elements that should appear in those prescriptions.
(8) As the overall impact of cross-border healthcare is limited, the non-exhaustive list of elements should apply only to prescriptions intended to be used in another Member State.
(9) As the principle of mutual recognition of prescriptions derives from Article 56 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, this Directive does not preclude the Member States from applying the principle of mutual recognition to prescriptions that do not contain the elements set out in the non-exhaustive list. At the same time, nothing in this Directive prevents the Member States from providing that prescriptions drafted on their territory, with a view to be used in another Member State, contain additional elements that are provided for under the rules applicable on their territory, as long as these rules are compatible with Union law.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 16(1) of Directive 2011/24/EU","{'header': '22.12.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 356/68', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE 2012/52/EU\nof 20 December 2012\nlaying down measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in another Member State\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU, the Commission has an obligation to adopt measures to facilitate the recognition of medical prescriptions issued in a Member State other than the Member State where the prescriptions are dispensed.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to point (a) of Article 11(2) of Directive 2011/24/EU, the Commission is to adopt a non-exhaustive list of elements to be included in those prescriptions.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 27 April 2009
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece
(2009/415/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Greece,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of the said Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that in particular the economic and budgetary background was taken fully into account in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in Greece. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Greece on 24 March 2009 (3).
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Greece, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(7) The general government deficit in Greece reached 3,5 % of GDP in 2007, thus exceeding the 3 % of GDP reference value. According to the Commission services' January 2009 interim forecast, the general government deficit net of one-offs is estimated at 3,6 % of GDP in 2008 (or 3,4 % of GDP including one-offs). This estimation is based on a real GDP growth rate of 2,9 % in 2008 and takes account of the latest information on the execution of the 2008 Budget Law. For 2009, the Commission services' January 2009 interim forecast projects the general government deficit net of one-offs at 4,4 % of GDP (3,7 % including one-off revenues) based on a real GDP growth projection of 0,2 % and on the basis of a prudent assessment of the 2009 Budget Law approved by Parliament on 21 December. Based on the customary unchanged policy assumption and assuming the discontinuation of one-off measures, the 2010 deficit is projected at 4,2 % of GDP. Therefore, the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) General government gross debt stood at 94,8 % of GDP in 2007 and 94,6 % of GDP in 2008, well above the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value. According to the Commission services' January 2009 interim forecast, the general government debt ratio is projected to increase further to 96,25 % in 2009 and 98,5 % of GDP by 2010. The current deficit levels and estimates of medium-term growth are not compatible with a debt ratio converging to a level below 60 % of GDP. The debt ratio cannot be considered as diminishing sufficiently and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.
(9) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) if the double condition – that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary – is fully met. In the case of Greece, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '30.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 135/21', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 27 April 2009\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Greece\n(2009/415/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

Whereas equal and continuous access to the quotas should be ensured for all importers and the rates laid down for the quotas should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question until the quotas are exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, allocation of the tariff quotas among the Member States would seem to preserve the Community nature of the quotas; whereas in order to correspond as closely as possible to the real trend of the market for the products in question the allocation should reflect the requirements of the Member States based on statistics of imports of the said products from Norway during a representative reference period and on the economic outlook for the quota year in question;
Whereas during the last three years for which statistics are available imports into the Member States from Norway were as follows:

(1) OJ No L 328, 22. 11. 1986, p. 76.
Whereas, during the years under consideration, the products in question were imported only by certain Member States and not at all by the other Member States; whereas, under these circumstances, initial shares should be allocated to the importing Member States and the other Member States should be guaranteed access to the benefit of the tariff quotas when imports into those States of the products concerned are notified; whereas these allocation arrangements will ensure the uniform application of the applicable customs duties;
Whereas, in view of these factors, the initial percentage shares of the quota volumes can be expressed approximately as follows:
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  // Member State  // ex 0305 51 10 0305 59 11   // ex 0305 51 90 0305 59 19   // ex 0305 62 00 0305 69 10   //    //   //   //   // Benelux   // 1,78  // 1,82   // 0,02   // Denmark   // 0,02   // 0,02   // 9,14  // Germany   // 1,01   // 2,78   // 0,01   // Greece   // 0,71   // 1,42   // 4,41   // Spain   // -   // -   // 9,44  // France   // 0,82   // 21,39   // 9,63   // Ireland   // -  // -   // -   // Italy   // 95,08   // 21,74   // 23,14  // Portugal   // -   // 50,80   // 44,15   // United Kingdom  // 0,58   // 0,03   // 0,06   //    //   //   //
Whereas, to allow for the trend of imports of the products concerned in the various Member States, each of the quota volumes should be divided into the parts, the first being allocated among certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to cover any subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares and any requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to afford importers in each Member State some degree of certainty, an appropriate level for the first part of the Community quotas would, in the present circumstances, be 75 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to avoid any break in the continuity of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up one of its initial shares should draw an additional share from the corresponding reserve; whereas each time one of its additional shares is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas each of the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must be able to monitor the extent to which the quota volumes have been used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of one of a Member State's initial shares remains unused, it is essential that the Member State concerned should return a significant proportion thereof to the corresponding reserve in order to prevent part of one of the Community tariff quotas from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 249/88 of 25 January 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for cod and fish of the species Boreogadus saida, dried, salted or in brine, originating in Norway (1988)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Articles 1(2) and 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1351/86 (2), and in particular Article 27 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas table grapes are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas table grapes harvested during a given crop year are marketed from May to April of the next year; whereas the quantities harvested in May and June, during the first 20 days of July and also January to April of the next year are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these periods; whereas, due principally to developments in production techniques, a relatively large increase in the marketing of Community products during the last 10 days of November and in the month of December can be expected; whereas, however, the figures at present available are insufficiently conclusive to justify fixing a reference price for that period; whereas, reference prices should be fixed only for the period 21 July to 20 November inclusive;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 140 (2) and 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Spanish and Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first phase in the case of Spain and during the first stage in the case of Portugal;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 (2) lays down rules concerning the increased level of official controls to be carried out on imports of feed and food of non-animal origin listed in Annex I thereto, at the points of entry into the territories referred to in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(2) Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 provides that the list in Annex I thereto is to be reviewed on a regular basis, and at least quarterly, taking into account at least the sources of information referred to in that Article.
(3) Occurrence and relevance of food incidents notified through the Rapid Alert System for Feed and Food (RASFF), findings of the various missions to third countries carried out by the Food and Veterinary Office, as well as the quarterly reports which the Member States have submitted to the Commission in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 indicate that there is a need to review the list in Annex I to that Regulation.
(4) In particular, Annex I thereto must be reviewed by decreasing the control frequency of those commodities for which the above information sources show an overall improvement of compliance with the relevant Union legislation and for which the current level of official control is no longer justified, and by increasing the control frequency of other commodities for which the same sources show a higher degree of non-compliance with the relevant Union legislation that warrants the increase of the level of official controls.

Whereas the information provided by Germany shows that the technology and principle embodied in these new types of gas discharge lamps and headlamps do not meet the requirements of Community regulations; whereas, however, the descriptions of the tests, the results thereof and the action taken in order to ensure road safety are satisfactory and ensure a level of safety equivalent to that of the lamps and headlamps covered by the requirements of the Directives in force and, in particular, of Council Directive 76/761/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to motor-vehicle headlamps which function as main-beam and/or dippedbeam headlamps and to incandescent electric filament lamps for such headlamps (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 89/517/EEC (4);

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001 laying down detailed rules for applying the cotton aid scheme (3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 41/2009

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses (1), and in particular Article 2(3) and Article 4a thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 89/398/EEC concerns foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses which owing to their special composition or manufacturing process are intended to satisfy the particular nutritional requirements of specific categories of the population. People with coeliac disease are such a specific group of the population suffering from a permanent intolerance to gluten.
(2) The food industry has developed a range of products presented as ‘gluten-free’ or similar equivalent terms. Differences between national provisions concerning the conditions for the use of such product descriptions may impede the free movement of the concerned products and may fail to ensure the same high level of protection for consumers. For the sake of clarity and in order to avoid confusing consumers with different types of product descriptions at national level, the conditions for the use of the terms related to the absence of gluten should be laid down at Community level.
(3) Wheat (i.e. all Triticum species, such as durum wheat, spelt, and kamut), rye and barley, have been identified as grains that are scientifically reported to contain gluten. The gluten present in those grains can cause adverse health effects to persons intolerant to gluten and therefore should be avoided by them.
(4) The removal of gluten from gluten-containing grains presents considerable technical difficulties and economic constraints and therefore the manufacture of totally gluten-free food is difficult. Consequently, many foodstuffs for this particular nutritional use on the market may contain low residual amounts of gluten.
(5) Most but not all people with intolerance to gluten can include oats in their diet without adverse effect on their health. This is an issue of ongoing study and investigation by the scientific community. However, a major concern is the contamination of oats with wheat, rye or barley that can occur during grain harvesting, transport, storage and processing. Therefore, the risk of gluten contamination in products containing oats should be taken into consideration with regard to labelling of those products.
(6) Different people with intolerance to gluten may tolerate variable small amounts of gluten within a restricted range. In order to enable individuals to find on the market a variety of foodstuffs appropriate for their needs and for their level of sensitivity, a choice of products should be possible with different low levels of gluten within such a restricted range. It is important, however, that the different products should be properly labelled in order to ensure the correct use of those products by people intolerant to gluten with the support of information campaigns fostered in the Member States.
(7) Foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses which have been specially formulated, processed or prepared to meet the dietary needs of people intolerant to gluten and marketed as such should be labelled either as ‘very low gluten’ or ‘gluten-free’ in accordance with the provisions laid down in this Regulation. These provisions can be achieved by the use of foodstuffs which have been specially processed to reduce the gluten content of one or more gluten containing ingredients and/or foodstuffs where the gluten containing ingredients have been substituted by other ingredients naturally free of gluten.
(8) Article 2(3) of Directive 89/398/EEC provides for the possibility for foodstuffs for normal consumption which are suitable for a particular nutritional use to indicate such suitability. Therefore, it should be possible for a normal food which is suitable as part of a gluten-free diet because it does not contain ingredients derived from gluten containing grains or oats to bear terms indicating the absence of gluten. Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (2), requires that such a statement does not mislead the consumer by suggesting that the food possesses special characteristics when in fact all similar foodstuffs possess such characteristics.
(9) Commission Directive 2006/141/EC of 22 December 2006 on infant formulae and follow-on formulae and amending Directive 1999/21/EC (3), prohibits the use of ingredients containing gluten in the manufacture of such foodstuffs. Therefore, the use of the terms ‘very low gluten’ or ‘gluten-free’ on the labelling of such products should be prohibited given that pursuant to the present Regulation, this labelling is used for indicating respectively a content of gluten not exceeding 100 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg.
(10) Commission Directive 2006/125/EC of 5 December 2006 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children (4) requires the indication of the presence or the absence of gluten when the product is intended for infants below six months of age. The absence of gluten in those products should be indicated in accordance with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
(11) The Codex Standard for Foods for Special Dietary Use for Persons Intolerant to Gluten was adopted by the 31st session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission in July 2008 (5), with a view to enabling those persons to find on the market a variety of food suitable to their needs and to their level of sensitivity to gluten. That standard should be taken appropriately into consideration for the purposes of this Regulation.
(12) In order to allow the economic operators to adapt their production process, the date of application of the present Regulation should allow the necessary transitional period. However products which at the date of entry into force of this Regulation already comply with it can be marketed in the Community as from the date of entry into force of the present Regulation.

on the approval of amendments to the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries allowing for the establishment of dispute settlement procedures, the extension of the scope of the Convention and a review of the objectives of the Convention
(2009/550/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37, in conjunction with Article 300(2) and the first subparagraph of Article 300(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (the Convention), was signed in London on 18 November 1980 and entered into force on 17 March 1982.
(2) The Community acceded to the Convention on 13 July 1981 (2).
(3) According to Article 19(2) of the Convention the adoption of an amendment to the Convention requires a three-fourths majority of all Contracting Parties. In accordance with Article 19(3) of the Convention, an amendment will take effect 120 days following the date of notification by the Depositary of receipt of written notification of approval by three-fourths of all Contracting Parties.
(4) The Contracting Parties to the Convention adopted an amendment to the Convention at the 23rd Annual Meeting of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) in November 2004 allowing NEAFC to adopt recommendations establishing procedures for the settlement of disputes arising from the Convention.
(5) By postal vote on 11 August 2006 the Contracting Parties to the Convention adopted an amendment to the Convention whereby the scope of the Convention was extended so as to include sedentary species and the objectives of the Convention were broadened. The Convention was also amended so as to mention developments in other international forums for fisheries management that affect fisheries in the NEAFC Convention area, and certain new definitions were introduced.
(6) Sedentary species are harvested or affected by fisheries and it is therefore appropriate to include those species in the scope of the Convention.
(7) The Convention provides that NEAFC shall perform its functions in the interest of the conservation and optimum utilisation of fishery resources. In addition to these objectives, it is important to underline the importance of long-term management and that the management of fishery resources should provide sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits. It is therefore appropriate to include these elements as objectives in the Convention.
(8) According to the Convention, NEAFC shall, in performing its functions, take account of the best scientific evidence available to it. In fulfilling the objectives, it is also important to take into account the precautionary approach, the ecosystem approach and the need to conserve marine biological diversity. It is therefore appropriate that NEAFC also take these elements into account in performing its functions.
(9) A dispute settlement procedure established under the Convention should enable the expeditious settlement of disputes, which would be in the interest of the Community.
(10) Furthermore, such a procedure would help towards the strengthening and modernisation of regional fisheries management organisations, in particular the NEAFC, and thereby ensure the long-term sustainability of the fisheries in the North-East Atlantic.
(11) In the light of the fishing possibilities accruing to the Community under the Convention, it is therefore in the Community’s interest to approve the proposed amendments,","{'header': '16.7.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 184/12', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 5 March 2009\non the approval of amendments to the Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries allowing for the establishment of dispute settlement procedures, the extension of the scope of the Convention and a review of the objectives of the Convention\n(2009/550/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in the North-East Atlantic Fisheries (the Convention), was signed in London on 18 November 1980 and entered into force on 17 March 1982.\n\n((2)) The Community acceded to the Convention on 13 July 1981(2).\n\n((3)) According to Article 19(2) of the Convention the adoption of an amendment to the Convention requires a three-fourths majority of all Contracting Parties.

of 18 June 2003

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Protocol 2 to the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and Lithuania, approved by Decision 98/150/EC, ECSC, Euratom of the Council and the Commission of 19 December 1997 on the conclusion of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Lithuania, of the other part(1), provides for tariff concessions for processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania. Protocol 2 was amended by the Protocol adjusting the Europe Agreement, hereinafter referred to as the ""Adjusting Protocol"", approved by Council Decision 98/677/EC(2), and by Decision No 5/2001 of the EU-Lithuania Association Council(3).
(2) A trade agreement has recently been concluded which amends the Adjusting Protocol. The agreement aims to improve economic convergence in preparation for the accession of Lithuania to the European Union and is scheduled to enter into force not later than 1 July 2003. On the Community side that agreement lays down concessions in the form of complete liberalisation of trade for certain processed agricultural products and duty-free quotas for others. For imports outside of those quotas the provisions laid down in Protocol 2 continue to apply.
(3) The procedure for adopting a decision to amend the Adjusting Protocol will not be completed in time for it to enter into force on 1 July 2003. It is therefore necessary to provide for the application of the tariff concessions made to Lithuania on an autonomous basis as from 1 July 2003.
(4) For the imports of certain agricultural products no duties should be applied and for others duty-free quotas should be opened.
(5) On processed agricultural products covered by Protocol 2 but not listed in this regulation or for which the quotas opened by this Regulation are exhausted the trade provision laid down in Protocol 2 should continue to apply.
(6) Processed agricultural products not covered by Annex I to the Treaty should not be eligible for export refunds under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(4).
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5) provides for a system for managing tariff quotas. The tariff quotas opened by this Regulation should be managed by the Community authorities and the Member States in accordance with that system.
(8) The measures necessary to implement this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 July 2003 no duties shall be applied on imports of processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania listed in Annex I.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Annex II shall be open for 2003 from 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2003 and for 2004 under the conditions laid down therein.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nProcessed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Lithuania shall not be eligible for export refunds under Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nFor processed agricultural products which are not covered by Annex I and Annex II or for which the quotas referred to in Annex II are exhausted, the provisions laid down in Protocol 2 shall apply.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\nThe Commission may suspend the measures provided for in Articles 1, 2 and 3 in case of non-application of the reciprocal preferences agreed by Lithuania, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 7(2).'}, {'id': '6', 'title': 'Article 6', 'text': 'Article 6\n\nThe tariff quotas referred to in Annex II shall be managed by the Commission in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.'}, {'id': '7', 'title': 'Article 7', 'text': 'Article 7\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) N° 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical  nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) N° 950/68 of 28 June 1968 on the Common Customs Tariff (2), as  last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 3529/87 (3), established the Common Customs Tariff on the basis  of the nomenclature of the Convention of 15 December 1950 concerning the nomenclature to be used  for the classification of goods in customs tariffs;
Whereas on the basis of Council Regulation (EEC) N° 97/69 of 16 January 1969 on measures to be  taken for the
uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff (4), as last  amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 2055/84 (5), Commission Regulation (EEC) N° 1120/75 (6), as last  amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 3391/83 (7), determined the conditions for the entry of port,  Madeira, sherry, Setubal muscatel and Tokay (Aszu and Szamorodni) wines falling within subheadings  22.05 C III
a) 1, 22.05 C III b) 1, 22.05 C III b) 2, and 22.05 C IV a) 1
and b) 1 and 2 of the  Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) N° 2658/87 has repealed and replaced, on the one hand, Regulation (EEC) N°  950/68 in adopting the new tariff and statistical nomenclature (combined nomenclature) based on the  International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System and, on the  other hand, Regulation (EEC) N° 97/69; whereas it is consequently appropriate, for reasons of  clarity, to replace Regulation (EEC) N° 1120/75 by a new regulation taking over the new  nomenclature as well as the new legal base; whereas, for the same reasons, it is appropriate to  incorporate in this new text all the amendments made to date;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) N° 2658/87 covers
- port, Madeira, sherry and Setubal muscatel  wines falling within subheadings 2204 21 41 and 2204 21 51, and
- Tokay (Aszu and Szamorodni) wine  falling within subheadings 2204 29 45 and 2204 29 55;
- port, Madeira, sherry and Setubal Muscatel wines falling within subheadings 2204 29 41 and 2204  29 51
of the combined nomenclature;
Whereas entry under these subheadings is subject to conditions laid down in the relevant Community  provisions; whereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature,  provisions specifying those conditions must be laid down;
Whereas identification of the above wines presents certain difficulties; whereas it can be  considerably simplified if the exporting country gives an assurance that the product exported  corresponds to the description of the product in question; whereas, consequently, entry of a  product under the subheadings mentioned above should be authorized only where such product is  accompanied by a certificate of designation of origin which is issued by an authority acting under  the responsibility of the exporting country and which provides such assurance;
Whereas it is appropriate to specify the form which such certificates must take and the conditions  for their use; whereas, furthermore, measures must be introduced to enable the Community to keep  check upon the conditions of issue of the said certificates and to prevent falsification; whereas  accordingly certain obligations should be imposed on the issuing authority;
Whereas the certificate of authenticity should be drawn up in one of the official Community  languages and, where appropriate, an official language of the exporting country;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(2), second subparagraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(2) The European Commission was recently made aware that high levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China. Melamine is a chemical intermediate used in the manufacture of amino resins and plastics and is used as a monomer and as an additive for plastics. High levels of melamine in food can result in very severe health effects.
(3) Imports of milk and milk products, including milk powder, originating from China are not allowed into the Community; however, certain composite products (i.e. products which contain at the same time a processed product of animal origin and a product of non-animal origin) containing processed milk components might have reached the European Union's markets.
(4) Although factual information available indicates that no composite products are imported which are intended for the particular nutritional uses of infants or young children, certain such composite products, depending of their specific formulation and in particular on the proportion of milk product content, could have been presented for import without undergoing systematic border checks pursuant to Commission Decision 2007/275/EC of 17 April 2007 concerning lists of animals and products to be subject to controls at border inspection posts under Council Directives 91/496/EEC and 97/78/EC (2). Taking into account that such products represent the primary, and in some cases sole, source of nourishment for infants and young children, it is appropriate to prohibit the import into the Community of any such products originating from China. Member States should ensure that any such products which were to be found on the market should be destroyed without delay.
(5) As regards other composite products (such as biscuits and chocolate), which are only a minor part of a varied diet, after a request from the European Commission for an assessment of the risks related to the presence of melamine in composite product, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued a statement in which it concludes that the highest risk would be represented by a worst case scenario according to which children with high daily consumption of biscuits and chocolate containing the highest proportion of milk powder (which varies between 16 % and more than 20 %), with a contamination equal to the highest level found in milk powder from China, could potentially exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of melamine (0,5 mg/kg body weight).
(6) In order to counter the risk for health that may result from exposure to the melamine content of such composite products, Member States are required under Commission Decision 2008/757/EC (3) to ensure that all composite products containing at least 15 % of milk product, originating from China, are systematically tested before import into the Community and that all such products which are shown to contain melamine in excess of 2,5 mg/kg are immediately destroyed. Melamine from different sources, such as migration from food contact materials, pesticide use, etc. can be present in feed and food. Taking into account the available occurrence data, the level of 2,5 mg/kg is the appropriate level to distinguish between the unavoidable background presence of melamine and unacceptable adulteration. This level responds also to the need to ensure a large margin of safety. Member States have reported significant difficulties in establishing the exact milk or milk product content of composite products. As a consequence, the value of 15 % above is largely devoid of relevance for deciding whether a consignment is subject to control requirements prior to import. In order to streamline and simplify import controls procedures, it is therefore appropriate to establish the requirement of controls irrespective of the exact amount of milk or milk products in the composite products.
(7) Member States should also ensure that composite products which are already present in the Community are appropriately tested and withdrawn from the market if necessary. The costs of tests at import and of official measures taken as regards products found to be non-compliant with the maximum level in question should be borne by the feed and food business operator responsible for the products.
(8) In order for the Commission to be able to reassess appropriateness of these measures in due time, Member States should inform the Commission of unfavourable results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed and should report favourable results on a two weeks basis.
(9) The measure provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '15.10.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 273/18', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 October 2008\nimposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating in or consigned from China, and repealing Commission Decision 2008/757/EC\n(notified under document number C(2008) 6086)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/798/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.\n\n((2)) The European Commission was recently made aware that high levels of melamine were found in infant milk and other milk products in China.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 127(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular Article 3.1, Article 22 and the first indent of Article 34.1 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 of the European Central Bank of 3 July 2014 on oversight requirements for systemically important payment systems (ECB/2014/28) (1), and in particular Article 1(2) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The fourth indent of Article 127(2) of the Treaty and the fourth indent of Article 3.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’) empower the Eurosystem to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.
(2) The Eurosystem promotes the smooth operation of payment systems, inter alia, by conducting oversight.
(3) The European Central Bank (ECB) has implemented the principles for financial market infrastructures issued by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) (hereinafter the ‘CPSS-IOSCO principles’), which harmonise and strengthen existing international oversight standards for, inter alia, systemically important payment systems (SIPS), by means of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28).
(4) In order to carry out the identification exercise pursuant to Article 1(2) of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28) for TARGET2, the Governing Council is verifying that the criterion mentioned in point (a) of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28) is fulfilled, and two out of four of the criteria mentioned in point (b) of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EU) No 795/2014 (ECB/2014/28) are fulfilled, as described in the Annex to this Decision.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (1), and in particular Article 22(3) and Article 24(2),
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (2), and in particular Article 9(2)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 (3) lays down veterinary certification requirements for imports into, and transit through, the Community of poultry and certain poultry products. It provides that the commodities covered by that Regulation (‘the commodities’) are only to be imported into, and transit through, the Community from third countries, territories, zones or compartments which are free from disease and are listed in the table in Part 1 of Annex I thereto. In addition, model veterinary certificates are set out in Part 2 of that Annex. Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also provides that where examination, sampling and testing for certain diseases are required for imports of the commodities, they are to be carried out in accordance with Annex III thereto.
(2) Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 provides that the commodities may only be imported into the Community where the third country informs the Commission of any initial outbreaks of Newcastle Disease or highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) and submits virus isolates to the Community reference laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease.
(3) Where an outbreak of avian influenza is detected on the territory of a third country, or a zone or compartment(s) thereof, the competent authority of that third country may no longer certify that its territory, zone or compartment(s) thereof, as listed in Part 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008, is free from that disease.
(4) In the interests of animal health and the prevention and monitoring of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) at Community level, it is appropriate that initial outbreaks of that disease be reported to the Commission. Article 7 of Regulation (EC) 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Canada has demonstrated its capability to respond to outbreaks of LPAI in poultry holdings on its territory and to successfully prevent the spread of infection.
(6) Canada has also provided the Commission with detailed information on the epidemiological situation and the disease control measures taken by it, including a description of the areas placed under official restrictions in relation to outbreaks of LPAI.
(7) Council Decision 1999/201/EC of 14 December 1998 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products (4) approved that Agreement, which provides that each Party to it is to recognise a sanitary measure of the other Party as equivalent if the latter objectively demonstrates that its measure achieves the appropriate level of protection.
(8) In view of that Agreement and the disease control system put in place in Canada, it is appropriate to apply alternative certification provisions for day-old chicks and hatching eggs originating from areas outside those placed under official restrictions for LPAI. Accordingly, the model veterinary certificates for day-old chicks other than ratites and hatching eggs of poultry other than ratites should be amended to allow for alternative certification provisions for Canada in the case of future outbreaks of LPAI.
(9) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has recently issued recommendations on certain treatment procedures for the commodities for the inactivation of disease agents. The model veterinary certificate for egg products should therefore be amended in order to take account of those recommendations.
(10) Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) In addition, the testing method for a Salmonella subspecies of animal health relevance should be amended to allow third countries to use laboratory methods as recommended by the OIE. Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(12) In addition, a footnote should be corrected in the model veterinary certificate for transit/storage of specified pathogen-free eggs, meat, minced meat and mechanically separated meat of poultry, ratites and wild game-birds, eggs and egg products. Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period to permit Member States and industry to take the necessary measures to comply with the applicable veterinary certification.
(14) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '20.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 124/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 411/2009\nof 18 May 2009\namending Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008(3)lays down veterinary certification requirements for imports into, and transit through, the Community of poultry and certain poultry products.

amending Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 on implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(c), Articles 11 and 12 and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 (2) lays down rules for the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of animals, in relation to bluetongue, in and from the restricted zones. It also establishes the conditions for exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of susceptible animals, their semen, ova and embryos provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC.
(2) Where exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of animals of susceptible species, their semen, ova an embryos from the restricted zones are applied to such animals or products intended for intra-Community trade or for export to a third country, health certificates provided for in Council Directive 64/432/EEC (3), Council Directive 91/68/EEC (4), Council Directive 92/65/EEC (5) and referred to in Commission Decision 93/444/EEC (6) are to include a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007. On the basis of the experience gained, it is appropriate to provide for an additional wording to be added to all those health certificates in order to make more explicit the health conditions under which the animals, semen, ova and embryos are exempted from the exit ban.
(3) Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (7), Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species (8), Commission Decision 95/388/EC of 19 September 1995 determining the specimen certificate for intra-Community trade in semen, ova and embryos of the ovine and caprine species (9) and Decision 93/444/EEC provide that health certificates are to accompany the movements of semen, ova and embryos of bovine, ovine and caprine species.
(4) On the basis of the experience gained, where exemptions from the exit ban applicable to movements of semen, ova and embryos of animals of the susceptible species from the restricted zones are applied, those health certificates should also include a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007. An additional wording should therefore be added to those health certificates in order to make more explicit the health conditions under which the semen, ova and embryos are exempted from the exit ban.
(5) In vivo derived embryos and ova of bovine animals do not pose any significant risk as regards bluetongue. Therefore exemptions from the exit ban should be applicable to them provided that the donor animals do not show any clinical signs of bluetongue on the day of collection of the embryos and ova.
(6) For clarity reasons, certain changes as regards the naturally immunised animals referred in points 6 and 7 of Annex III and the provisions reated to ova and embryos should be introduced in the text.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.4.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 89/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 289/2008\nof 31 March 2008\namending Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 on implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007(2)lays down rules for the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of animals, in relation to bluetongue, in and from the restricted zones.

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, pursuant to Article 39 (2) (a) of the Treaty, the social structure of agriculture and the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions must be taken into account in working out the common agricultural policy;
Whereas, in order to achieve the objectives of the common agricultural policy referred to in Article 39 (1) (a) and (b) of the Treaty, special measures adapted to the situation in the less-favoured agricultural areas should be adopted at Community level;
Whereas in northern Italy the less-favoured agricultural areas, within the meaning of Council Directive 75/268/EEC of 28 April 1975 on mountain and hill farming and farming in certain less-favoured areas (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 797/85, are in a particularly difficult situation;
Whereas these areas are not covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2088/85 of 23 July 1985 concerning the integrated Mediterranean programmes (5);
Whereas the rural infrastructure of these areas is very inadequate as regards public services such as electricity, drinking water, farm roads and local roads, and the creation or improvement of such services is an important precondition for the improvement of agricultural structures;
Whereas given the existence of agricultural land subject to soil erosion it is especially vital to protect soil and watercourses;
Whereas a specific system of aids for forestry schemes is especially important in less-favoured areas; whereas forestry contributes to a better use of employment in agriculture and provides additional agricultural income;
Whereas measures for the consolidation of agricultural land reduces its fragmentation and enables farm machinery to be used more efficiently;
Whereas the prevention of soil erosion helps:
- to preserve the soil, the countryside and surface and ground water flow;
- to maintain the recreational potential of an area;
Whereas soil improvement can help to reduce production costs;
Whereas farmers' incomes can also be increased by supplementary activities in the field of rural tourism which require the provision of collective infrastructures by local authorities;
Whereas Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 797/85 provides for the adoption of specific measures to encourage agriculture as a whole in the region concerned, in harmony with any development schemes simultaneously undertaken in non-agricultural sectors and with the needs of environmental protection; whereas the Council, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, is to decide on these measures;
Whereas the achievement of these objectives should be encouraged by a measure which combines these various elements within programmes;
Whereas it is apparent from the foregoing that the abovementioned measures constitute a common measure within the meaning of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 870/85 (7);

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in accordance with the Agreement with Austria, as extended by the exchange of letters (1) for the period from 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993 regarding reciprocal creation of tariff quotas for certain quality wines, the Community is committed to  suspending in full the customs duties applicable to quality wines and sparkling wines, originating in Austria, which conform to the wine and viticulture law of 1985 of the Republic of Austria, presented in containers not exceeding two litres, within the  limits of annual tariff quotas of 85 000 and 2 000 hectolitres respectively; whereas this Agreement also provides that the quota period is from 1 July of each year to 30 June of the next year and whereas the duties applicable in Spain and Portugal are  equal to those applied by Member States with respect to the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985; whereas it is necessary therefore to open for the period 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993 the Community tariff quotas in question at the amounts  provided for in the Agreement;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to allow all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quotas and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for the quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all  Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas it is appropriate to take the necessary measures to ensure efficient Community administration of these tariff quotas while offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota  volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the  quotas are being used up and inform the Member States accordingly;

","Commission Regulation (EC) No 108/2004
of 22 January 2004
fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) Import duties and export refunds still apply to certain sugar products traded between the Community, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, hereinafter referred to as ""new Member States"", of the other part, and the level of export refunds is appreciably greater than the level of import duties. In view of the accession of these countries to the Community on 1 May 2004, the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted for the products in question may result in speculative trade flows.
(10) To prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund or levy should be set for all the new Member States for the products covered by this Regulation.
(11) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 368/98(3), the Council imposed an anti-dumping duty of 24 % on imports of glyphosate originating in the People's Republic of China (""the PRC""). By Regulation (EC) No 1086/2000(4), the rate of duty applicable was increased to 48 % as a result of the investigation into the absence of movement, or insufficient movement of, the resale prices or subsequent selling prices in the Community pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (""the basic Regulation"").
(2) On 26 March 2001, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation from the European Glyphosate Association (EGA) to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of glyphosate originating in the PRC by imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia or Taiwan. The request was made on behalf of a major proportion of Community producers of glyphosate and contained sufficient evidence regarding the factors set out in Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation.
(3) The Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention by Regulation (EC) No 909/2001(5) (""the initiating Regulation"").
(4) Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, Article 2 of the initiating Regulation instructed the customs authorities to register imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia or Taiwan, whether declared as originating in Malaysia or Taiwan or not, as of 10 May 2001.
(5) Article 2(3) of the initiating Regulation provided that imports should be exempted from registration if they were accompanied by a customs certificate certifying that the importation does not constitute, circumvention.
B. REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION
(6) In the course of the investigation, the Commission received requests for exemption from the registration or measures from four unrelated importers and two cooperating exporting producers, Crop Protection (M) Sdn Bhd. (""Crop Protection"") and Sinon Corporation.
(7) Given that the alleged circumvention was taking place outside the Community, exemption of imports from registration or measures was dependent on the findings in respect of the exporters. No decision could therefore be taken by the Commission purely on the basis of the exemption requests presented by individual importers. The importers will however benefit from an exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from exporters which have been granted such an exemption.
(8) Any decision concerning exporters should be limited to exemption from registration at this stage. If the Council subsequently adopts a Regulation extending the anti-dumping measures pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, it may decide to exempt certain exporters from such extended measures.
C. FINDINGS IN RESPECT OF CROP PROTECTION AND SINON CORPORATION
(9) Among others, Crop Protection and Sinon Corporation replied to the questionnaire sent by the Commission to the producers and exporters in Malaysia and Taiwan named in the request, to the importers in the Community and to the exporters in the PRC known to the Commission as well as to other interested parties who came forward within the prescribed time limit. The Commission carried out verification visits at the premises of Crop Protection (Klang, Selangor D.E., Malaysia) and Sinon Corporation (Taichung, Taiwan).
(10) Crop Protection transformed purchased glyphosate acid, part of which was originating in the PRC, into salt or formulated products. However, their purchases of PRC origin acid increased less significantly than their purchases of non-PRC origin acid and did not show a constant movement (plunge in 1998, increase up to 2000, decrease within the IP). Moreover, most of the supply of PRC origin acid was caused by Monsanto (M) Sdn. Bhd. (Malaysia)(6) due to its inability to supply Crop Protection with the US origin acid it had ordered. Direct purchases from another supplier in the PRC were minor. Additionally, to satisfy customers' requests, Crop Protection limited the use of acid originating in the PRC for production of glyphosate exported to the Community. It was therefore considered that Crop Protection demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the change in the pattern of trade in their respect had a due cause other than the imposition of the duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the PRC and did not constitute circumvention.
(11) Sinon Corporation produces glyphosate starting from the initial stage of producing glyphosate acid and also formulates purchased glyphosate acid which does not originate in the PRC, both operations being carried out in Taiwan. The investigation has shown that Sinon has exported to the Community its own produced product, with the exception of limited quantities of formulated glyphosate purchased from a Malaysian company and shipped directly from Malaysia to the Community. It was therefore considered that Sinon Corporation demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Commission that the change in the pattern of trade in their respect had a due cause other than the imposition of the duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the PRC and did not constitute circumvention.
(12) In the light of the above findings, registration of imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia and produced by Crop Protection and of glyphosate consigned from Taiwan and produced by Sinon Corporation should cease.
(13) Given that exemption from registration is made in respect of the exporting producers in this case, it was considered unnecessary and disproportionate to request each importer importing from Crop Protection or Sinon Corporation to apply for a customs certificate exempting their imports from registration. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to amend its initiating Regulation in so far as it provides for the registration of imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia or Taiwan (whether declared as originating in Malaysia or Taiwan or not).
(14) This Regulation is based on findings specific to Crop Protection and Sinon Corporation and does not prejudge any decision which the Council may take to extend the existing anti-dumping measures on glyphosate originating in the PRC to the same product consigned from Malaysia or Taiwan (whether declared as originating in Malaysia or Taiwan or not).
(15) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to cease registration of imports of glyphosate produced by Crop Protection and of glyphosate produced by Sinon Corporation and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments which were of a nature to change the above conclusions were received,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2593/2001 of 28 December 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 909/2001 as regards registration of imports of glyphosate produced by one Malaysian and one Taiwanese exporting producer', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following paragraph shall be added to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 909/2001: ""4.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as amended by Commission Directive 94/15/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas Articles 10 to 18 of Directive 90/220/EEC lay down a Community procedure enabling the competent authority of a Member State to give consent to the placing on the market of products consisting of genetically modified organisms;
Whereas a notification concerning the placing on the market of such a product has been submitted to the competent authority of a Member State (France);
Whereas the competent authority of France subsequently forwarded the dossier to the Commission with a favourable opinion; whereas the competent authorities of other Member States have raised objections to the said dossier;
Whereas, therefore, in accordance with Article 13 (3) of Directive 90/220/EEC, the Commission is required to take a decision in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 21 of that Directive;
Whereas, having examined each objection in the light of the provisions of Directive 90/220/EEC and analysed the information supplied in the dossier, the Commission reached the following conclusions:
- the applicant provided information on all the newly introduced genes, and not only those expressed,
- the risk assessment took account of all the introduced genes whether expressed or not. Assessment was also made in this case of the risks from the presence of the non-expressed â-lactamase gene with a bacterial promoter,
- in the case of products intended for use as human food or animal feed, risk assessment under Directive 90/220/EEC determines whether the genetic modification is liable to result in any toxic or other harmful effects for human health and the environment,
- there is no reason to believe that the introduction of these genes into maize will have any adverse effects on human health or the environment,
- possible development of resistance to the truncated CryIA(b) protein in insects cannot be considered an adverse environmental effect, as existing agricultural means of controlling such resistant species of insects will still be available,
- there are no safety grounds for mentioning on the label that the product has been obtained by genetic modification techniques,
- the label should indicate that the plants have increased tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium;
Whereas authorization of chemical herbicides, and assessment of how their use impacts on human health and the environment, are governed by Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), as last amended by Commission Directive 96/68/EC (4), and not by Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas the product under consideration has been notified for unrestricted use, including human food and animal feed;
Whereas this Decision does not exclude the application, in compliance with Community law, of Member State provisions on human food or animal feed safety to the extent that they are not specifically related to the genetic modification of the product or its components;
Whereas Article 11 (6) and Article 16 (1) of Directive 90/220/EEC provide additional safeguards if new information on risks presented by the product becomes available;
Whereas the committee set up by Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC and consulted by written procedure on 8 March 1996 has not delivered an opinion on the measures laid down in a draft Commission decision;
Whereas the Council did not take a decision on a proposal from the Commission within the time provided for in the fifth paragraph of Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC; whereas, consequently, it falls to the Commission to adopt the proposed measures;
Whereas the respective opinions of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition established by Commission Decision 76/791/EEC (5), that of the Scientific Committee for Food established by Commission Decision 95/273/EC (6) and finally that of the Scientific Committee for Pesticides established by Commission Decision 78/436/EEC (7), asked by the Commission to confirm that there is no reason to believe that the introduction of the genes concerned into the maize would have any adverse effects on human health or on the environment, did not identify any new elements which would justify any different decision,","{'title': '97/98/EC: Commission Decision of 23 January 1997 concerning the placing on the market of genetically modified maize (Zea mays L.) with the combined modification for insecticidal properties conferred by the Bt-endotoxin gene and increased tolerance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium pursuant to Council Directive 90/220/EEC (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 24 September 2003
conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Latvia in the preaccession period
(2003/672/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the preaccession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(1), and in particular Article 12(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The special programme for agriculture and rural development for the Republic of Latvia (hereinafter ""Sapard"") was approved by Commission decision of 25 October 2000(2), and last amended by Commission decision of 18 February 2003 in accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the preaccession period(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 696/2003(4).
(2) The Government of the Republic of Latvia and the Commission, acting on behalf of the Community, signed on 25 January 2001 the Multiannual Financing Agreement laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Sapard programme, amended by the Annual Financing Agreements for 2001, signed on 11 February 2002, for 2002 signed on 4 February 2003, and for 2003 signed on 27 June 2003.
(3) A Sapard agency has been appointed by the competent authority of the Republic of Latvia for the implementation of some of the measures defined in Sapard. The Ministry of Finance National Fund has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of Sapard.
(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted Decision 2001/885/EC of 6 December 2001 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Latvia in the preaccession period(5) with regard to certain measures provided for in Sapard.
(5) The Commission has since undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of the measure ""Technical assistance"" as provided for in Sapard. The Commission considers that, also with regard to those measures, the Republic of Latvia complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the preaccession period(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 188/2003(7) and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer, with regard to supporting measure 2 ""Technical assistance"", on the Sapard agency and on the Ministry of Finance National Fund in the Republic of Latvia, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(7) Since the verifications carried out by the Commission for supporting measure 2 ""Technical assistance"" are based on a system that is not yet fully operating with regard to all relevant elements, however, it is appropriate to confer the management of Sapard on the Sapard agency and on the Ministry of Finance National Fund according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.
(8) Conferral of management of Sapard is only envisaged after further verification to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily has been carried out and after any recommendations which the Commission may issue with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the Sapard agency and on the Ministry of Finance National Fund have been implemented.
(9) According to the second indent of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 expenditure with regard to feasibility and related studies and for technical assistance incurred by the beneficiary before the date of the Commission decision conferring management may be reimbursable. It is therefore appropriate to fix the date as of which such expenditure may be reimbursed,","{'title': '2003/672/EC: Commission Decision of 24 September 2003 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Latvia in the preaccession period', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe requirement of ex ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting for supporting measure 2 ""Technical assistance"" by the Republic of Latvia provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 is hereby waived.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nManagement of the Sapard programme is conferred on a provisional basis to:\n\n1. the Agency for Rural Support Service of the Republic of Latvia, Republikas Laukums 2, Riga LV 1981 for the implementation of supporting measure 2 ""Technical assistance"" as defined in the programme for agricultural and rural development that was approved in accordance with Commission Decision C(2000) 3097 of 25 October 2000;\n\nand\n\n2. the Ministry of Finance National Fund located at Smilsu Iela 1, Riga LV 1919, for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of Sapard for supporting measure 2 ""Technical assistance"" for the Republic of Latvia.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nExpenditure within the measure ""Technical assistance"" shall be eligible for Community cofinance from 25 October 2000, provided in all cases it has not been paid by the Sapard agency prior to the date of adoption of this decision.\n\nDone at Brussels, 24 September 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 68.\n\n(2) C(2000) 3097.\n\n(3) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 87.\n\n(4) OJ L 99, 17.4.2003, p. 24.\n\n(5) OJ L 327, 12.12.2001, p. 45.\n\n(6) OJ L 253, 7.10.2000, p. 5.\n\n(7) OJ L 27, 1.2.2003, p. 14.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions, the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty and the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The French Government submitted to the Commission on 28 April 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the region of Midi-Pyrénées fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. As permitted by Article 40(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(2), the draft includes rural development measures other than those referred to in Article 35(1) of the Regulation. It also includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000 the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible is 1 January 2000 in the case of the Structural Funds. In the case of the EAGGF Guarantee Section, Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999(3) provides that the expenditure is eligible only if it has actually been paid to the beneficiary after the date of submission of the programme. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The rural development measures to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section are governed, in particular as regards their compatibility and consistency with common agricultural policy measures, by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(7) The Single Programming Document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(8) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(9) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(10) The EIB has been involved in drawing up the Single Programming Document in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and has declared itself prepared to contribute to its implementation in conformity with its statutory provisions.
(11) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(12) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this Single Programming Document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/510/EC: Commission Decision of 22 March 2001 approving the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Midi-Pyrénées in France (notified under document number C(2001) 632)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Midi-Pyrénées in France eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1839/95 of 26 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of tariff quotas for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain and imports of maize into Portugal(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2235/2000(5), lays down the special detailed rules necessary for implementing invitations to tender.
(3) In the light of current market needs in Spain, an invitation to tender for the reduction in the duty on imports of sorghum should be opened.
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2286/2002 of 10 December 2002 on the arrangements applicable to agricultural products and goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1706/98(6) provides in particular for a reduction of 60 % in the import duty applicable to grain sorghum up to a quota of 100000 tonnes per calendar year and of 50 % in excess of that quota. If that benefit is combined with the benefit resulting from the invitations to tender for the reduction in the import duty, this is likely to disturb the Spanish market for cereals. Such combined benefits should therefore be ruled out.

Demarcation of the area covered by the programme\n\nMainland Portugal and the Islands of the Azores and Madeira.\n\n3. Duration of the programme\n\nThe programme refers only to 1986.\n\n4. Aims of the programme\n\nThe aims are as follows:\n\n- to stabilize in the short term the existing overall capacity of the fleet in the case of mainland Portugal, and to develop the capacity of the fleet in the Azores and Madeira,\n\n- to renew the fleet, given that it is on average too old,\n\n- to redeploy fishing effort carried out in inshore areas and estuaries towards deep, less exploited waters,\n\n- to modernize and diversify the fleet by introducing new fishing techniques and methods.\n\n5. Means of attaining these aims\n\n5.1. Construction of fishing vessels\n\n- stabilizing by 31 December 1986 the capacity of the fishing fleet in mainland Portugal at the level recorded on 31 December 1984, namely 181 000 gross registered tonnes (grt), a very slight increase in the overall tonnage of vessels above 25 grt which will go from 173 000 to 176 000 grt and from 948 to 985 vessels (1), which will rise from 3 000 to 4 645 grt,\n\n- adapting the existing capacity of the distant-water fleet fishing in third-country waters and the capacity of the inshore fleet; directing the fleet towards new fishing zones and new stocks,\n\n- controlling additions to the fleet, which must be offset by the withdrawal of vessels with overall gross registered tonnage equivalent to the newly-built tonnage,\n\n- introducing a system of temporary or permanent laying-up of vessels pursuant to Directive 83/515/EEC (2),\n\n- fixing priority criteria for the selection of projects which may be eligible for state aids.\n\n5.2. Modernization of fishing vessels\n\nModernizing, as a priority, vessels aged between 10 and 20 years, with a view to improving their technical and economic performance and to improving working conditions and safety on board. When only the replacement of engines is concerned, no increase will be permitted.\n\n6. Measures planned for reaching the objective set out in point 4\n\n6.1.

List of priorities\n\nA. Construction/Purchase of new vessels\n\n(between 9 and 33 m bp)\n\n(a) For tuna fishing and for fishing for other migratory species.\n\n(b) For inshore trawlers and gill nets, to replace vessels engaging in the same type of fishing (a new trawler may not exceed 22 m bp, 500 hp and 150 grt).\n\n(c) For other types of fishing, to replace other vessels. (Optional condition in the case of building work which has already begun or has been authorized.)\n\n- in the event of the withdrawal of at least 50 % of the grt and of the vessel to be built,\n\n- in the event of the withdrawal of at least 100 % of the grt and hp of the vessel to be built.\n\nSupplementary aid for the building of seiners with important innovations as regards the preservation and storage of fish, the modernization of on-board working facilities, the reduction of crews and the unloading of fish.\n\nWhere mechanized long-line fishing is being introduced, the subsidy is 50 % of the cost of the equipment.\n\nB. Modernization or conversion of working vessels\n\nbetween 9 and 33 m bp, with a view to rationalizing fishing operations, improving the preservation of catches or saving energy, each project being for an amount of at least 20 000 ECU (or 10 000 ECU for vessels between 9 and 12 m bp).\n\nPriority for vessels between 10 and 20 years old\n\n- for vessels fishing for tuna and other migratory species,\n\n- for the conversion of seiners with important innovations as regards the preservation and storage of fish, the modernization of working facilities, the reduction of crews and the unloading of fish,\n\n- for improving the preservation of fish on board and/or for saving energy,\n\n- for the purchase of long-lines,\n\n- for other types of modernization.\n\nC.

The Commission finds that the programme submitted by the Portuguese Government as the future framework for Community or national financial measures in 1986 constitutes an initial attempt to bring about the short-term restructuring of the fleet and to adapt it to the common fisheries policy, thus establishing satisfactory economic conditions for the fishing sector in tune with catch possibilities.\n\nThe implementation of the programme will, however, have to be accompanied by constant monitoring of progress as regards both the building of new vessels and the modernization of the existing fleet, so as to control capacity in line with the situation of stocks.\n\nThe Commission would therefore like the Portuguese authorities to introduce a permanent system for the management of fishing capacities linked to the management of fish stocks.\n\n2. The Commission approves of the Portuguese authorities' intention to adapt the capacity of the inshore fishing fleet to more selective types of fishing and to reduce the capacity of distant-water vessels operating in the waters of third countries, in view of the difficulties encountered in maintaining fishing possibilities in the waters of some of the latter.\n\nAs regards fishing in Community waters, the Commission shares the idea of redeploying a part of the fleet in fishing for new species in deeper, less exploited waters provided that this does not result in increased capacity. It also approves of the development of the fishing fleet, particularly the tuna fleet, in the Azores and Madeira in view of the stocks available in the waters close to these autonomous regions.\n\nThe Commission wants those measures to renew the fleet which entail the introduction of modern and more selective fishing techniques, the improvement of on-board preservation systems and the withdrawal from service of old and obsolete vessels to be carried out under the strict control of the Portuguese authorities so as to prevent an inappropriate increase in fishing capacity.\n\n3. The Commission also wants the system of withdrawing vessels under Directive 83/515/EEC to come into force rapidly. It is only by means of such withdrawals that the overall target of the programme can be reached.\n\n4. The Commission takes note of the criteria which the Portuguese authorities have decided to apply in the selection of projects eligible for public aid. It considers that these criteria will have to be modified gradually as the adaptation of the fleet progresses and in the light of withdrawals from service in particular.\n\nFurthermore, in the view of the present position as regards fishing agreements between the Community and the third countries concerned, the Commission considers that the situation will have to be reviewed at a later date in the light of experience acquired.\n\n5. In relation to the tuna fishery in general, the Commission draws the Portuguese authorities' attention to the recent evolution of this product's market situation. It is at present examining tuna's market situation. Whilst awaiting the results of this examination, it recommends that the Portuguese use great prudence when authorizing investments in the tuna fleet sector and to reduce the level of financial aid now envisaged for this fleet.\n\n6. The Commission points out that the investment forecasts contained in this programme are without prejudice to any decisions to grant Community financial assistance and that the present decision does not prejudge the evolution of the structural aspects of the common fisheries policy after 1986.\n\n7. Lastly, the Commission considers that the measures provided for under the programme and their actual execution will have to be subjected to more thorough examination, particularly in the light of the survey of stocks currently under way and the development of the structural and economic situation of the fishing industry in Portugal.""}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market (1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Service providers whose services fall within the scope of Directive 2006/123/EC must be able to complete, through the Points of Single Contact and by electronic means, the procedures and formalities necessary for the access to and the exercise of their activities. Within the limits established in Article 5(3) of Directive 2006/123/EC, there may still be cases where service providers have to submit original documents, certified copies or certified translations when completing such procedures and formalities. In those cases, service providers may need to submit documents signed electronically by competent authorities.
(2) The cross-border use of advanced electronic signatures supported by a qualified certificate is facilitated through Commission Decision 2009/767/EC of 16 October 2009 setting out measures facilitating the use of procedures by electronic means through the ‘points of single contact’ under Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on services in the internal market (2) which, inter alia, imposes an obligation on Member States to carry out risk assessments before requiring these electronic signatures from service providers and establishes rules for the acceptance by Member States of advanced electronic signatures based on qualified certificates, created with or without a secure signature creation device. However, Decision 2009/767/EC does not deal with formats of electronic signatures in documents issued by competent authorities, that need to be submitted by service providers when completing the relevant procedures and formalities.
(3) As competent authorities in Member States currently use different formats of advanced electronic signatures to sign their documents electronically, the receiving Member States that have to process these documents may face technical difficulties due to the variety of signature formats used. In order to allow service providers to complete their procedures and formalities across borders by electronic means, it is necessary to ensure that at least a number of advanced electronic signature formats can be technically supported by Member States when they receive documents signed electronically by competent authorities from other Member States. Defining a number of advanced electronic signature formats that need to be supported technically by the receiving Member State would allow greater automation and improve the cross-border interoperability of electronic procedures.
(4) Initially only the basic level of ETSI standardised formats of advanced e-signatures were covered by the Decision. It is appropriate to add also longer term levels of ETSI standardised formats which facilitate the preservation of validity related information of e-signatures over time.
(5) New technical specifications have been published by ETSI for baseline profiles for advanced e-signatures that aim at limiting the choices in the relevant standards and thereby increase cross-border interoperability. These profiles cover all conformance levels, from the basic to long term level.
(6) Member States whose competent authorities use other electronic signature formats than those commonly supported, may have implemented validation means that allow their signatures to be verified also across borders. When this is the case and in order for the receiving Member States to be able to rely on these validation tools, it is necessary to make information on these tools available in an easily accessible way unless the necessary information is included directly in the electronic documents, in the electronic signatures or in the electronic document carriers.
(7) This Decision does not affect the determination by the Member States of what constitutes an original, a certified copy or a certified translation. Its objective is limited to facilitating the verification of electronic signatures if they are used in the originals, certified copies or certified translations that service providers may need to submit via the Points of Single Contact.

Whereas Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste (8) provides that waste must be disposed of without endangering human health and without harming the environment; whereas, to this end, the same Directive stipulates that any installation or undertaking treating waste must obtain a permit from the competent authority relating, inter alia, to the precautions to be taken;
Whereas Council Directive 84/360/EEC of 28 June 1984 on the combating of air pollution from industrial plants (9) provides that Member States shall apply policies and strategies, including appropriate measures, for the gradual adaptation of existing plants to the best available technology not entailing excessive costs; whereas these provisions apply, inter alia, with regard to existing municipal waste-incineration plants;
Whereas Directive 84/360/EEC stipulates that the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, shall, if necessary, fix emission limit values based on the best available technology not entailing excessive costs and suitable measurement techniques and mehtods;
Whereas incineration of municipal waste gives rise to emissions of substances which can cause air pollution and thereby harm public health and the environment; whereas in some cases this pollution may have transboundary features;
Whereas the techniques for reducing emissions of certain pollutants from municipal waste-incineration plants are well established; whereas they can be implemented in existing incineration plants on a gradual basis bearing in mind the technical features of the plants and the advisability of not entailing excessive costs; whereas they provide a means of attaining concentrations of pollutants in the combustion gases not exceeding certain limit values;
Whereas all the Member States have laws, regulations and administrative provisions concerning the combating of air pollution from stationary plants and whereas several Member States have specific provisions on municipal wast-incineration plants;
Whereas the Community, by fixing emission limit values and other pollution prevention requirements, helps to increase the effectiveness of the action taken by the Member States to combat air pollution from municipal waste-incineration plants;
Whereas, in order rapidly to ensure an effective protection of the environment, appropriate time limits should be laid down for adapting existing incineration plants to the best available technology not entailing excessive costs; whereas it is appropriate that in the end all existing municipal waste-incineration plants should comply with the same conditions as those which apply, according to their respective category, to new plants;
Whereas the requirements to be imposed on existing plants must include the obligation to comply with both the limit values for the emission of the most significant pollutants and appropriate combustion conditions; whereas, in fixing these combustion conditions, account must be taken of any major technical difficulties which might arise; whereas provision must be made for appropriate measurements and verifications at the incineration plants and whereas the public must be informed of the results obtaines;
Whereas account should be taken of the problem posed by the emission of dioxins and furans;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 8(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 75/91(3) provides among other things that rice held by intervention agencies is to be sold by tendering procedure at prices avoiding market disturbance.
(2) France still has intervention stocks of paddy rice from the 1999 harvest, the quality of which is in danger of deteriorating if kept in prolonged storage.
(3) Disposing of this rice on traditional markets inside the Community would inevitably trigger off - in the present production situation where concessions for rice imports are being granted under international agreements and subsidised exports restricted - the placing of an equivalent quantity in intervention, which must be avoided.
(4) This rice can be disposed of by processing it into either broken rice or products derived therefrom, or into some other form suitable for use in animal feed, on certain conditions.
(5) In order to ensure that the rice really is processed, the procedure should be specially monitored and the successful tenderer should provide a security, to be released on conditions to be laid down.
(6) The undertakings given by tenderers must be regarded as primary requirements within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(5).
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 770/96(7), lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use of products from intervention. Procedures should also be laid down to ensure the traceability of the products used for animal feed.
(8) So that the quantities awarded can be managed accurately, an allocation coefficient should be fixed for tenders offering the minimum selling price, while allowing tenderers to specify a minimum quantity awarded below which they do not wish their tender to stand.
(9) When the French intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(10) While respecting the tenderers' anonymity, they should be identified by numbers so that it is evident which have submitted several tenders and what prices they have offered.
(11) For control purposes, tenders must be traceable by their reference numbers, while safeguarding anonymity.
(12) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular Article 17(2)(b), the first indent of Article 18(1), and the introductory phrase and point (b) of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2010/472/EU of 26 August 2010 on imports of semen, ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species into the Union (2) sets out a list of third countries or parts thereof from which Member States are to authorise the importation into the Union of consignments of semen, ova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species. It also lays down additional guarantees as regards specific animal diseases to be provided by certain third countries or parts thereof listed in Annexes I and III thereto and establishes the model health certificates for such imports in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.
(2) The animal health requirements relating to bluetongue in the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are based on the recommendations of Chapter 8.3 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for animal Health (OIE) which deals with that disease. That Chapter recommends a whole range of risk mitigating measures aiming at either protecting the mammalian host from exposure to the infectious vector or at inactivating the virus by antibodies.
(3) In addition, the OIE has laid down a Chapter on Surveillance for arthropod vectors of animal diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Those recommendations do not include the monitoring of ruminants for antibodies to Simbu viruses, such as the Akabane and Aino viruses of the Bunyaviridae family, which in the past was considered an economical method for determining the distribution of bluetongue competent vectors until more information on the spread of those diseases became available.
(4) Also, the OIE does not list Akabane and Aino diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Consequently, the requirement for annual testing for those diseases to prove the absence of the vector should be deleted from Annexes I and III to Decision 2010/472/EU and from the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.
(5) In addition, the animal health requirements for epizootic haemorrhagic disease in the model health certificates in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are not entirely consistent with the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU of 20 September 2011 on imports into the Union of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (3) and the recommendations of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the OIE. Those model health certificates should therefore be amended to take account of the requirements laid down in Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU and the recommendations of that Manual.
(6) The Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) To avoid any disruption of trade, the use of health certificates issued in accordance with Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.

It also lays down additional guarantees as regards specific animal diseases to be provided by certain third countries or parts thereof listed in Annexes I and III thereto and establishes the model health certificates for such imports in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.\n\n((2)) The animal health requirements relating to bluetongue in the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are based on the recommendations of Chapter 8.3 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for animal Health (OIE) which deals with that disease. That Chapter recommends a whole range of risk mitigating measures aiming at either protecting the mammalian host from exposure to the infectious vector or at inactivating the virus by antibodies.\n\n((3)) In addition, the OIE has laid down a Chapter on Surveillance for arthropod vectors of animal diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Those recommendations do not include the monitoring of ruminants for antibodies to Simbu viruses, such as the Akabane and Aino viruses of theBunyaviridaefamily, which in the past was considered an economical method for determining the distribution of bluetongue competent vectors until more information on the spread of those diseases became available.\n\n((4)) Also, the OIE does not list Akabane and Aino diseases in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Consequently, the requirement for annual testing for those diseases to prove the absence of the vector should be deleted from Annexes I and III to Decision 2010/472/EU and from the model health certificates set out in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV thereto.\n\n((5)) In addition, the animal health requirements for epizootic haemorrhagic disease in the model health certificates in Part 2 of Annexes II and IV to Decision 2010/472/EU are not entirely consistent with the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU of 20 September 2011 on imports into the Union of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(3)and the recommendations of the Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the OIE. Those model health certificates should therefore be amended to take account of the requirements laid down in Implementing Decision 2011/630/EU and the recommendations of that Manual.\n\n((6)) The Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((7)) To avoid any disruption of trade, the use of health certificates issued in accordance with Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision should be authorised during a transitional period subject to certain conditions.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nFor a transitional period until 30 June 2013, Member States shall authorise imports from third countries of consignments of:\n(a)\nsemen of animals of the ovine and caprine species which are accompanied by a health certificate issued not later than 31 May 2013 in accordance with the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision.\n(b)\nova and embryos of animals of the ovine and caprine species accompanied by a health certificate issued not later than 31 May 2013 in accordance with the model health certificate set out in Part 2 of Annex IV to Decision 2010/472/EU in its version prior to the amendments introduced by this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 January 2013.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nThe Annexes to Decision 2010/472/EU are amended as follows:\n(1)\nAnnex I is replaced by the following:\n‘ANNEX I\nList of third countries or parts thereof from which Member States are to authorise imports of consignments of semen of animals of the ovine and caprine species\nISO Code\nName of the third country\nRemarks\nDescription of the territory\n(\nif appropriate\n)\nAdditional guarantees\nAU\nAustralia\nThe additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\nCA\nCanada\nThe additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\nCH\nSwitzerland\n(\n*1\n)\nCL\nChile\nGL\nGreenland\nHR\nCroatia\nIS\nIceland\nNZ\nNew Zealand\nPM\nSaint Pierre and Miquelon\nUS\nUnited States\nThe additional guarantee as regards testing set out in point II.4.9.1 of the model health certificate set out in Section A of Part 2 of Annex II is compulsory.\n(2)\nin Part 2 of Annex II, Section A is replaced by the following:\n‘\nSection A\nModel 1 — Health certificate for semen dispatched from an approved semen collection centre of origin of the semen\nText of image\nPart I: Details of dispatched consignment\nCOUNTRY\nVeterinary certificate to EU\nI.1.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) N° 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for  the conservation and management of fishery resources (3), and in particular Article 2 (d) thereof,  lists as one of its objectives conservation measures consisting of restricting fishing effort;
Whereas the resolution of the European Parliament on the Commission's 1991 report on the common  fisheries policy (4) refers to the structural adjustment of the fleet through the adoption of a new  generation of MGPs ensuring a reduction in fishing capacity differentiated according to region and  fishery;
Whereas at its meeting of 3 April 1992 the Council concluded that in order to ensure the continuity  of fisheries, one of the objectives of the future common fisheries policy must be to re-establish  the balance between resources and fishing effort, including capacity, and to maintain a balanced  and rational management of resources;
Whereas the Economic and Social Committee, in its opinion on the 1991 report delivered on 27 May  1992,  takes the view that the MGPs are an essential means of matching fishing capacity to  exploitable resources and that further reduction of the Community's fleet must be differentiated;
Whereas on 30 April 1991 the Irish Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance  programme for the fishing fleet for the period 1992 to 1996, herinafter called 'the programme`, in  accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86; whereas it later forwarded additional  information concerning the programme;
Whereas on examination the Irish Programme was found to meet the conditions laid down in Article 2  of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 and in particular paragraph 2 (a) thereof concerning the  establishment of a viable fleet, in line with the economic and social needs of the regions  concerned and with the foreseeable catch potential in the medium term, whereas taking into account  that the quotas allocated to Ireland do not for all stocks correspond to the real catch potential,  that the programme can constitute a framework for Community and national finance in the sector  concerned;
Whereas the objectives for reducing fleet capacity fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programme constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the  effort still needed to ensure that the objectives are achieved;
Whereas the Commission adopted a transitional programme for 1992 (5); whereas the objectives fixed  in the Irish transitional programme should be included in the objectives of the present programme;
Whereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in  order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in  particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is most apparent; whereas coefficients for the  reduction of fishing effort, differentiated according to fishery or group of fisheries, should  therefore be applied to the segments of the fleet thus identified;
Whereas account must be taken of an annual increase of 2 % in fishing effort linked to technical  progress;
Whereas available biological and economic analyses suggest that overall reduction in fishing  effort, differentiated for the broad groups of target species, should be of 20 % for demersal  species, 15 % for benthic species and zero growth in effort for pelagic species;
Whereas, in order to attain these objectives and improve fishing methods, reductions in effort  should primarily be focused on segments of the fleet using non-selective gear, particularly those  likely to catch large numbers of juveniles, while ensuring that there is no increase in segments  using more selective gear;.
Whereas, in order to attain the objectives of the programme, it may be necessary to take steps to  influence all the parameters connected with fishing mortality, particularly the capacity and  activity of the fleet; whereas, however, structural measures must be focused chiefly on the  elimination of excess capacity;
Whereas it is necessary to verify that the objectives fixed in the programme are progressively and  coherently met; whereas intermediate and indicative annual objectives should therefore be  determined as a basis for Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86;
Whereas in addition to the six-monthly transmission by Ireland of statements concerning development  of the fishing fleet and, where applicable, its activity, it is necessary to ensure that these data  tally with the information in the Community register of fishing vessels;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the  objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken  under this programme may not warrant Community financial assistance;
Whereas to programme a concerted and balanced reduction in the overall fishing effort of the  Community's fleets requires the Community aid scheme to be focused on measures enabling the  objectives of the programme to be attained within the deadlines laid down; whereas priority  should  also be given to investments aimed at bringing the fleet into line with Community rules on hygiene  and safety and to investments in the development of selective fisheries which cause minimum damage  to the marine environment;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the  Standing Committee for the Fishing Industry,","{'title': '92/594/EEC: Commission Decision of 21 December 1992 on a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet of Ireland for the period 1993 to 1996 pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet for the  period 1992 to 1996, as forwarded by the Irish Government on 30 April 1991 and supplemented by the  Government at a later date, is hereby approved subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision  and provided that those conditions are met.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nIn order to ensure a durable balance between fishery resources and the fishing effort  of the Community fleet, Ireland has segmented its fishing fleet as shown in the Annex.

Annual intermediate objectives In order to ensure proper monitoring based on the gradual achievement of the objectives fixed in  the programme, annual intermediate objectives shall be set for the programme. These objectives  shall be expressed as a percentage of the objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programmes.\n\nIn addition to the single objective of 2 % fixed in the transitional programme for 1992, a  percentage equal to 25 % of the overall objective less 2 % should be achieved in each year of the  programme, starting from 31 December 1993.\n\n5. Implementation and monitoring Implementation of the measures to reduce the activity of vessels in certain segments of the fleet  will require that the Member State provide the Commission with the assurance that it will have the  following information for each of the segments concerned:\n\n- the data on the level of activity prior to the entry into force of the measures (reference basis:  1991),\n\n- assurance that it has effective time at sea management tools and is able to manage licensing  schemes, particularly with regard to multipurpose vessels,\n\n- data for monitoring the effect of the measures implemented under this programme in accordance  with Article 2 and the rules on the Community register of fishing vessels. Such measures must  produce effects which can be checked by the Commission pursuant to the Community rules on  controls.\n\n6. Planned measures Notwithstanding Articles 6 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86, priority shall be given to:\n\n- measures to adjust fishing capacity in line with exploitable resources,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels in order to bring them into line with Community rules on  hygiene and safety,\n\n- investments to improve fishing methods and allow fishing which is more selective and/or less  damaging to the marine environment,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels to improve the control of fishing operations.\n\nThe Commission hereby reminds local, regional and national authorities that any structural aid  granted to the sector in question must be included in the present programme.\n\n7. Revision of the programme The programme may be revised, on the initiative of the Commission, in the light of the experience  gained and the national and Community rules in force, in order to take account of new factors which  might help improve the implementation of the programme and ensure that its objectives are better  met.\n\nSuch revision must take place before the end of 1994.\n\nRevision may, if necessary, include the insertion into the programme of the tools for managing  measures to reduce the activity of fishing vessels for certain segments of the fleet. To this end  the objectives of the segments concerned will be expressed in a unit of measurement of capacity  (engine power and/or tonnage) per activity (time at sea), or using any other formula approved by  the Commission.\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1213/89 (2), and in particular Article 7 (5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1581/86 of 23 May 1986 laying down general rules for intervention on the market in cereals (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 195/89 (4), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 4 thereof,
Whereas the second paragraph of Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1581/86 provides that where cereals are purchased from intervention agencies for the purposes of fulfilling obligations arising from the award of Community food-aid supply contracts in connection with international conventions on food aid or other supplementary programmes, the conditions applicable with regard to prices and the detailed rules of application are to be determined in advance.
Whereas, in order to enable interested parties to take part under optimum conditions in the procedure for the award of food-aid supply contracts, they should be given the possibility of examining at their expense the quality and the characteristics of the product before the expiry of the closing date for the submission of tenders;
Whereas, in order to facilitate transactions, purchase applications must contain all information required to identify the product;
Whereas, in order to avoid disruption of the Community market and any distortion of competition between Community operators, the purchase price for the goods from public storage must be determined according to clear-cut criteria and be known to all tenderers in advance; whereas, in view of these requirements, provision should be made for goods purchased by the person awarded a Community food-aid supply contract to be paid at the buying-in price determined pursuant to Article 7 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75;
Whereas, in order that the conditions of competition existing when tenders are submitted for the award of the food-aid supply contract are not altered subsequent to the award of the contract, a derogation should be introduced from the application of certain procedures for adjusting the prices on the basis of the date of conclusion of the purchase contract or the date of removal of the goods;
Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87 of 8 July 1987 laying down general rules for the mobilization in the Community of products to be supplied as Community food aid (5) makes provision for the successful tenderer to deliver with a view to a food-aid supply contract goods which are not from public stocks or, where appropriate, manufactured therefrom, but goods mobilized on the market or manufactured therefrom provided that he purchases the goods mentioned in the notice of invitation to tender; whereas compliance with this latter obligation is essential on the one hand to meet the objective of contributing towards reducing public stocks and on the other hand to ensure the equality of operators in the award of the supply contract; whereas provision should therefore be made for the lodging by the successful tenderer of a specific security to ensure compliance with the obligation to pay the purchase price to the intervention agency concerned within a short time; whereas, consequently, with a view to that objective, provision should be made for failure to lodge a purchase application with the intervention agency under the conditions laid down to result in the loss of the security for the supply of the food aid, lodged pursuant to Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 2200/87; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1181/87 (7), should be applied for the lodging and the release of that specific security;
Whereas the execution of Community food-aid supply contracts is the subject of specific surveillance arrangements; whereas the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 569/88 of 16 February 1988 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1045/89 (9), should accordingly not apply;

A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 5 May 2000, an anti-dumping proceeding was initiated by the Commission(3) on imports of certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating, inter alia, in Turkey. This proceeding resulted in a definitive anti-dumping duty being imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001(4) in August 2001 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
(2) Provisional measures were imposed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 230/2001(5). In parallel, the Commission accepted, inter alia, a price undertaking from the Turkish exporting producer Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS by Article 2(1). Imports of products produced and directly exported by that company were, inter alia, exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Article 2(2).
B. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF THE UNDERTAKING
(3) Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS advised the Commission that they wished to withdraw this undertaking. Accordingly, the name of Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS should be deleted from the list of companies from whom an undertaking has been accepted.
(4) In parallel to this Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2288/2002(6) has also removed the exemption from the definitive anti-dumping duty granted to Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS, by amending Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1601/2001,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2303/2002 of 9 December 2002 amending Regulation No 230/2001 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on certain iron or steel ropes and cables originating in the Czech Republic, Russia, Thailand and Turkey and accepting undertakings offered by certain exporters in the Czech Republic and Turkey', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking accepted from Celik Halat ve Tel Sanayii AS is hereby withdrawn.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (1), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin. It provides, inter alia, that food business operators may place products of animal origin on the market only if they have been prepared and handled exclusively in establishments that meet the relevant requirements of Annex III thereto.
(2) Chapter VII of Section I of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 provides that meat of domestic ungulates may be transported before the temperature required under that Regulation is attained, if the competent authority so authorises to enable the production of specific products, subject to certain conditions.
(3) Accepted knowledge concerning appropriate microbiological and temperature criteria show that a similar provision would be beneficial for the production of foie gras to enable the use of traditional methods of production.
(4) Freezing carried out immediately after slaughter and chilling minimises the growth of bacteria and therefore the microbiological load upon thawing. Similarly to the provisions already established for meat of domestic ungulates, meat derived from poultry and lagomorphs intended for freezing should be frozen without undue delay after slaughter and chilling. Consequently, it is appropriate to amend Chapter V of Section II of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 accordingly.
(5) The rules laid down in Chapter II, of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 include specific requirements for live bivalve molluscs, live echinoderms, live tunicates and live marine gastropods, as regards the microbiological classification of production areas.
(6) Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) provides that the Member States are to ensure that the production and placing on the market of live bivalve molluscs, live echinoderms, live tunicates and live marine gastropods undergo official controls as provided for in Annex II thereto.
(7) Annex II to that Regulation provides that production areas are to be classified according to the level of faecal contamination. Filter feeder animals, such as bivalve molluscs, can accumulate micro-organisms representing a risk for public health.
(8) Marine gastropods are generally not filter feeder animals. Consequently, the risk of accumulation of micro-organisms related to faecal contamination may be considered to be remote. In addition, no epidemiological information has been reported to link the provisions for classification of production areas with risks for public health associated with marine gastropods which are not filter feeders. For this reason, such marine gastropods, should be excluded from provisions on the classification of production areas as laid down in Chapter II, of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.
(9) Chapter VI of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 only provides that individual consumer-sized packages of live bivalve molluscs must be closed and remain closed when transported after leaving the dispatch centre until presented for sale to the final consumer. Accordingly, other packages of live bivalve molluscs are not covered by that requirement. In the interest of public health, it is appropriate to amend that requirement so that all such packages must remain closed until presented to the final consumer.
(10) Chapter IX of Section VII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 establishes specific requirements for pectinidae harvested outside classified production areas. Such requirements should also apply to live marine gastropods which are not filter feeders. Point 4 of that Chapter establishes specific rules for the packaging of pectinidae. It is appropriate that the requirements for packages of live bivalve molluscs when transported from the dispatch centre to retail sale be applicable also to pectinidae and marine gastropods which are not filter feeders harvested outside classified production areas.
(11) Point A of Chapter III of Section VIII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down requirements for handling of fresh fishery products. The definition of fresh fishery products set out in point 3.5 of Annex I to that Regulation does not include thawed unprocessed fishery products and fresh fishery products to which food additives have been added in accordance with the appropriate legislation to ensure preservation. For consistency of Union legislation, the same requirements as for fresh fishery products should apply to those products.
(12) Point 2 of Chapter VII and Point 1(b) of Chapter VIII of Section VIII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 refers to a derogation for whole frozen fish in brine intended for canning from the general temperature requirement for frozen fishery products of not more than – 18 °C. For fish frozen in brine a temperature of not more than – 9 °C must be achieved for the product.
(13) When the whole fish frozen in brine intended for canning is removed from the brine solution used for the freezing process, it is unnecessary that the temperature must be further reduced by other means to not more than – 18 °C according with the common practice applied when using the brine method to freeze whole fish intended for canning.
(14) Point 1 of Chapter 1 of Section XIV and point 1 of Chapter I of Section XV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lay down requirements for raw material used for the production of gelatine and collagen intended for use in food.
(15) In January 2005, the European Food Safety Authority published a scientific opinion on the safety of collagen and a processing method for the production of collagen (3). According to this opinion, the use of bones for the production of collagen should not to be considered as a risk for public health It is therefore appropriate to lay down processing requirements in accordance with the opinion of EFSA and specify that the bones used as raw material have to be other than specified risk material as defined in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (4). Point 1 of Chapter I of Section XV of Annex III should be amended accordingly.
(16) For consistency of Union legislation, point 1 of Chapter I, point 1 of Chapter III of Section XIV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 regarding raw materials for the production of gelatine should be amended accordingly.

For fish frozen in brine a temperature of not more than –\xa09\xa0°C must be achieved for the product.\n\n((13)) When the whole fish frozen in brine intended for canning is removed from the brine solution used for the freezing process, it is unnecessary that the temperature must be further reduced by other means to not more than –\xa018\xa0°C according with the common practice applied when using the brine method to freeze whole fish intended for canning.\n\n((14)) Point 1 of Chapter 1 of Section XIV and point 1 of Chapter I of Section XV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lay down requirements for raw material used for the production of gelatine and collagen intended for use in food.\n\n((15)) In January 2005, the European Food Safety Authority published a scientific opinion on the safety of collagen and a processing method for the production of collagen(3). According to this opinion, the use of bones for the production of collagen should not to be considered as a risk for public health It is therefore appropriate to lay down processing requirements in accordance with the opinion of EFSA and specify that the bones used as raw material have to be other than specified risk material as defined in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(4). Point 1 of Chapter I of Section XV of Annex III should be amended accordingly.\n\n((16)) For consistency of Union legislation, point 1 of Chapter I, point 1 of Chapter III of Section XIV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 regarding raw materials for the production of gelatine should be amended accordingly.\n\n((17)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 is amended as follows:\n1.\nIn Section II, in Chapter V, points 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:\n‘3.\nAs soon as the meat is cut and, where appropriate, packaged, it must be chilled to a temperature of not more than 4\xa0°C.\n4.\nMeat must attain a temperature of not more than 4\xa0°C before transport, and be maintained at that temperature during transport.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1972/87 (2), and in particular Articles 46 (5) and 81 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1636/87 (4),
Having regard to the Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 409/87 (6),
Whereas, under the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 an aid system was introduced for the use of grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in wine-growing zones C III (a) and C III (b) for the preparation in the United Kingdom and Ireland of certain products, falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff and for the use of concentrated grape musts produced in the Community for the manufacture of certain products marketed in the United Kingdom and in Ireland with instructions for obtaining from them a beverage in imitation of wine;
Whereas the products falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of the abovementioned Regulation are at the moment produced exclusively from concentrated grape must; whereas, at present, aid should therefore be fixed for the use of concentrated grape must alone;
Whereas implementation of the aid system requires administrative arrangements for checking both the origin of the products for which aid is given and the use to which they are put;
Whereas, to ensure that the aid system and the controls operate properly, operators concerned must be required to submit written applications giving the information necessary to identify the product and enable the operations to be checked;
Whereas, so that the aid system can have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity for which applications may be submitted should be fixed;
Whereas it should also be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the minimum quality characteristics required for use for the purposes indicated in the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 46 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87;
Whereas Article 46 (3) of that Regulation sets criteria for fixing the aid; whereas application of those criteria gives the aid amounts fixed below;
Whereas, to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to make the necessary checks, obligations on operators in regard to the keeping of stock records should be laid down in addition to the provisions of Title II of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (7) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 418/86 (8);
Whereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas, to allow for technical losses, the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;
Whereas for technical reasons operators lay in their stocks a long time before manufacturing the marketed products; whereas arrangements should accordingly be made to enable advance payment of the aid to be made to operators, the competent authorities being guaranteed by an appropriate security against the risk of incorrect payment; whereas the period within which advance payment is to be made and the procedure for release of the security should be specified;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2620/87 of 27 August 1987 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of aid for the use of concentrated grape must for the manufacture in the United Kingdom and Ireland of certain products and fixing the aid for the 1987/88 wine year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nAid shall be granted for the 1987/88 wine year in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation:\n\n- to manufacturers, hereinafter referred to as 'manufacturers', who use concentrated grape must made entirely from grapes produced within wine-growing zones C III (a) and C III (b) for the manufacture in the United Kingdom and Ireland, of products falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff for which, by virtue of the first subparagraph of Article 72 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, the use of composite names including the word 'wine' may be permitted by those Member States,\n\n- to processors, hereinafter referred to as 'processors' who use concentrated grape must made entirely from grapes produced within the Community as the main component in a range of products marketed in the United Kingdom and Ireland by the said processors, with clear instructions enabling the consumer to obtain therefrom a beverage in imitation of wine.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 17 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (2) sets out the active substances deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(2) The approvals of the active substances captan, dimethoate, dimethomorph, ethoprophos, fipronil, folpet, formetanate, glufosinate, methiocarb, metribuzin, phosmet, pirimiphos-methyl and propamocarb will expire on 30 September 2017 and that of the active substance beflubutamid will expire on 30 November 2017. Applications have been submitted for the renewal of the approval of those active substances. As the requirements laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 (3) apply to those active substances, it is necessary to provide for sufficient time to complete the renewal procedure in accordance with that Regulation. Consequently, the approvals of those active substances are likely to expire before a decision has been taken on their renewal. It is therefore necessary to extend their approval periods.
(3) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(4) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where no supplementary dossier in accordance with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 844/2012 is submitted no later than 30 months before the respective expiry date laid down in the Annex to this Regulation, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the earliest date thereafter.
(5) In view of the aim of the first paragraph of Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, as regards cases where the Commission will adopt a Regulation providing that the approval of an active substance referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is not renewed because the approval criteria are not satisfied, the Commission will set the expiry date at the same date as before this Regulation or at the date of the entry into force of the Regulation providing that the approval of the active substance is not renewed, whichever date is later.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period(3), a Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development was approved by Commission Decision C(2000)3058 final on 20 October 2000 for the Republic of Bulgaria.
(2) The Government of the Republic of Bulgaria and the Commission, acting on behalf of the Euroepan Community, have signed on 18 December 2000 the Multiannual Financing Agreement laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Sapard Programme.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 provides that the ex-ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 may be waived on the basis of a case-by-case analysis of national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance. Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 provides for detailed rules for the carrying out of said analysis.
(4) The Competent authority of the Republic of Bulgaria has appointed, on the one hand, the State Agriculture Fund for the implementation of measures ""Investments in agricultural holdings"", ""Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products"" and ""Development and diversification of economic activities, provision for multiple activities and alternative income"" as defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development that was approved by Decision C(2000)3058 final for the Republic of Bulgaria and, on the other, the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund, for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme.
(5) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, the Commission has analysed the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance and has established that, for the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the Republic of Bulgaria complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999. In particular, the State Agriculture Fund has implemented the following key accreditation criteria satisfactorily: written procedures, segregation of duties, pre-project and pre-payment checks, commitment and payment procedures, accounting procedures, computer systems security and internal audit; the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund has implemented the following key accreditation criteria satisfactorily: audit trail, treasury management, receipt of funds, disbursement to the State Agriculture Fund, computer security and internal audit.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex-ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer on the State Agriculture Fund and on the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund in the Republic of Bulgaria the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(7) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission are based on an operational but not operating system and that it is therefore appropiate to confer the management of the Sapard Programme on the State Agriculture Fund and on the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund on a provisional basis so that full conferral of management of the Sapard Programme is only envisaged after further verifications in order to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily have been carried out and after any recommendations the Commission may issue, with regard the conferral of management of aid on the State Agriculture Fund and on the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund, have been implemented,","{'title': '2001/380/EC: Commission Decision of 14 May 2001 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Bulgaria in the pre-accession period (notified under document number C(2001) 1428)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe requirement of ex-ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting by the Republic of Bulgaria is hereby waived.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nManagement of the Sapard Programme is conferred on a provisional basis to the State Agriculture Fund, 55 Hristo Botev Boulevard, 1040 Sofia, Bulgaria for the implementation of the measures ""Investments in agricultural holding"", ""Improving the processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products"" and ""Development of and diversification of economic activities, provision for multiple activities and alternative income"", as defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development that was approved by Decision C(2000)3058 final and to the Ministry of Finance, Directorate National Fund, 102 Radkovski Street, 1040 Sofia, Bulgaria, for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for the Republic of Bulgaria.

Whereas pears are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas pears harvested during a given crop year are marketed from June of one year to May of the following year; whereas the quantities marketed in June and May of the following year are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices; whereas the reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period 1 July up to and including 30 April of the following year;

- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas to take variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying the specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas in accordance with Articles 140 (2) and 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Spanish and Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first phase in the case of Spain and during the first stage in the case of Portugal;

(1) Following the publication of a notice of impending expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of sacks and bags originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand(2), the Commission received on 8 July 2002 a request to review these measures pursuant to Article 11(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the Basic Regulation).
(2) The request was lodged by the European Association for Textile Polyolefins (EATP) on behalf of Community producers representing 32,03 % of the total Community production of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene.
(3) The request contained prima facie evidence showing that there would be a continuation or recurrence of injurious dumping should measures be allowed to lapse, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an expiry review.
(4) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, initiated by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports into the Community of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene, currently classifiable within CN codes 6305 32 81, 6305 33 91, ex 3923 21 00, ex 3923 29 10 and ex 3923 29 90 originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the representative users and the Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By a letter dated 22 October 2003 to the Commission, the EATP formally withdrew its request for an expiry review concerning imports of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand.
(7) According to Article 9(1) and Article 11(2) of the Basic Regulation, a proceeding may be terminated where the request for a review is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(8) It was considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. However, no comments were received from any party. Consequently, there is no indication that the termination of the measures would not be in the Community interest.
(9) It was therefore concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand should be terminated and that the existing measures should be repealed,","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EC) No 237/2004 of 10 February 2004 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe anti-dumping measures concerning imports of sacks and bags made of polyethylene or polypropylene, currently classifiable within CN codes 6305 32 81, 6305 33 91, ex 3923 21 00 (TARIC code: 3923 21 00*10 ), ex 3923 29 10 (TARIC code: 3923 29 10*10 ) and ex 3923 29 90 (TARIC code: 3923 29 90*10 ) and originating in the People's Republic of China, India, Indonesia and Thailand, are hereby repealed and the proceeding concerning these imports is terminated.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 10 February 2004.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nC.

of 26 July 2000

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member State's laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case, personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations, and in respect of given conditions. The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data established under that Directive has issued guidance on the making of such assessments(2).
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) As regards the Swiss Confederation, the legal standards on the protection of personal data have binding legal effect at both Federal and cantonal level.
(6) The Federal Constitution, which was amended by referendum on 18 April 1999 and which entered into force on 1 January 2000, gives every person the right to have his privacy respected and, in particular, to be protected from the misuse of data concerning him. The Federal Court has, on the basis of the previous Constitution, which did not contain any such provision, developed a case-law laying down the general principles applicable to the processing of personal data concerning, in particular, the quality of the data processed, the right of access of the persons concerned, and the right to request the correction or destruction of data. These principles are binding both on the Federation and on each canton.
(7) The Swiss Data Protection Act of 19 June 1992 entered into force on 1 July 1993. The implementing rules for certain provisions of the Act concerning, in particular, the right of access of the persons concerned, the notification of processing operations to the independent supervisory authority, and the transfer of data to a foreign country were laid down by order of the Federal Council. The Act applies to the processing of personal data by Federal bodies and by the entire private sector, and to processing operations carried out by cantonal bodies pursuant to Federal law, where such processing is not subject to cantonal provisions on data protection.
(8) Most of the cantons have adopted legislation on data protection for the areas for which they are competent, in particular public hospitals, education, direct cantonal taxes and the police. In the remaining cantons, such data processing is governed by regulatory acts or by the principles of cantonal case-law. Whatever the source and content of the cantonal provisions, or even if no cantonal provisions exist, cantons must adhere to the constitutional principles. In their field of responsibility, the cantonal authorities may have to transfer personal data to public authorities in neighbouring countries, mainly for the purpose of mutual assistance to safeguard important public interests or, in the case of public hospitals, to protect the vital interest of the persons concerned.
(9) On 2 October 1997, Switzerland ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention No 108)(3), which aims to reinforce the protection of personal data and to ensure free circulation between the contracting parties, subject to any exceptions which these parties may provide for. Without being directly applicable, the Convention lays down the international commitments of both the Federation and the cantons. These commitments concern not only the basic principles of protection which each contracting party must implement in its internal law but also the mechanisms of cooperation between the contracting parties. In particular, the competent Swiss authorities must provide the authorities of the other contracting parties which so request with any information on the law and administrative practice regarding data protection, and with information on any specific instance of automatic processing of data. They must also assist any person residing abroad in exercising his right to be informed about the existence of processing operations on data concerning him, the right to access his data or to ask for them to be corrected or deleted, and the right of judicial remedy.
(10) The legal standards applicable in Switzerland cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, even if exceptions and limitations are also provided for in order to safeguard important public interests. The application of these standards is guaranteed by judicial remedy and by independent supervision carried out by the authorities, such as the Federal Commissioner invested with powers of investigation and intervention. Furthermore, the provisions of Swiss law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned.
(11) In the interests of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify in this Decision the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(12) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered Opinions on the level of protection provided by Swiss law which have been taken into account in the preparation of this Decision(4).
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC,","{'title': '2000/518/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data provided in Switzerland (notified under document number C(2000) 2304) (Text with EEA relevance.)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of Article 25(2) of Directive 95/46/EC, for all the activities falling within the scope of that Directive, Switzerland is considered as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the Community.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision concerns only the adequacy of protection provided in Switzerland with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC and does not affect other conditions or restrictions implementing other provisions of that Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) The development of nuclear medicine within the European Union contributes to the objective of ensuring human health protection. It necessitates the increased use of testing reactors for medical purposes.
(2) On 19 February 2004, the Council adopted a Decision concerning the adoption of a supplementary research programme to be implemented by the Joint Research Centre for the European Atomic Energy Community (1). That programme was adopted for a period of three years, until 1 January 2007.
(3) Within the framework of the European Research Area, the supplementary research programme involving the high flux reactor at Petten (the HFR) is one of the principal means available in the Union to contribute to the support and testing of medical diagnostic and therapeutic methods, to the development of materials sciences and to problem-solving in the field of nuclear energy.
(4) The HFR is in operable condition until at least 2015, and a new operating licence was granted to the reactor operator in February 2005. The supplementary research programme should therefore be extended for a further year to make use of the technical facilities available. The extension should take effect retroactively, to cover the ongoing activities of the programme in the period from 1 January 2007.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 12 April 1994 concerning aid to be granted by Spain to the public integrated steel company Corporaciรณn de la Siderurgia Integral (Only the Spanish text is authentic) (94/258/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular the first and second paragraphs of Article 95 thereof,
Afte consulting the Consultative Committee and with the unanimous assent of the Council,
Whereas:
I  The Community steel industry is currently experiencing its most difficult period since the first half of the 1980s. This is due to the general slowdown in the economy, which has had a significant effect on industrial activities in general, and on the  steel industry in particular, leading to a serious imbalance between supply and demand, accompanied by a collapse in prices. In addition, the international market generally has been weak: there is pressure from imports and there has been a trade dispute  with the USA affecting substantial Community exports to that market. All of these factors have combined to aggravate the financial situation of almost all steel companies in the Community.
II  In April 1992, Spain notified the Commission of a plan to restructure the Spanish public integrated steel company Corporaciรณn de la Siderurgia Integral (CSI) (incorporating Ensidesa and Altos Hornos de Vizcaya (AHV)) and the associated financing by  which it intends to support this plan.
The restructuring plan submitted, as subsequently revised, envisages that AHV and Ensidesa would cease to operate and their activities would be taken over by a new company, to whom their assets and certain liabilities would be transferred; and includes  a number of industrial, commercial, social and financial restructuring measures, which would be completed by the end of 1998.
The plan provides for the definitive closure by the end of 1995 of all AHV's steel-making facilities including the hot-strip mill at Ansio, which together with closures at Ensidesa's plant will involve a total capacity reduction of 2,33 million tonnes  (35 %) in pig iron, 1,423 million tonnes (20 %) in liquid steel and 2,3 million tonnes (50 %) in hot-rolled coil.
A new company with majority private sector participation is envisaged to take forward a proposed investment in a compact-strip production unit at Sestao (with a capacity of 1 million tonnes), partially to replace the Ansio hot-strip mill.
The plan envisages a reduction in the workforce of 10 347 persons from 24 489 in 1991 to 14 142 in 1998, i.e. a reduction of 42 %.
The financing of the plan, as revised, includes aid elements that are incompatible with the ECSC Treaty and with the provisions of Commission Decision No 3855/91/ECSC (1) (Steel Aid Code). According to the Commission's estimates this aid amounts to a  maximum of Pta 437,8 billion, serving the following purposes:
- a capital injection of up to a maximum of Pta 276,7 billion in the new company by the former public shareholders of AHV and Ensidesa,
- social aid up to a maximum of Pta 54,519 billion,
- up to a maximum of Pta 35,5 billion in the form of capital conversion of an INI credit for that amount to Ensidesa,
- up to a maximum of Pta 9,4 billion to cover contingencies,
- up to a maximum of Pta 61,654 billion in the form of loss compensation to cover additional operating losses and financial charges in 1992 and 1993 over and above those originally forecast in the plan, and reduced turnover arising from bringing forward  the Ansio closure.
Additional social aid up to a maximum of Pta 47,35 billion, is being authorized separately by the Commission as compatible with Article 4 (1) of Decision No 3855/91/ECSC.
III  The Commission, assisted by external experts, has assessed the viability of the restructuring plan, applying the same criteria as those imposed by the Commission during the previous restructuring of the Community steel industry. The viability if  the plan without the Sestao investment has also been assessed. On the basis of the consultants' findings, the Commission has concluded that, provided the restructuring plan as revised is implemented strictly, the new company should achieve viability,  under normal market conditions, by the end of 1996.
IV  The extremely difficult Community steel market situation has endangered the sector in several Member States, including Spain. The aim of providing the Spanish public integrated steel industry with a sound and economically viable structure  contributes towards the achievement of the objectives of the ECSC Treaty, in particular Articles 2 and 3. The Commission considers that the public financial assistance measures proposed by Spain are necessary to achieve these aims. The Commission  therefore finds itself faced with a situation not specifically provided for in the Treaty. In these exceptional circumstances recourse must be made to the first paragraph of Article 95 of the Treaty, so as to enable the Community to pursue the  objectives set out in the initial Articles thereof.
At the same time, however, it is essential to ensure that the aid approved is limited to what is absolutely necessary and that it does not adversely affect trading conditions within the Community to an extent contrary to the common interest,  particularly given the current difficulties on the Community steel market. It is therefore important that there should be adequate counterpart measures, commensurate with the amount of aid being exceptionally approved, so that a major contribution is  made to the structural adjustment required in the sector.
V  The proposed creation of new hot-rolling capacity at Sestao (partially to replace the hot-strip mill at Ansio) is regarded as delinked from the aided restructuring plan through the creation of a new company, with majority private sector  participation, to take forward the project. However, it must be ensured that the majority private sector participation is genuine and unconditional, unsupported by State aid. The authorization of aid in this case will therefore be contingent on the  Commission obtaining the necessary verifications in due course.
As regards the capacity reductions envisaged under the plan, as revised, it is necessary to require that all the closures are definitive and irreversible so that the capacity concerned no longer depresses the Community steel market. The closed  installations must therefore be scrapped or sold for use outside Europe. In addition, there should be no increase in remaining capacity for crude steel and hot-rolled finished products under the aided restructuring plan, other than resulting from  productivity improvements, for a period of at least five years starting from the date of the last capacity closure, or of the last payment of aid in respect of investments under the plan, whichever is the later, in order to ensure a long-term and real  effect on reducing the current imbalance between supply and demand on the Community steel market. It is also essential that the timetable for closures in complied with. In particular the closure of the hot-strip mill at Ansio must be achieved at the  very latest by 31 December 1995, although Spain should use its best endeavours to bring forward the closure even sooner if possible.
VI  It is not only necessary to ensure during the whole restructuring period that the aid approved enables the company to return to viability by the end of 1996, the aid must also be kept to the amount strictly necessry. In that contextx, it must also  be ensured that the company does not, as a result of the financial restructuring measures, obtain an unfair advantage over other companies in the sector by being provided at the outset with net financial charges below 3,5 % of annual turnover, which is  the current average for Community steel companies. It is also appropriate to require that the company or its legal successor is not allowed to claim or be granted tax reduction or relief on past losses covered by aid under the restructuring and that all  proceeds from the sale of shares in the new company to the former public shareholders of AHV and Ensidesa are used to repay the remaining debts of the dormant companies as provided for in the restructuring plan. Furthermore any additional loans must be  on normal commercial conditions and no preferential treatment accorded to any fresh public debts incurred.
VII  The implementation of this Decision requires strict monitoring by the Commission during the whole restructuring period and up until the end of 1998.
In order to carry out this monitoring effectively, the Commission will require the full and close collaboration of Spain, on whom clear and strict reporting obligations will be imposed.
In particular the following elements will require close attention:
- the reduction of capacity,
- the investments carried out,
- reductions in the workforce,
- compliance with the timetable for closures,
- production and the effects on the market,
- financial performance,
- privatization,
- the creation of new enterprises,
- the guenine character of the majority private sector participation and the absence of State aid to finance the Sestao project,
- the source, terms and conditions of any further financing (including treatment of further debts, credit facilities, etc). over and above that provided for in the plan,
- progress towards viability.
The Commission will submit six-monthly reports to the Council to keep it informed of developments.
It is also necessary to ensure that the aid is not used for the purpose of unfair competition practices. In addition the Commission may require on-the-spot checks made in accordance with the Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty, in order to verify the  information provided and in particular compliance with the conditions attached to the authorization of the aid. In that context, should a Member State make a complaint to the Commission that State aid is enabling the company to under-price, the  Commission will initiate an investigation pursuant to Article 60 of the ECSC Treaty in particular.
Furthermore, should the Commission, on the basis of the information provided, find that the conditions laid down in its decisions pursuant to Article 95 had not been met, it may require the suspension of payments of aid or the recovery of aid already  paid. In the event of a Member State's failing to comply with such decision, Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty shall apply.
The Commission may decide that all reports should be on a quarterly basis. It may also decide to mandate an independent consultant, selected with the agreement of Spain, to assist it in its monitoring task.
The Commission will, by exercising all its powers, ensure that the aided company fulfils the conditions of this Decision, including the necessary progress towards viability and its other obligations resulting from the financial data on which the  viability assessment has been made, the Commission may require appropriate measures to be taken to reinforce the restructuring measures.
VIII  A decision pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty to authorize State aid is extraordinary in character given the provisions of Article 4 (c). In view of all the above, the Commission can exceptionally authorize the aid proposed in this case  subject to observance of the conditions and requirements it lays down. However, the aid involved, which is intended to restore the company to viability by the end of 1996, should be regarded as final. Should a return to viability not be achieved by that  date, Spain shall not request any further derogation under Article 95 for the company,","{'title': '94/258/ECSC: Commission Decision of 12 April 1994 concerning aid to be granted by Spain to the public integrated steel company Corporación de la Siderurgia Integral (Only the Spanish text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 24 January 2006
providing macro-financial assistance to Georgia
(2006/41/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 97/787/EC (2) the Council provided exceptional financial assistance for Armenia and Georgia in the form of long-term loans and grants.
(2) By Decision 2000/244/EC the Council provided exceptional financial assistance for Tajikistan and extended the implementation period of the assistance to Armenia and Georgia until 2004.
(3) In case of Georgia, the objectives of the assistance have not been fully met, owing to an unsatisfactory economic policy environment in the country during most of the implementation period.
(4) Therefore, only EUR 31,5 million of the total grant component of EUR 65 million for Georgia was committed and paid under the exceptional financial assistance.
(5) The present authorities of Georgia are committed to economic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) which was approved on 4 June 2004 for a total amount of SDR 98 million. Subsequently, the Paris Club creditors agreed on 21 July 2004 to a restructuring of Georgia’s bilateral official debt on the Houston terms.
(6) The new Government of Georgia also received strong support from the international community at the donors’ conference held in Brussels on 16 June 2004.
(7) The World Bank approved in June 2004 a USD 24 million Reform Support Credit, and will continue its assistance to Georgia under a new Country Partnership Strategy in the form of Poverty Reduction Support Operations.
(8) The Georgian authorities have expressed their intention to pursue early debt repayments to the Community with a view to improving debt sustainability.
(9) As EU-Georgia relations are developing within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is expected to lead to deeper economic integration, Community support for the government’s economic reform programme is considered appropriate.
(10) Making available an amount equivalent to the uncommitted grant component of the exceptional financial assistance, which would support the country’s economic reforms and help reduce external indebtedness, is an appropriate contribution by the Community to the implementation of poverty reduction and growth strategies in Georgia.
(11) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Community’s financial interests in connection with the present macro-financial assistance, it is necessary to provide for appropriate measures by Georgia in relation to the prevention of and the fight against fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, as well as for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors.
(12) The Commission services, with the support of duly mandated external experts, carried out in October 2004 an operational assessment of the financial circuits and administrative procedures at the Ministry of Finance of Georgia and the National Bank of Georgia to ascertain the existence of a framework for sound financial management.
(13) The release of this grant assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.
(14) The Commission has consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal.
(15) The Treaty provides for no powers, other than those of Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Decision,","{'header': '28.1.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 25/28', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 24 January 2006\nproviding macro-financial assistance to Georgia\n(2006/41/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 97/787/EC(2)the Council provided exceptional financial assistance for Armenia and Georgia in the form of long-term loans and grants.\n\n((2)) By Decision 2000/244/EC the Council provided exceptional financial assistance for Tajikistan and extended the implementation period of the assistance to Armenia and Georgia until 2004.\n\n((3)) In case of Georgia, the objectives of the assistance have not been fully met, owing to an unsatisfactory economic policy environment in the country during most of the implementation period.\n\n((4)) Therefore, only EUR 31,5 million of the total grant component of EUR 65 million for Georgia was committed and paid under the exceptional financial assistance.\n\n((5)) The present authorities of Georgia are committed to economic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) which was approved on 4 June 2004 for a total amount of SDR 98 million.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Articles 7(3), 11(3), 19(3) and 23(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 17 April 2007, Syngenta Seeds SAS on behalf of Syngenta Crop Protection AG, submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 5, 11, 17 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing foods and food ingredients produced from Bt11 maize (including food additives), and renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing feed containing, consisting of or produced from Bt11 maize (including feed additives and feed materials) and products other than food and feed containing and consisting of Bt11 maize with the exception of cultivation (the application) which were previously notified in accordance with Article 8(1)(a)(b) and Article 20(1)(a)(b) of that Regulation. The application also covers the renewal of the authorisation for the placing on the market of foods and food ingredients which are authorised under Commission Decision 2004/657/EC of 19 May 2004 authorising the placing on the market of sweet corn from genetically modified maize line Bt11 as a novel food or novel food ingredient under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). Within its application, Syngenta Seeds SAS also requested the authorisation of foods and food ingredients containing or consisting of Bt11 field maize which were never authorised in the Union.
(2) On 17 February 2009, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion (3) in accordance with Article 6 and Article 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that the new information provided in the application and the review of the literature that has been published since the previous scientific opinion on Bt11 maize (4) by EFSA does not require changes and confirmed the previous conclusion that Bt11 maize is as safe as its non-genetically modified counterpart and that it is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed uses which also applies to the products which are subject of the application.
(3) In its opinion, EFSA considered all the specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities as provided for by Article 6(4) and Article 18(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(4) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(5) Taking into account these considerations, the fact that the company Syngenta Crop Protection AG Switzerland which absorbed Syngenta Seeds AG, addressee of Decision 2004/657/EC is the same legal entity, on behalf of which the applicant asked for the renewal of authorisation, that it confirmed that the scope of its application also covers the request for authorisation of foods and food ingredients containing or consisting of Bt11 field maize and that it intended to ask for a renewal of products covered by Decision 2004/657/EC prior to the expiration of the authorisation mentioned in that Decision so that a single Decision covering these products may be adopted which will take effect on the same date, renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of the existing products, renewal of the authorisation of foods and food ingredients containing, consisting of or produced from Bt11 sweet maize (sweet maize fresh or canned) and authorisation of food and foods ingredients containing or consisting of Bt11 field maize should be granted. Consequently, Decision 2004/657/EC should be repealed.
(6) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (5).
(7) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Article 13(1) and Article 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, appear to be necessary for foods, food ingredients and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from Bt11 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of the authorisation provided for by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and products other than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which renewal of the authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(8) The authorisation holder should submit annual reports on the implementation and the results of the activities set out in the monitoring plan for environmental effects. Those results should be presented in accordance with Commission Decision 2009/770/EC of 13 October 2009 establishing standard reporting formats for presenting the monitoring results of the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, as or in products, for the purpose of placing on the market, pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).
(9) The EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements for the use of the food and feed, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in Article 6(5)(e) and Article 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(10) All relevant information on the authorisation or the renewal of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(11) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (7), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of, or containing GMOs.
(12) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (8).
(13) The applicant has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision.
(14) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman.
(15) At its meeting on 29 June 2010, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. The Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,","{'header': '29.7.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 197/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 28 July 2010\nrenewing the authorisation for continued marketing of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize Bt11 (SYN-BTØ11-1), authorising foods and food ingredients containing or consisting of field maize Bt11 (SYN-BTØ11-1) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Decision 2004/657/EC\n(notified under document C(2010) 5129)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/419/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 17 April 2007, Syngenta Seeds SAS on behalf of Syngenta Crop Protection AG, submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 5, 11, 17 and 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing foods and food ingredients produced from Bt11 maize (including food additives), and renewal of the authorisation for continued marketing of existing feed containing, consisting of or produced from Bt11 maize (including feed additives and feed materials) and products other than food and feed containing and consisting of Bt11 maize with the exception of cultivation (the application) which were previously notified in accordance with Article 8(1)(a)(b) and Article 20(1)(a)(b) of that Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund For Rural Development (EAFRD) (1) and in particular Article 91 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 established a single legal framework for the EAFRD support for rural development throughout the Community. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 (2) complemented that framework by introducing detailed implementing rules.
(2) Article 38(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 specifies that for payments linked to Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (3), detailed rules, including the maximum amount of support, are to be fixed.
(3) Pursuant to Article 11(7) of Directive 2000/60/EC, Member States are obliged to establish a programme of measures for each river basin district by 22 December 2009. In accordance with Article 11(2) of that Directive, these measures have to comprise basic measures, including those already required to implement Union legislation for the protection of water, as referred to in Article 11(3) of that Directive and, where necessary, supplementary measures, as referred to in Article 11(4), which may consist in any of the types of measures listed in Part B of Annex VI to that Directive or in other types of measure not listed in that Annex. While voluntary measures and certain mandatory measures may already be supported under Articles 31 and 39 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, detailed rules for the implementation of Article 38(2) of that Regulation need to be defined to cover other mandatory measures.
(4) In view to avoid overlapping between the meeting standards support as referred to in Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005, on the one hand, which aims at compensating beneficiaries’ temporary disadvantages due to the obligation to adapt to Union standards in certain fields, and the payment under Article 38 of that Regulation linked to Directive 2000/60/EC on the other hand, which aims at compensating beneficiaries permanent disadvantages due to the obligation to comply with the specific requirements for achieving the environmental objectives of that Directive, provision making distinction on the basis of the types of operations concerned should be made.
(5) Directive 2000/60/EC provides common principles and the framework for Union action in the field of water policy. The whole Union legislation on water is coordinated in the framework of that Directive which repealed and replaced several water Directives, and whose ‘programmes of measures’ contain measures which are provided for by previous Directives on water still in force as well as additional measures needed to achieve the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC itself. In the light of that, since part of the requirements formally related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC result in substance from other Union legislation for the protection of water, and have or should already have been implemented by the Member States, the costs and income foregone possibly occurring at present as a consequence of the application of those requirements should not be considered as eligible for compensation. In addition, Article 4(9) of Directive 2000/60/EC provides that the application of the new provisions of that Directive should guarantee at least the same level of protection as the existing Community legislation. Therefore, it seems proportional and appropriate to exclude compensation of costs and income foregone with reference to the requirements related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC resulting from other Union legislation for the protection of water, as well as to only grant support for requirements that go beyond the level of protection of the Union legislation existing at the time that Directive was adopted.
(6) In addition, part of the legislation related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC is already included in cross compliance. Beneficiaries of the payments under Article 38 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 are already obliged to respect the statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental condition provided for respectively in Articles 5 and 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (4) which has established common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy as well as certain support schemes for farmers, and in Annexes II and III to that Regulation. Therefore, no compensation should be granted with reference to requirements related to the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC which are also cross compliance requirements.
(7) As a consequence of the implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC different levels of constraints for farmers may be introduced. Permanent compensation should be allowed only in case of serious disadvantages.
(8) The maximum amount of support should be fixed. In addition, a minimum amount of permanent support should be set to reflect that compensation should be granted only in cases of serious disadvantage, and provision should be made for going beyond the maximum amount taking account of specific circumstances to be justified in the rural development programmes.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 of 26 October 1971 on the common organisation of the market in seeds(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1405/1999(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under the above Regulation, Finland may, subject to authorisation by the Commission, grant aid for certain quantities of seeds produced solely in Finland because of its specific climatic conditions.
(2) In 1995, Finland notified a draft Decision granting State aid for the production of certain forage seeds. That aid was authorised for 1995 by Commission Decision 95/282/EC of 17 July 1995 on Finnish State aid for seeds(3). The Decision authorised State aid for up to a maximum of the average areas cultivated in Finland over the period 1989 to 1993, and covering estimated domestic requirements in 1995, for red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis huds.), cocksfoot (Dactilis glomerata L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Authorisation was given for varieties listed in Finland's national catalogue and which, except for small quantities cultivated in regions bordering on Finland, are produced solely in that Member State.
(3) The Finnish authorities were to send the Commission a report on the application of Decision 95/282/EC by 30 April 1996. The report was sent on 26 October 1998. Technical discussions were held between the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Commission on the report, covering the amounts of aid actually granted, the area cultivated and the production and marketing of each species and variety for which aid was granted.
(4) Finland adopted the maximum areas laid down by Decision 95/282/EC and set maximum amounts of aid for 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 on the basis that the income of producers, after receipt of the aid, should be no more than the average income of producers during the reference period from 1989 to 1993. Except for 1999, the amounts of aid were calculated and paid to producers.
(5) According to the information sent by the Finnish authorities, Finland applied Decision 95/282/EC for the 1995 to 1999 marketing years. The areas of red clover for which State aid was paid exceeded the limits laid down by the Commission in 1995 from 1997 onwards. The same occurred with meadow fescue and ryegrass in 1998. The amounts of State aid for the species concerned were reduced proportionally.
(6) The fact that State aid was set and paid to producers beyond the period authorised by the Commission makes the aid illegal, but not necessarily incompatible with the second paragraph of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71.
(7) On the basis of the information supplied by the Finnish Government, the Commission noted that, from 1 January 1996 to 1998, the Finnish aid was paid for varieties of seed produced in Finland because of its specific climatic conditions. The Commission also noted that, with regard to the period 1996 to 1998, the overrun, from 1997 for red clover and from 1998 for meadow fescue and ryegrass, of the maximum areas for which aid could be granted for 1995 laid down by the Commission was offset by a proportional reduction in the amount of aid. The calculations for 1999 have not yet been finalised, but a maximum amount has been set for the aid.
(8) Under these circumstances, the Commission can authorise the aid retrospectively for the period from 1996 to 1998 and authorise the maximum amount of aid for 1999 within the limit of the maximum area laid down by Decision 95/282/EC for the species other than red clover, the maximum authorised area of which should be increased by 300 hectares compared with that for the 1995 marketing year to take account of an increase in demand and the absence on the market of varieties suited to the specific climatic conditions of Finland,","{'title': '2000/148/EC: Commission Decision of 11 February 2000 on Finnish State aid for seeds (notified under document number C(2000) 358) (Only the Finnish and Swedish texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe aid granted by Finland, without prior authorisation from the Commission, from 1 January 1996 to 1998 within the limits of the areas and amounts laid down in the Annex for certified seeds of varieties of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis huds.), cocksfoot (Dactilis glomerata L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) listed in Finland's national catalogue and which, except for small quantities cultivated in regions bordering on Finland, are produced solely in that Member State is compatible with the second paragraph of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 and is therefore authorised.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThe maximum amounts of aid or lower amounts set by Finland, without prior authorisation from the Commission, for 1999 within the limits of the areas and amounts laid down in the Annex for certified seeds of varieties of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), timothy (Phleum pratense L.), meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis huds.), cocksfoot (Dactilis glomerata L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) listed in Finland's national catalogue and which, except for small quantities cultivated in regions bordering on Finland, are produced solely in that Member State are compatible with the second paragraph of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2358/71 and are therefore authorised.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Finland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 February 2000.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz FISCHLER\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 246, 5.11.1971, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 164, 30.6.1999, p. 17.\n\n(3) OJ L 173, 25.7.1995, p. 58.\n\nANNEX\n\nA.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning medical devices(1), as amended by Directive 98/79/EC(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society Services(3), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC(4),
Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of Directive 93/42/EEC stipulates that medical devices may be placed on the market and put into service only if, when normally used, they do not compromise the safety of persons.
(2) Under Article 5 of Directive 93/42/EEC, medical devices are presumed to comply with the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 of that Directive if they conform to the national standards applicable to them transposing the harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(3) Member States are required to publish the reference numbers of national standards transposing harmonised standards the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(4) Germany raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standard EN 1970:2000 ""Adjustable beds for disabled persons - Requirements and test methods"", adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) in 2000, the reference number of which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 14 November 2001(5), on the grounds that it does not fully satisfy the essential requirements of Directive 93/42/EEC, especially those relating to electrical safety, and that, in some cases, a dangerous situation can occur causing death or serious injury.
(5) On the basis of the information received in the framework of a consultation of national authorities, no specific evidence was indicated to substantiate the risk of fire in hospital beds in other Member States.
(6) Recently reported information from France indicates a number of accidents involving hospital beds, but details of the causes have not been established.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 724/75 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Fund Regulation"") provides, independently of the national allocations of resources fixed by Article 2 (3) (a) of that Regulation, for participation by the Fund in financing specific Community regional development measures which are in particular linked with Community policies and with measures adopted by the Community in order to take better account of their regional dimension or to reduce their regional consequences;
Whereas, pursuant to that Article, the Council adopted on 7 October 1980 an initial series of Regulations instituting specific Community regional development measures and in particular Regulation (EEC) No 2618/80 (6) instituting a specific Community regional development measure contributing to improving security of energy supply in certain Community regions by way of improved use of new techniques for hydro-electrical power and alternative energy sources, this measure being hereinafter referred to as ""the specific measure"";
Whereas, pursuant to that Regulation and in particular Article 3 thereof, the Commission has approved a special programme relating to certain areas in the Mezzogiorno and has at the same time decided to allocate appropriations to that programme;
Whereas Greece has become a Member of the Community since the adoption of the specific measure ; whereas the situation in that country is also characterized by a substantial energy shortfall and heavy dependence on oil imports ; whereas, moreover, the cost of energy is particularly high in the Greek islands;
Whereas the development of those islands entails increased consumption of energy, which also stems from the operation of the water supply systems serving agriculture, industry and tourism ; whereas there is therefore a need to encourage the installation there of new generating capacity exploiting local alternative energy sources;
Whereas steps should be taken to promote the exploitation of geothermal energy, which is an important alternative source of energy in these areas ; whereas similar steps should also be taken in the areas of the Mezzogiorno affected by the specific measure;
Whereas the Member States concerned have provided the Commission with information on regional problems which would be a suitable subject for a specific Community measure;
Whereas, in order to accelerate the implementation of the special programme, the rules laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 2618/80 concerning budgetary commitments, payment of aid from the Fund and advances made from the Fund should be amended;  (1) OJ No L 73, 21.3.1975, p. 1.

Whereas, in order that Greece may benefit fully from the specific measure, it is appropriate to provide that the expenditure connected with the measures envisaged and carried out by that country pending the adoption of this Regulation, during the year preceding its adoption, be, by way of an exception, deemed eligible;
Whereas additional financial resources are required to implement the specific measure thus reinforced and extended to new areas;

Whereas:
(1) The first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Directive’) provides that the Commission shall commence a 10-year work programme for the systematic examination of all active substances already on the market on 14 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the review programme’).
(2) Temephos was identified as available on the market before 14 May 2000 as an active substance of biocidal products for purposes other than those referred to in Article 2(2)(c) and (d) of Directive 98/8/EC. No dossier was submitted in support of the inclusion of temephos in Annex I, IA or IB to the Directive within the prescribed deadline.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2032/2003 (3), Member States had to cancel existing authorisations or registrations for biocidal products containing temephos with effect from 1 September 2006. Pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Regulation’), biocidal products containing temephos shall no longer be placed on the market.
(4) Article 5 of the Regulation lays down the conditions under which Member States may apply to the Commission for derogation from the provision laid down in Article 4(1) of the Regulation and the conditions for granting such derogation.
(5) By Commission Decision 2007/226/EC (4), the Commission granted such derogation for biocidal products containing temephos used for vector mosquito control in the French overseas departments. The derogation was granted until 14 May 2009.
(6) France has submitted an application to the Commission for extension of the derogation until 14 May 2010, together with information demonstrating a need for further use of temephos. The Commission made the French application publicly available by electronic means on 13 February 2009. No concern was expressed during the 60-days public consultation period against this application.
(7) With regard to the magnitude of the outbreaks of mosquito-spread diseases in the French overseas departments, it is appropriate to continue allowing the use of temephos in situations where treatment with other substances or biocidal products is not efficient. A further extension of the phase-out period for this substance seems, therefore, necessary to allow for its replacement by other suitable substances,","{'header': '20.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 124/65', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 May 2009\nconcerning the placing on the market for essential use of biocidal products containing temephos in the French overseas departments\n(notified under document number C(2009) 3744)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(2009/395/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The first subparagraph of Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Directive’) provides that the Commission shall commence a 10-year work programme for the systematic examination of all active substances already on the market on 14 May 2000 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the review programme’).\n\n((2)) Temephos was identified as available on the market before 14 May 2000 as an active substance of biocidal products for purposes other than those referred to in Article 2(2)(c) and (d) of Directive 98/8/EC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV(6) negotiations(2), and in particular Article 1(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Schedule CXL requires an annual import quota to be opened for 53000 tonnes of frozen beef covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206 29 91. Implementing rules should be laid down for the 2001/02 quota year starting on 1 July 2001.
(2) For the allocation of the quota the method laid down in the third indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 should be applied, avoiding discrimination between the traders concerned. Access to the quota should therefore be extended to those traders known as ""new arrivals"".
(3) Traditional importers should consequently be allocated 70 % of the quota, i.e. 37100 tonnes, in proportion to the quantities imported by them under the same type of quota during the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 2000. In certain cases administrative errors by the competent national body are liable to restrict traders' access to this part of the quota. Steps should be taken to make good any resulting damage.
(4) Traders who can show that they are genuinely involved in trade of some significance should be granted access to the second part of the quota, i.e. 15900 tonnes, in accordance with a procedure whereby the parties concerned submit applications to be accepted by the Commission. Proof of genuine involvement in trade calls for evidence to be presented of trade of some significance in beef and veal with non-member countries during the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2000.
(5) In 1999 Belgian beef and veal exports were severely affected by discussion of dioxin. As far as the figure of 15900 tonnes is concerned, Belgium's situation as regards exports should be taken into account when the criteria relating to results are determined.
(6) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be submitted in the Member State where the importer is entered in the national VAT register.
(7) In order to prevent speculation:
- traders no longer involved in trade in beef and veal at 1 June 2001 should be denied access to the quota,
- a security relating to import rights should be fixed,
- the possibility of transferring import licences should be excluded,
- the issue of import licences to traders should be limited to the import rights allocated to them.
(8) To oblige traders to apply for import licences for all the import rights allocated, it should be established that obligation constitutes a primary requirement within the meaning of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1932/1999(4).
(9) Save as otherwise provided in this Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products(5) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 24/2001(7), are applicable to import licences issued under this Regulation.
(10) Effective management of the quota and fraud prevention in particular require used licences to be returned to the competent authorities so they can check that the quantities shown therein are correct. The competent authorities must accordingly be under an obligation to carry out such checks. The security to be lodged when licences are issued should be fixed at a level that ensures licences are actually used and returned to the competent authorities.

Whereas, in order to facilitate the changeover from the system of aid for seed flax to the new system of aid for linseed set up by Regulation (EEC) No 569/76, Article 2 (2) of that Regulation laid down that the aid for linseed for seed flax for the 1976/77 marketing year could not be less than 125 units of account per hectare;

Whereas in accordance with these criteria the guide price should be fixed at a higher level than that adopted for the preceding marketing year;

Whereas, in the context of a common policy relating to the field of science and technology, research programmes are one of the principal means whereby the European Atomic Energy Community can contribute to the safe use of nuclear energy and to the acquisition and dissemination of information in this field;
Whereas the Joint Research Centre (JRC), as an integral component of the Community's R & D strategy defined in the framework programme, must retain its institutional role of providing the Commission with neutral and independent scientific and technical support in the implementation of Community policies;
Whereas, whilst contributing to the general objective of strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European industry and encouraging it to become more competitive at international level, the JRC has as one of its tasks, in accordance with its terms of reference and on the basis of its technical expertise, to advise the Commission when laying down technical regulations and standards for the development and application of new technologies, on the environmental compatibility of such technologies and their possible negative effects on the quality of life;
Whereas, for the period covered by this Decision, the implementation of the specific research programmes will continue to be the JRC's predominant task, although the use of other forms of action will occupy an increasingly important part of the JRC's activity;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Council has concluded a Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1), hereinafter referred to as ‘the Agreement’;
Whereas it is necessary to lay down the procedures for applying certain provisions of the Agreement;
Whereas the Agreement stipulates that certain products originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia may be imported into the Community, within the limits of tariff quotas or tariff ceilings or in the framework of reference quantities, at a reduced or a zero rate of customs duty; whereas the Agreement already specifies the products eligible for those tariff measures, their volumes and annual increase of the volumes, their duties, periods and any eligibility criteria; whereas amendments to the Combined Nomenclature and Taric codes and adaptations arising from the conclusion of agreements, protocols or exchanges of letters between the Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia do not involve changes of substance; whereas, in the interest of simplicity, provision should therefore be made for the Commission, assisted by the Customs Code Committee, to adopt the implementing regulations opening and providing for the administration of the tariff quotas and tariff ceilings, to establish the Community statistical surveillance system for imports in the framework of reference quantities as well as to make the necessary amendments and technical adaptations to the annexes of the implementing Regulations;
Whereas the Agreement provides for the Community to have the possibility to replace a reference quantity by an equal tariff ceiling when a reference quantity is exceeded; whereas in these circumstances, provision should be made for the Commission to adopt the necessary measures;
Whereas, as soon as a tariff ceiling is reached, the Community may reintroduce, until the end of the calendar year, the customs duties applicable to third countries in respect of the product concerned; whereas, with a view to protecting the interests of Community producers, those measures may need to be adopted on a very short timescale; whereas the Agreement provides for the Community to have the possibility to suspend a tariff ceiling if, during two consecutive years, imports of a product listed in Annex C thereto have been less than 80 % of the ceiling volume; whereas the Agreement also provides for the Community to have the possibility to extend for a period of one year the ceiling or ceilings set for the preceding year if it is considered appropriate to postpone the annual increase by 5 % of the ceiling volume; whereas provision should therefore be made for the Commission to adopt those measures rapidly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 77/98 of 9 January 1998 on certain procedures for applying the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nProvisions for the application of Article 15(2) of the Agreement, concerning cattle, sheep and goats and beef, sheepmeat, goatmeat and sour cherries, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 27 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (2) or in the corresponding provisions of other regulations establishing a common organization of the agricultural markets.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

(4) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1859/93(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1662/94(8), provides that garlic may be released for free circulation in the Community on presentation of import licences issued by the Member States concerned.

(2) The product under review is chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80 % MgO, whether or not containing magnesite originating in the People’s Republic of China (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815910010, 6815991020 and 6815999020). These CN codes are given only for information.
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China, including the product concerned produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 39,9 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures.
(5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.
E.   PROCEDURE
(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above mentioned application and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determining whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation and, if so, the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.
(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005.
(a) Questionnaires
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(c) Market economy status
(d) Selection of the market economy country
F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicants, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mention in Article 4(1) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,
— interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which, in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy status, is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China,
— the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy status.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and use of facts available is made, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 lays down that the quantities of cereals eligible for the refund shall be the quantities placed under control and distilled, weighted by a coefficient to be fixed annually for each Member State concerned. The coefficient shall express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question. On the basis of the information supplied by Ireland on the period from 1 January to 31 December 2002, the average ageing period in 2002 was five years for Irish whiskey. The coefficients for the period from 1 October 2003 to 30 September 2004 should therefore be fixed accordingly.
(2) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area(5) precludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Community has concluded with certain third countries agreements abolishing export refunds. According to Article 7(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93, this should be taken into account in the calculation of the coefficients for the period 2003/2004.

(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals.

Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n\n((8)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, are fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 17 June 2005.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 17 June 2005 to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n1\n)\n(EUR/100\xa0kg)\nCN code\nDescription of products\n(\n2\n)\nRate of refund per 100\xa0kg of basic product\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\n1001\xa010\xa000\nDurum wheat:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1001\xa090\xa099\nCommon wheat and meslin:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n3\n)\n—\n—\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– – in other cases\n—\n—\n1002\xa000\xa000\nRye\n—\n—\n1003\xa000\xa090\nBarley\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1004\xa000\xa000\nOats\n—\n—\n1005\xa090\xa000\nMaize (corn) used in the form of:\n– starch:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n3\n)\n3,395\n3,543\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n1,975\n1,975\n– – in other cases\n4,222\n4,222\n– glucose, glucose syrup, maltodextrine, maltodextrine syrup of CN codes 1702\xa030\xa051 , 1702\xa030\xa059 , 1702\xa030\xa091 , 1702\xa030\xa099 , 1702\xa040\xa090 , 1702\xa090\xa050 , 1702\xa090\xa075 , 1702\xa090\xa079 , 2106\xa090\xa055\n(\n5\n)\n:\n– – where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n3\n)\n2,340\n2,488\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n1,481\n1,481\n– – in other cases\n3,167\n3,167\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n1,975\n1,975\n– other (including unprocessed)\n4,222\n4,222\nPotato starch of CN code 1108\xa013\xa000  similar to a product obtained from processed maize:\n– where Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 applies\n(\n3\n)\n3,146\n3,544\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n4\n)\nare exported\n1,975\n1,975\n– in other cases\n4,222\n4,222\nex\xa01006\xa030\nWholly milled rice:\n– round grain\n—\n—\n– medium grain\n—\n—\n– long grain\n—\n—\n1006\xa040\xa000\nBroken rice\n—\n—\n1007\xa000\xa090\nGrain sorghum, other than hybrid for sowing\n—\n—\n(\n1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to Bulgaria, with effect from 1 October 2004, and to the goods listed in Tables I and II to Protocol No 2 the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation or to the Principality of Liechtenstein with effect from1 February 2005.\n(\n2\n)\nAs far as agricultural products obtained from the processing of a basic product or/and assimilated products are concerned, the coefficients shown in Annex E to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 shall be applied (\nOJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1\n).\n(\n3\n)\nThe goods concerned fall in under CN code 3505\xa010\xa050.\n(\n4\n)\nGoods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 (\nOJ L 258, 16.10.1993, p. 6\n).\n(\n5\n)\nFor syrups of CN codes NC 1702\xa030\xa099, 1702\xa040\xa090 and 1702\xa060\xa090, obtained from mixing glucose and fructose syrup, the export refund may be granted only for the glucose syrup.'}]}"

Whereas with effect from 1 September 1995 Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 makes presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund compulsory for exportation of products on which an export refund is requested, whereas specific rules for the application of this provision in the wine sector should therefore be laid down, covering in particular the submission of applications and the information that must be given on applications and licences; whereas these rules will be complementary to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/95 (5);
Whereas Article 55 (7) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 requires compliance with the obligations regarding export volumes arising from agreements concluded as a result of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations to be ensured on the basis of export licences; whereas precise rules should therefore be laid down on the lodging of applications and issuing of licences;

Whereas the security for export licences must be set at a high enough level to ensure effective operation of the new arrangements;
Whereas to manage these arrangements the Commission must have precise information on licence applications lodged and use of licences issued; whereas administrative efficiency calls for the use of a single form for communications between Member States and the Commission;
