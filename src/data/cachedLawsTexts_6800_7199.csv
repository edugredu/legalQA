THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) Robenidine hydrochloride, CAS number 25875-50-7, was authorised for 10 years in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a coccidiostat for use on rabbits for breeding by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 (3) and for use on turkeys, chickens for fattening and rabbits for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1800/2004 (4). The additive was subsequently entered in the Register of Feed Additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of robenidine hydrochloride as a feed additive for rabbits for breeding and rabbits for fattening, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘coccidiostats and histomonostats’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 7 March 2011 that, under the proposed conditions of use, robenidine hydrochloride does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that the additive is effective in controlling coccidiosis in rabbits for fattening and for breeding (5). It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of robenidine hydrochloride shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of this preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) As a consequence of a new authorisation being granted by this Regulation, the entry in Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 concerning robenidine hydrochloride for rabbits for breeding purposes is deleted.
(7) As a further consequence of this new authorisation, the entry for robenidine hydrochloride in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1800/2004 should be amended.
(8) Since the modifications to the conditions of authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of pre-mixtures and compound feed containing this preparation, as authorised by Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 for use on rabbits for breeding purposes and by Regulation (EC) No 1800/2004 for use on rabbits for fattening.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to that Article,
Whereas:
I. Procedure
(1) By letter dated 28 April 1995, registered at the Commission on 7 June 1995, Italy notified Region of Sicily Law No 23 of 28 March 1995 on rules applicable to credit guarantee groups for small and medium-sized enterprises. By letters dated 12 January and 10 April 1996, registered at the Commission on 19 January and 22 April 1996, Italy sent the additional information asked for.
(2) On 12 June 1996, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 93(2) (now Article 88(2)) of the EC Treaty in regard to the abovementioned Regional Law. This provided for a mechanism to support fishery enterprises by facilitating their access to credit and certain financial services (factoring, leasing, collective guarantee). Through the agency of consortia of cooperatives (consorzi fidi) operating one or more separate funds it would be possible to guarantee or reduce the cost of certain financial operations carried out by their members. The Commission considered that the aid granted both at the time of creation and during the life of these consortia was incompatible with the common market. Firstly, the public contribution to the funds was to be free and unlimited in time. Not only was it not to be confined to start-up but successive injections of capital were planned in order to maintain the public contribution at at least 50 % of fund assets. Secondly, the Commission did not have enough information to assess the aid in its various forms of provision of guarantee, regional subsidisation of the costs of factoring and leasing contracts, guarantees for management loans and liability consolidation (see Commission letter SG(96) D/5784 of 26 June 1996 addressed to the Italian Government and published in Official Journal of the European Communities C 302 of 12 October 1996 (p. 6)).
(3) On 8 January 1998 and 21 December 1999, Italy provided the information asked for by the Commission. No comment from other Member States or interested parties was received.
II. Description
(4) The scheme introduced by the law was a support mechanism for fishery enterprises facilitating their access to credit and certain financial services (factoring, leasing, collective guarantee). Enterprises would be encouraged to group themselves through formation of a legal person in the form of a cooperative or consortium of cooperatives that would operate one or more separate funds to guarantee or reduce the cost of certain financial operations effected by its members.
III. The Italian Government's comments
(5) In its letter of 21 December 1999 Italy informed the Commission that no application for aid from the funds for fishery sector group risks had ever been received, i.e. the scheme had never actually been applied. Since the law in question provided for allocation of financial resources up to 1997, if the Region of Sicily wished to reintroduce the scheme, a new legislative measure specifically applicable to the cases indicated above would be required and would be the subject of a new notification to the Commission.
IV. Assessment
(6) It is clear from the information provided by Italy (see Section III) that the scheme has never been made use of in the fishery sector and that under the Law notified to the Commission it could not now be made use of at any time owing to the impossibility under that Law of any provision of finance from 1998 onwards.
Thus any activation of the scheme would have to be covered by notification of a new measure specifically applicable to the fishery sector.
The examination procedure initiated by the Commission for the scheme has therefore become pointless and the procedure should therefore be closed under Article 7(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 (now Article 88) of the EC Treaty (OJ L 83 of 27 March 1999, p. 1).
V. Conclusion
(7) Given the foregoing, the Commission considers that the examination procedure can be closed,","{'title': ""2000/610/EC: Commission Decision of 28 June 2000 on the aid scheme provided in Region of Sicily Law No 23 of 28 March 1995 'Rules applicable to credit guarantee groups for small and medium-sized enterprises' - fishery sector (notified under document number C(2000) 1962) (Text with EEA relevance) (Only the Italian text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe examination procedure initiated in regard to the section relating to fisheries of Region of Sicily Law No 23 of 28 March 1995 is hereby closed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 June 2000.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),

Having regard to the proposal submitted by the European Commission (‘the Commission’) after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011, the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Union of ceramic tiles originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘China’). Given the large number of cooperating exporting producers in China in the investigation that led to the imposition of the anti-dumping duty (‘the original investigation’), a sample of Chinese exporting producers was selected and individual duty rates ranging from 26,3 % to 36,5 % were imposed on the companies included in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample were attributed a duty rate of 30,6 %. A duty rate of 69,7 % was imposed on all other Chinese companies.
(2) Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 stipulates that where any new exporting producer in China provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that:
— it did not export to the Union the products described in Article 1(1) of that Regulation during the investigation period (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) (‘the investigation period’) (the first criterion),
— it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation (the second criterion), and
— it has actually exported to the Union the products concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Union (the third criterion),
B.   NEW EXPORTING PRODUCER REQUEST
(3) A Chinese company (‘the applicant’) has applied to be granted the same treatment as the companies cooperating in the original investigation not included in the sample (‘new exporting producer treatment’).
(4) An examination has been carried out to determine whether the applicant fulfils the criteria for being granted new exporting producer treatment as set out in Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011.
(5) A questionnaire was sent to the applicant who was asked to supply evidence to demonstrate that it met the three criteria mentioned above.
(6) The evidence provided by the Chinese exporting producer was considered sufficient to show that it fulfils the criteria set out in Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011. This exporting producer can therefore be granted the duty rate applicable to the cooperating companies not included in the sample (i.e. 30,6 %) and consequently its name can be added to the list of exporting producers in Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011.
(7) The applicant and the Union industry have been informed of the findings of the examination and were given the opportunity to submit their comments.
(8) All arguments and submissions made by interested parties were analysed and duly taken into account where warranted,","{'header': '29.6.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 169/11', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 567/2012\nof 26 June 2012\namending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of ceramic tiles originating in the People’s Republic of China, by adding a company to the list of producers from the People’s Republic of China listed in Annex I', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe following company shall be added to the list of producers from the People’s Republic of China listed in Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 917/2011:\n‘Name\nTARIC additional code\nOnna Ceramic Industries (China) Co.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2), and in particular Article 9 and Article 11(3) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In 1991, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91(3), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in, inter alia, the People's Republic of China.
(2) By Regulation (EC) No 192/1999(4) the Council, further to an investigation in accordance with Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation), extended the above anti-dumping measure to: (a) imports of gas-fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters consigned from or originating in Taiwan; and (b) imports of certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan.
(3) In 2001, Council Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001(5), imposed a definitive duty on gas fuelled non-refillable pocket flint lighters falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) originating in the People's Republic of China and maintained the anti-dumping duties extended by Regulation (EC) No 192/1999 to imports of certain refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan falling within CN code ex 9613 20 90 (TARIC codes 9613 20 90*21 and 9613 20 90*29 ) and to imports of non-refillable lighters consigned from Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ) or originating in Taiwan and falling within CN code 9613 10 00 (TARIC code 9613 10 00*19 ). These duties were imposed further to an expiry review concerning the definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 and extended by Regulation (EC) No 192/1999, in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.
(4) In 14 May 2002, the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters, whether flint or piezo, with or without a refill valve originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam (disposable lighters).
(5) The complaint was lodged by the European Federation of Lighter Manufacturers (EFLM) acting on behalf of Community producers representing 90 % of total Community production of disposable lighters pursuant to Articles 4(1) and 5(4) of the basic Regulation.
(6) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding in accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation.
(7) Regarding the definitive anti-dumping measures in force against non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan, the Commission considered that should it be determined that, on the basis of the findings of the investigation initiated in accordance with Article 5 of the basic Regulation, measures are to be imposed on disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, the continued imposition of the measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 would no longer be appropriate, and Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 would have to be amended or repealed accordingly. Indeed, should the investigation have been formally concluded, one of the consequences could have been the imposition of measures on all disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters, i.e. refillable or non-refillable, piezo or flint originating in the countries subject to the present investigation. On the other hand, measures on refillable or non-refillable flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China were already in place, which could have led to conflict with the new measures. Such conflict would have been avoided by amending or repealing the existing measures. Therefore, it was considered that a review in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation (interim review) should be opened as regards Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 in order to allow any amendment or repeal necessary in the light of the investigation under Article 5 of the basic Regulation concerning all disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.
(8) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(6), simultaneously initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam and an interim review with regard to Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001. Considering the above, the initiation of this interim review was entirely of an ancillary nature.
(9) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the representative users and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(10) By a letter of 14 July 2003 to the Commission, EFLM formally withdrew its complaint.
(11) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation, the proceeding may be terminated where the complaint is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(12) The Commission considered that the present proceeding should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment.
(13) One exporting producer from China claimed that the Commission should continue its investigation despite the withdrawal of the complaint and publish the relevant findings, in particular as regards dumping. In this context, the exporting producer concerned argued that he would have an interest in the continuation of the investigation due to his cooperation throughout the proceeding and his efforts to show the absence of dumping as far as his own exports are concerned.
(14) The same exporting producer further claimed that it should be avoided in future to initiate anti-dumping proceedings. He alleged that the withdrawal of the complaint would show that the complaint leading to this investigation was unfounded. Therefore, this exporting producer concluded that should there be a finding of absence of dumping, this should be published accordingly. This would prevent the Community industry to lodge a new complaint in the near future.
(15) These claims had to be rejected. In accordance with Article 5(1) of the basic Regulation, an anti-dumping investigation shall be initiated in each case the Commission has received a complaint containing merely sufficient prima facie evidence of the existence of injurious dumping. In the present case, it was found that the complaint lodged by the Community industry was sufficiently supported by prima facie evidence, consequently the initiation of the present proceeding was fully justified. In accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation an anti-dumping proceeding may be terminated in case the complaint is withdrawn unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. As mentioned above in recital 12, however, there was no evidence or information available that a termination of the proceeding would not be in the Community interest. When examining the Community interest, and in accordance with Article 21 of the basic Regulation, the interests of the exporting producers cannot be taken in consideration. In this context it should be noted that no comments were received from parties mentioned in Article 21 of the basic Regulation, such as users, importers or consumers indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest. Therefore, it was concluded that there was no reason to continue the investigation, and accordingly, the proceeding should be terminated without formal determinations concerning the existence or absence of dumping and injury nor any other aspect of the investigation.
(16) The same exporting producer claimed that the definitive anti-dumping measures in force against non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan should be repealed in case of the termination of the proceeding. In this context, the exporting producer concerned argued that the current investigation covers the same like product and that therefore the continuation of the definitive measures on non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan would be in breach of Article 1(4) and 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(17) It should be noted that no formal conclusions have been reached on any of the aspects investigated during the current proceeding, including the investigation regarding the product under consideration and the like product. The evidence which had been submitted within the complaint leading to the initiation of the present proceeding, including the information concerning the product under consideration and the like product was prima facie evidence, which was considered satisfying for the initiation stage, but cannot suffice for, nor predict, any final determination.
(18) Furthermore, as mentioned above in recitals 7 and 8, the interim review was merely ancillary to the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation and should allow to amend or repeal the anti-dumping duty in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan, if appropriate, on the basis of the findings of the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation. As mentioned above in recitals 15 and 17, the current investigation did not lead to any formal conclusions which would justify the amendment or repeal of Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 by which it was found that dumped imports of flint lighters from the People's Republic of China caused injury to the Community industry. In accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation, an anti-dumping duty shall be imposed when it was finally established that there is dumping and injury caused thereby, and that the Community interest calls for intervention. In accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, definitive anti-dumping measures can only be amended or repealed where circumstances with regard to dumping and injury have changed significantly, which could not be confirmed in the present proceeding. Consequently, the interim review should be terminated without amending or repealing the measures in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan.
(19) Given the above, the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of disposable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.
(20) The interim review should be terminated without amending or repealing the measures in force on imports of non-refillable flint lighters and certain refillable lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan given its ancillary nature described in recitals 7 and 8 to the investigation initiated pursuant to Article 5 of the basic Regulation,","{'title': ""2003/645/EC: Commission Decision of 11 September 2003 terminating the anti-dumping proceedings concerning imports of disposable gas-fuelled pocket lighters originating in the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam and terminating the interim review of the anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan and on imports of certain refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China or consigned from or originating in Taiwan""}"

This minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 2003/04 marketing year.
(3) The quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 39 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance. The balance indicates the need to import raw sugar and to open for the 2003/04 marketing year tariff quotas at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the above agreements so that the Community refineries' supply needs can be met for part of the year. In view of the forecasts for raw cane sugar production which are now available for the 2003/04 marketing year and as a result of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member State and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorise imports for each refining Member State for the period 1 July 2003 to 29 February 2004.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 83 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Application of the rules on competition in the maritime transport sector has been subject to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 (3) since 1987. Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 originally had two functions. Firstly, it contained procedural provisions for the enforcement of Community competition rules in the maritime transport sector. Secondly, it laid down certain specific substantive competition provisions for the maritime sector and notably a block exemption for liner shipping conferences, allowing them to fix prices and regulate capacity under certain conditions, the exclusion of purely technical agreements from the application of Article 81(1) of the Treaty and a procedure for dealing with conflicts of international law. It did not apply to maritime transport services between ports in one or to the same Member State (cabotage) and international tramp vessel services.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (4) amended Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 to bring maritime transport under the common competition enforcement rules applicable to all sectors with effect from 1 May 2004, with the exception of cabotage and international tramp vessel services. However, the specific substantive competition provisions relating to the maritime sector continue to fall within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86.
(3) The liner shipping conference block exemption provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 exempts from the prohibition of Article 81(1) of the Treaty agreements, decisions and concerted practices of all or part of the members of one or more liner conferences which fulfil certain conditions. The justification for the block exemption in essence assumes that conferences bring stability, ensuring exporters reliable services which cannot be achieved by less restrictive means. However, a thorough review of the industry carried out by the Commission has demonstrated that liner shipping is not unique as its cost structure does not differ substantially from that of other industries. There is therefore no evidence that the industry needs to be protected from competition.
(4) The first condition for exemption under Article 81(3) requires that the restrictive agreement contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress. As regards the efficiencies generated by conferences, liner conferences are no longer able to enforce the conference tariff although they still manage to set charges and surcharges which are a part of the price of transport. There is also no evidence that the conference system leads to more stable freight rates or more reliable shipping services than would be the case in a fully competitive market. Conference members increasingly offer their services via individual service agreements entered into with individual exporters. In addition, conferences do not manage the carrying capacity that is available as this is an individual decision taken by each carrier. Under current market conditions price stability and the reliability of services are brought about by individual service agreements. The alleged causal link between the restrictions (price fixing and supply regulation) and the claimed efficiencies (reliable services) therefore appears too tenuous to meet the first condition of Article 81(3).
(5) The second condition for exemption under Article 81(3) is that consumers must be compensated for the negative effects resulting from the restriction of competition. In the case of hard core restrictions, such as horizontal price fixing which occur when the conference tariff is set and charges and surcharges are jointly fixed, the negative effects are very serious. However no clearly positive effects have been identified. Transport users consider that conferences operate for the benefit of the least efficient members and call for their abolishment. Conferences no longer fulfil the second condition of Article 81(3).
(6) The third condition for exemption under Article 81(3) is that the conduct must not impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of its objectives. Consortia are cooperative agreements between liner shipping lines that do not involve price fixing and are therefore less restrictive than conferences. Transport users consider them to provide adequate, reliable and efficient scheduled maritime services. In addition the use of individual service agreements has increased significantly in recent years. By definition, such individual service agreements do not restrict competition and provide benefits to exporters as they make it possible to tailor special services. Furthermore, because the price is established in advance and does not fluctuate for a predetermined period (usually up to one year), service contracts can contribute to price stability. It has therefore not been established that the restrictions of competition permitted under Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 (price fixing and capacity regulation) are indispensable for the provision of reliable shipping services to transport users as these can be achieved by less restrictive means. The third condition under Article 81(3) is therefore not satisfied.
(7) Finally, the fourth condition under Article 81(3) requires that the conference should remain subject to effective competitive constraints. In current market circumstances conferences are present in nearly all major trade lanes and they compete with carriers grouped in consortia and with independent lines. Whilst there may be price competition on the ocean freight rate due to the weakening of the conference system there is hardly any price competition with respect to the surcharges and ancillary charges. These are set by the conference and the same level of charges is often applied by non-conference carriers. In addition, carriers participate in conferences and consortia on the same trade, exchanging commercially sensitive information and cumulating the benefits of the conference (price fixing and capacity regulation) and of the consortia (operational cooperation for the provision of a joint service) block exemptions. Given the increasing number of links between carriers in the same trade, determining the extent to which conferences are subject to effective internal and external competition is a very complex exercise and one that can only be done on a case by case basis.
(8) Liner shipping conferences therefore no longer fulfil the four cumulative conditions for exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty and the block exemption in respect of such conferences should therefore be abolished.
(9) The exclusion from the prohibition of Article 81(1) of the Treaty of purely technical agreements and the procedure for dealing with conflicts of law which may arise are also redundant. Those provisions should therefore also be deleted.
(10) In the light of the above, Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 should be repealed in its entirety.
(11) Liner conferences are tolerated in several jurisdictions. In this, as in other sectors, competition law is not applied in the same way worldwide. In light of the global nature of the liner shipping industry, the Commission should take the appropriate steps to advance the removal of the price fixing exemption for liner conferences that exist elsewhere whilst maintaining the exemption for operational cooperation between shipping lines grouped in consortia and alliances, in line with the recommendations of the OECD Secretariat in 2002.
(12) Cabotage and international tramp vessel services have been excluded from the rules implementing Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty originally laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 and subsequently in Regulation (EC) No 1/2003. They are currently the only remaining sectors to be excluded from the Community competition implementing rules. The lack of effective enforcement powers for these sectors is an anomaly from a regulatory point of view.
(13) The exclusion of tramp vessel services from Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 was based on the fact that rates for these services are freely negotiated on a case by case basis in accordance with supply and demand conditions. However, such market conditions are present in other sectors and the substantive provisions of Articles 81 and 82 already apply to these services. No convincing reason has been brought forward to maintain the current exclusion of these services from the rules implementing Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. Similarly, although cabotage services often have no effect on intra Community trade, this does not mean that they should be excluded from the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 from the outset.
(14) As the mechanisms enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 are appropriate for applying the competition rules to all sectors, the scope of that Regulation should be amended so as to include cabotage and tramp vessel services.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(16) Since Member States may need to adjust their international commitments in the light of the abolition of the conference system, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 relating to the liner conference block exemption should continue to apply to conferences satisfying the requirements of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 on the date of entry into force of this Regulation for a transitional period,","{'header': '28.9.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 269/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1419/2006\nof 25 September 2006\nrepealing Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 laying down detailed rules for the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty to maritime transport, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 as regards the extension of its scope to include cabotage and international tramp services\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Application of the rules on competition in the maritime transport sector has been subject to the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86(3)since 1987. Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 originally had two functions. Firstly, it contained procedural provisions for the enforcement of Community competition rules in the maritime transport sector. Secondly, it laid down certain specific substantive competition provisions for the maritime sector and notably a block exemption for liner shipping conferences, allowing them to fix prices and regulate capacity under certain conditions, the exclusion of purely technical agreements from the application of Article 81(1) of the Treaty and a procedure for dealing with conflicts of international law. It did not apply to maritime transport services between ports in one or to the same Member State (cabotage) and international tramp vessel services.\n\n((2)) Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty(4)amended Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 to bring maritime transport under the common competition enforcement rules applicable to all sectors with effect from 1 May 2004, with the exception of cabotage and international tramp vessel services. However, the specific substantive competition provisions relating to the maritime sector continue to fall within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86.\n\n((3)) The liner shipping conference block exemption provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 exempts from the prohibition of Article 81(1) of the Treaty agreements, decisions and concerted practices of all or part of the members of one or more liner conferences which fulfil certain conditions. The justification for the block exemption in essence assumes that conferences bring stability, ensuring exporters reliable services which cannot be achieved by less restrictive means. However, a thorough review of the industry carried out by the Commission has demonstrated that liner shipping is not unique as its cost structure does not differ substantially from that of other industries. There is therefore no evidence that the industry needs to be protected from competition.\n\n((4)) The first condition for exemption under Article 81(3) requires that the restrictive agreement contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or to promoting technical or economic progress. As regards the efficiencies generated by conferences, liner conferences are no longer able to enforce the conference tariff although they still manage to set charges and surcharges which are a part of the price of transport. There is also no evidence that the conference system leads to more stable freight rates or more reliable shipping services than would be the case in a fully competitive market. Conference members increasingly offer their services via individual service agreements entered into with individual exporters. In addition, conferences do not manage the carrying capacity that is available as this is an individual decision taken by each carrier. Under current market conditions price stability and the reliability of services are brought about by individual service agreements. The alleged causal link between the restrictions (price fixing and supply regulation) and the claimed efficiencies (reliable services) therefore appears too tenuous to meet the first condition of Article 81(3).\n\n((5)) The second condition for exemption under Article 81(3) is that consumers must be compensated for the negative effects resulting from the restriction of competition. In the case of hard core restrictions, such as horizontal price fixing which occur when the conference tariff is set and charges and surcharges are jointly fixed, the negative effects are very serious. However no clearly positive effects have been identified. Transport users consider that conferences operate for the benefit of the least efficient members and call for their abolishment. Conferences no longer fulfil the second condition of Article 81(3).\n\n((6)) The third condition for exemption under Article 81(3) is that the conduct must not impose on the undertakings concerned restrictions which are not indispensable to the attainment of its objectives. Consortia are cooperative agreements between liner shipping lines that do not involve price fixing and are therefore less restrictive than conferences. Transport users consider them to provide adequate, reliable and efficient scheduled maritime services. In addition the use of individual service agreements has increased significantly in recent years. By definition, such individual service agreements do not restrict competition and provide benefits to exporters as they make it possible to tailor special services. Furthermore, because the price is established in advance and does not fluctuate for a predetermined period (usually up to one year), service contracts can contribute to price stability. It has therefore not been established that the restrictions of competition permitted under Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 (price fixing and capacity regulation) are indispensable for the provision of reliable shipping services to transport users as these can be achieved by less restrictive means. The third condition under Article 81(3) is therefore not satisfied.\n\n((7)) Finally, the fourth condition under Article 81(3) requires that the conference should remain subject to effective competitive constraints. In current market circumstances conferences are present in nearly all major trade lanes and they compete with carriers grouped in consortia and with independent lines. Whilst there may be price competition on the ocean freight rate due to the weakening of the conference system there is hardly any price competition with respect to the surcharges and ancillary charges. These are set by the conference and the same level of charges is often applied by non-conference carriers. In addition, carriers participate in conferences and consortia on the same trade, exchanging commercially sensitive information and cumulating the benefits of the conference (price fixing and capacity regulation) and of the consortia (operational cooperation for the provision of a joint service) block exemptions. Given the increasing number of links between carriers in the same trade, determining the extent to which conferences are subject to effective internal and external competition is a very complex exercise and one that can only be done on a case by case basis.\n\n((8)) Liner shipping conferences therefore no longer fulfil the four cumulative conditions for exemption under Article 81(3) of the Treaty and the block exemption in respect of such conferences should therefore be abolished.\n\n((9)) The exclusion from the prohibition of Article 81(1) of the Treaty of purely technical agreements and the procedure for dealing with conflicts of law which may arise are also redundant. Those provisions should therefore also be deleted.\n\n((10)) In the light of the above, Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 should be repealed in its entirety.\n\n((11)) Liner conferences are tolerated in several jurisdictions. In this, as in other sectors, competition law is not applied in the same way worldwide. In light of the global nature of the liner shipping industry, the Commission should take the appropriate steps to advance the removal of the price fixing exemption for liner conferences that exist elsewhere whilst maintaining the exemption for operational cooperation between shipping lines grouped in consortia and alliances, in line with the recommendations of the OECD Secretariat in 2002.\n\n((12)) Cabotage and international tramp vessel services have been excluded from the rules implementing Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty originally laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 4056/86 and subsequently in Regulation (EC) No 1/2003.

However, such market conditions are present in other sectors and the substantive provisions of Articles 81 and 82 already apply to these services.

(1) In order to combat illegal immigration effectively and to improve border control, it is essential that all Member States introduce provisions laying down obligations on air carriers transporting passengers into the territory of the Member States. In addition, in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, the financial penalties currently provided for by the Member States for cases where carriers fail to meet their obligations should be harmonised to the extent possible, taking into account the differences in legal systems and practices between the Member States.
(2) The European Council of 25 and 26 March 2004 adopted a Declaration on combating terrorism stressing the need to expedite examination of measures in this area and take work forward on the proposed Council Directive on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data with a view to an early conclusion on this measure.
(3) It is important to avoid a vacuum in the Community's action in combating illegal immigration.
(4) As from 1 May 2004 the Council can no longer act on an initiative of a Member State.
(5) The Council has exhausted all possibilities to obtain in time the opinion of the European Parliament.
(6) Under these exceptional circumstances the Directive should be adopted without the opinion of the European Parliament.
(7) The obligations to be imposed on carriers by virtue of this Directive are complementary to those established pursuant to the provisions of Article 26 of the 1990 Schengen Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985, as supplemented by Council Directive 2001/51/EC (2), the two types of obligation serving the same objective of curbing migratory flows and combating illegal immigration.
(8) Without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3), the freedom of the Member States to retain or introduce additional obligations for aircarriers or some categories of other carriers, including information or data in relation to return tickets, whether referred to in this Directive or not, should not be affected.
(9) In order to combat illegal immigration more effectively and in order to ensure the greater effectiveness of this objective, it is essential that, without prejudice to the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC, account be taken at the earliest opportunity of any technological innovation, especially with reference to the integration and use of biometric features in the information to be provided by the carriers.
(10) Member States should ensure that in any proceedings brought against carriers which may result in the application of penalties, the rights of defence and the right of appeal against such decisions can be exercised effectively.
(11) These measures take up the control options set out in the Decision of the Executive Committee of Schengen (SCH/Com-ex (94) 17-rev. 4), aimed at enabling border checks to be increased and providing for sufficient time to enable detailed and comprehensive checks to be carried out on all passengers through the transmission of passenger data to the authorities responsible for carrying out such controls.
(12) Directive 95/46/EC applies with regard to the processing of personal data by the authorities of the Member States. This means, that whereas it would be legitimate to process the passenger data transmitted for the performance of border checks also for the purposes of allowing their use as evidence in proceedings aiming at the enforcement of the laws and regulations on entry and immigration, including their provisions on the protection of public policy (ordre public) and national security, any further processing in a way incompatible with those purposes would run counter to the principle set out in Article 6(1)(b) of Directive 95/46/EC. Member States should provide for a system of sanctions to be applied in the event of use contrary to the purpose of the present Directive.
(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Directive, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Directive builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Directive whether it will implement it in its national law.
(14) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Directive constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (4), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point E, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (5).
(15) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis

(16) Ireland is taking part in this Directive in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis

DIRECTIVE 2007/38/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 11 July 2007
on the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 71(1)(c) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) A number of accidents are caused by drivers of heavy goods vehicles who are not aware that other road users are very close to or beside their vehicle. These accidents are often related to a change of direction at crossings, junctions or roundabouts when drivers fail to detect other road users in the blind spots which exist in the area immediately around their vehicles. It is estimated that every year about 400 people in Europe are killed in such circumstances, most of them being vulnerable road users such as cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians.
(2) In its White Paper of 12 September 2001‘European transport policy for 2010: time to decide’ the Commission set the target of halving the number of road fatalities in the EU by 2010. In its third Road Safety Action Programme the Commission committed itself to investigating the issue of retrofitting heavy goods vehicles already in circulation with devices for indirect vision in order to reduce their blind spots and thus to contribute to the reduction of road fatalities.
(3) In its 10 year roadmap in the Final Report ‘A Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century’, the CARS 21 High Level Group recommended an integrated approach with regard to road safety including the compulsory introduction of new safety features, such as mirrors to reduce the blind spots of heavy goods vehicles.
(4) Devices of indirect vision, such as wide-angle and close-proximity mirrors, cameras, monitors, or other type-approved systems of indirect vision, improve the driver's field of vision and increase vehicle safety.
(5) Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices (3), whilst having great potential for reducing the number of casualties affects only newly registered vehicles.
(6) Vehicles which are already in circulation are therefore not subject to the obligations set out in Directive 2003/97/EC. It can be estimated that those vehicles will not be fully replaced until 2023.
(7) In order to help reduce fatal and severe accidents caused by those vehicles and involving vulnerable road users, it is appropriate, in the meantime, to provide that the vehicles concerned be retrofitted with improved devices for indirect vision.
(8) Vehicles already in circulation should be equipped with mirrors reducing the lateral blind spots whilst fulfilling the technical requirements of Directive 2003/97/EC. That is technically feasible for the majority of the vehicles concerned.
(9) It is, however, appropriate and proportionate to provide exemptions and derogations for vehicles whose remaining lifespan is short, vehicles which are equipped with lateral mirrors whose field of vision covers only marginally less than the fields of vision laid down in Directive 2003/97/EC, and vehicles where fitting with mirrors complying with that Directive is not economically viable.
(10) Vehicles in categories N2 and N3 which were originally registered and/or type-approved and/or put into service before 1 January 2000 and which are operated mainly for their historical interest should not be affected by the rules and procedures laid down in this Directive.
(11) For heavy goods vehicles which, for technical and/or economic reasons, cannot be made to fully comply with the requirements of this Directive, the competent authorities should allow for and approve alternative solutions. In such cases, Member States should communicate lists of permitted and approved technical solutions to the Commission, which should in turn make them available to all Member States.
(12) So that the market can cope with a high demand for mirrors within a short period of time, a transitional period should be provided for.
(13) Heavy goods vehicles retrofitted before the dates for transposition of Directive 2003/97/EC with devices of indirect vision which largely cover the field of vision required by that Directive should be exempted from the requirements of this Directive.
(14) The retrofitting exercise should be accompanied by appropriate measures designed to raise awareness of the dangers linked to the existence of blind spots of heavy goods vehicles, including information efforts directed towards vulnerable road users and in relation to the correct adjustment and use of indirect vision devices.
(15) Vehicles other than those covered by this Directive, such as light goods vehicles and buses, which are not equipped with improved devices for indirect vision are also involved in blind spot accidents. Therefore, Community legislation on active and passive safety requirements should be continually reviewed with a view to improving and promoting road safety.
(16) In the interests of a more comprehensive analysis and a future strategy on reducing blind spot accidents, the Commission should, pursuant to Council Decision 93/704/EC of 30 November 1993 on the creation of a Community database on road accidents (4) and other relevant Community acts, such as Decision No 2367/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Community statistical programme 2003 to 2007 (5), gather relevant data from the Member States and process it appropriately.
(17) Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers (6) provides for periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum permissible mass exceeding 3,5 tons, at least on a yearly basis. Heavy goods vehicles should, among others things, be fitted with rear-view mirrors complying with the requirements of this Directive in order to pass this roadworthiness test. Roadworthiness certificates issued by the Member States for vehicles registered on their territory are mutually recognised for the purpose of the free circulation of vehicles on Member State roads.
(18) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the retrofitting of vehicles already in circulation in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
(19) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (7), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,","{'header': '14.7.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 184/25', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2007/38/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 July 2007\non the retrofitting of mirrors to heavy goods vehicles registered in the Community', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) A number of accidents are caused by drivers of heavy goods vehicles who are not aware that other road users are very close to or beside their vehicle. These accidents are often related to a change of direction at crossings, junctions or roundabouts when drivers fail to detect other road users in the blind spots which exist in the area immediately around their vehicles. It is estimated that every year about 400 people in Europe are killed in such circumstances, most of them being vulnerable road users such as cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians.\n\n((2)) In its White Paper of 12 September 2001‘European transport policy for 2010: time to decide’ the Commission set the target of halving the number of road fatalities in the EU by 2010. In its third Road Safety Action Programme the Commission committed itself to investigating the issue of retrofitting heavy goods vehicles already in circulation with devices for indirect vision in order to reduce their blind spots and thus to contribute to the reduction of road fatalities.\n\n((3)) In its 10 year roadmap in the Final Report ‘A Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century’, the CARS 21 High Level Group recommended an integrated approach with regard to road safety including the compulsory introduction of new safety features, such as mirrors to reduce the blind spots of heavy goods vehicles.\n\n((4)) Devices of indirect vision, such as wide-angle and close-proximity mirrors, cameras, monitors, or other type-approved systems of indirect vision, improve the driver's field of vision and increase vehicle safety.\n\n((5)) Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices(3), whilst having great potential for reducing the number of casualties affects only newly registered vehicles.\n\n((6)) Vehicles which are already in circulation are therefore not subject to the obligations set out in Directive 2003/97/EC. It can be estimated that those vehicles will not be fully replaced until 2023.\n\n((7)) In order to help reduce fatal and severe accidents caused by those vehicles and involving vulnerable road users, it is appropriate, in the meantime, to provide that the vehicles concerned be retrofitted with improved devices for indirect vision.\n\n((8)) Vehicles already in circulation should be equipped with mirrors reducing the lateral blind spots whilst fulfilling the technical requirements of Directive 2003/97/EC. That is technically feasible for the majority of the vehicles concerned.\n\n((9)) It is, however, appropriate and proportionate to provide exemptions and derogations for vehicles whose remaining lifespan is short, vehicles which are equipped with lateral mirrors whose field of vision covers only marginally less than the fields of vision laid down in Directive 2003/97/EC, and vehicles where fitting with mirrors complying with that Directive is not economically viable.\n\n((10)) Vehicles in categories N2and N3which were originally registered and/or type-approved and/or put into service before 1 January 2000 and which are operated mainly for their historical interest should not be affected by the rules and procedures laid down in this Directive.\n\n((11)) For heavy goods vehicles which, for technical and/or economic reasons, cannot be made to fully comply with the requirements of this Directive, the competent authorities should allow for and approve alternative solutions. In such cases, Member States should communicate lists of permitted and approved technical solutions to the Commission, which should in turn make them available to all Member States.\n\n((12)) So that the market can cope with a high demand for mirrors within a short period of time, a transitional period should be provided for.\n\n((13)) Heavy goods vehicles retrofitted before the dates for transposition of Directive 2003/97/EC with devices of indirect vision which largely cover the field of vision required by that Directive should be exempted from the requirements of this Directive.\n\n((14)) The retrofitting exercise should be accompanied by appropriate measures designed to raise awareness of the dangers linked to the existence of blind spots of heavy goods vehicles, including information efforts directed towards vulnerable road users and in relation to the correct adjustment and use of indirect vision devices.\n\n((15)) Vehicles other than those covered by this Directive, such as light goods vehicles and buses, which are not equipped with improved devices for indirect vision are also involved in blind spot accidents. Therefore, Community legislation on active and passive safety requirements should be continually reviewed with a view to improving and promoting road safety.\n\n((16)) In the interests of a more comprehensive analysis and a future strategy on reducing blind spot accidents, the Commission should, pursuant to Council Decision 93/704/EC of 30 November 1993 on the creation of a Community database on road accidents(4)and other relevant Community acts, such as Decision No 2367/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Community statistical programme 2003 to 2007(5), gather relevant data from the Member States and process it appropriately.\n\n((17)) Council Directive 96/96/EC of 20 December 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers(6)provides for periodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum permissible mass exceeding 3,5\xa0tons, at least on a yearly basis. Heavy goods vehicles should, among others things, be fitted with rear-view mirrors complying with the requirements of this Directive in order to pass this roadworthiness test. Roadworthiness certificates issued by the Member States for vehicles registered on their territory are mutually recognised for the purpose of the free circulation of vehicles on Member State roads.\n\n((18)) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the retrofitting of vehicles already in circulation in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.\n\n((19)) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making(7), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interest of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThis Directive lays down requirements for the fitting with systems of indirect vision of vehicles of categories N\n2\nand N\n3\nas referred to in point 2 of Annex II, Section A to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers\n(\n8\n)\nwhich are registered in the Community.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Directive shall apply to vehicles of categories N\n2\nand N\n3\nwhich are not type-approved or approved as a single vehicle under Directive 2003/97/EC.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Directive shall not apply to any of the following:\n(a)\nVehicles of categories N\n2\nand N\n3\nregistered before 1 January 2000;\n(b)\nVehicles of category N\n2\nhaving a maximum total permissible mass not exceeding 7,5\xa0tons, where it is impossible to mount a class V mirror in a way that ensures that the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(i)\nno part of the mirror is less than 2\xa0m (a tolerance of\xa0+\xa010\xa0cm may be applied) from the ground, regardless of the adjustment position, when the vehicle is under a load corresponding to its maximum technically permissible weight; and\n(ii)\nthe mirror is fully visible from the driving position;\n(c)\nVehicles of categories N\n2\nand N\n3\nthat are subject to national measures which entered into force before the dates for transposition of Directive 2003/97/EC and which require fitment, on the passenger side, of other means of indirect vision covering not less than 95\xa0% of the total field of vision at ground level of class IV and class V mirrors under that Directive.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0With effect from 6 August 2007, and not later than 31 March 2009, Member States shall require that all vehicles referred to in Article 2(1) be equipped, on the passenger side, with wide-angle and close-proximity mirrors which fulfil the requirements for class IV and class V mirrors under Directive 2003/97/EC respectively.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from paragraph 1, compliance with the requirements of this Directive shall be deemed to be achieved where vehicles are equipped, on the passenger side, with wide-angle and close-proximity mirrors, whose combination of fields of vision covers not less than 95\xa0% of the field of vision at ground level of a class IV mirror and not less than 85\xa0% of the field of vision at ground level of a class V mirror under Directive 2003/97/EC.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Vehicles referred to in Article 2 which, for want of available, economically viable, technical solutions, cannot be equipped with mirrors complying with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 or 2 of this Article, may be equipped with supplementary mirrors and/or other devices of indirect vision, provided that the combination of such devices covers not less than 95\xa0% of the field of vision at ground level of a class IV mirror and not less than 85\xa0% of the field of vision at ground level of a class V mirror under Directive 2003/97/EC.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall communicate a list of technical solutions complying with this Article to the Commission.

","4.8.2009 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 202/44
COUNCIL DECISION
of 7 July 2009
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Lithuania
(2009/588/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Lithuania,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1), which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in Lithuania. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Lithuania on 24 June 2009 (3).
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Lithuania, this overall assessment leads to the conclusion set out in this Decision.
(7) According to EDP notification by the Lithuanian authorities, the general government deficit in Lithuania reached 3,2 % of GDP in 2008, thus exceeding the 3,0 % of GDP reference value. The deficit was close to the 3,0 % of GDP reference value but the excess over the reference value cannot be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it did not result from a severe economic downturn in 2008, when GDP growth declined to 3,0 % in 2008 from 8,9 % in 2007. This annual average growth figure alone does not allow the 2008 deficit to be qualified as exceptional. Furthermore, the excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission services’ spring 2009 forecast, taking into account measures for the current year in the budget for 2009 and in the supplementary budget adopted by Parliament in May 2009, the deficit would widen to 5,4 % of GDP in 2009, and on a no-policy-change assumption, to worsen further to 8,0 % of GDP in 2010. Therefore, the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) General government gross debt remains well below the 60 % of GDP reference value and stood at 15,6 % of GDP in 2008. It is, nevertheless, according to the Commission services’ spring 2009 forecast, projected to rise rapidly to 22,6 % of GDP in 2009 and to 31,9 % in 2010 mainly due to expected high primary deficits.
(9) In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully funded pillar. While the implementation of these reforms leads to a temporary deterioration of the budgetary position, the long-term sustainability of public finances clearly improves. Based on the estimates of the Lithuanian authorities, the net costs of this reform amount to 1,0 % of GDP in 2008, and due to the temporary reduction of contributions from 5,5 % to 2,0 %, 0,5 % in 2009 and 0,4 % in 2010. According to the Stability and Growth Pact, these can be taken into account on a linear degressive basis for a transitory period and only where the deficit remains close to the reference value. For 2008, which is the only year in which the deficit can be considered close to the reference value, taking into account the net cost of the reform would produce an adjusted deficit of 2,6 % of GDP. For 2009 and 2010, on the other hand, the deficit forecast by the Commission services is no longer close to the reference value and, therefore, the cost of the pension reform cannot be taken into account.
(10) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Lithuania, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '4.8.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 202/44', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 July 2009\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Lithuania\n(2009/588/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1), which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

This annual average growth figure alone does not allow the 2008 deficit to be qualified as exceptional. Furthermore, the excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission services’ spring 2009 forecast, taking into account measures for the current year in the budget for 2009 and in the supplementary budget adopted by Parliament in May 2009, the deficit would widen to 5,4\xa0% of GDP in 2009, and on a no-policy-change assumption, to worsen further to 8,0\xa0% of GDP in 2010. Therefore, the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.\n\n((8)) General government gross debt remains well below the 60\xa0% of GDP reference value and stood at 15,6\xa0% of GDP in 2008. It is, nevertheless, according to the Commission services’ spring 2009 forecast, projected to rise rapidly to 22,6\xa0% of GDP in 2009 and to 31,9\xa0% in 2010 mainly due to expected high primary deficits.\n\n((9)) In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully funded pillar. While the implementation of these reforms leads to a temporary deterioration of the budgetary position, the long-term sustainability of public finances clearly improves. Based on the estimates of the Lithuanian authorities, the net costs of this reform amount to 1,0\xa0% of GDP in 2008, and due to the temporary reduction of contributions from 5,5\xa0% to 2,0\xa0%, 0,5\xa0% in 2009 and 0,4\xa0% in 2010. According to the Stability and Growth Pact, these can be taken into account on a linear degressive basis for a transitory period and only where the deficit remains close to the reference value. For 2008, which is the only year in which the deficit can be considered close to the reference value, taking into account the net cost of the reform would produce an adjusted deficit of 2,6\xa0% of GDP. For 2009 and 2010, on the other hand, the deficit forecast by the Commission services is no longer close to the reference value and, therefore, the cost of the pension reform cannot be taken into account.\n\n((10)) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Lithuania, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFrom an overall assessment, it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Lithuania.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Lithuania.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the necessary measures must be adopted where it is evident that food imported from a third country is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and that such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.
(2) A Community inspection carried out in Gabon in 2007 has revealed serious deficiencies with regard to certain fishery products intended to be exported to the European Community. Serious shortcomings were identified, in particular, regarding the capacity of the Gabonese authorities to take corrective action when high levels of heavy metals and sulphites occur.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 of 19 December 2006 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (2) lays down maximum levels of heavy metals for certain fishery products.
(4) European Parliament and Council Directive 95/2/EC of 20 February 1995 on food additives others than colours and sweeteners (3) lays down maximum levels of sulphites in certain fishery products.
(5) Member States should therefore carry out appropriate checks on certain fishery products from Gabon on arrival at the Community border to ensure compliance with Regulation (EC) No 1881/2006 and Directive 95/2/EC as regards heavy metals and sulphites, respectively.
(6) Member States shall use appropriate sampling plans and analytical methods for these checks. For sampling and analysis of heavy metals Commission Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 (4) shall apply.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 sets up the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, which should be used to implement the mutual information requirement provided for in Article 22(2) of Council Directive 97/78/EC (5). In addition the Member States will keep the Commission informed through periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of those fishery products from Gabon, covered by this Regulation.

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 (3) provides, inter alia, for the co-financing of studies related to projects of common interest for an amount which may normally not exceed 50 % of the total cost, while the maximum contribution to projects in the area of telecommunications may not exceed 10 % of the total investment cost.
(2) Decision No 1336/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1997 on a series of guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks (4) identifies projects of common interest. Experience in implementing that Decision has shown that less than one project in twenty involves the deployment of a service, the remainder being deployment-related studies. As a result, the direct impact of aid granted for trans-European telecommunications networks is limited.
(3) The cost of deploying a trans-European service based on electronic data communications networks is significantly greater than the cost of a comparable service in a single Member State because of barriers of language, culture, legislation and administration.
(4) The cost of a preparatory study for a service in the telecommunications sector has been found to be a high proportion of the total investment required to deploy the service, and as a result the maximum contribution allowable under Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 is applied to such studies, precluding the grant of aid to the deployment of services. Consequently, grant of aid under that Regulation has had little direct effect in stimulating the deployment of services.
(5) Community aid should be granted in preference to projects which aim to stimulate the deployment of services and thus make the greatest contribution to the development of the information society. It is necessary therefore to increase the maximum contribution in proportion to the actual costs arising from the trans-European nature of a service.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included fenbutatin oxide.
(2) In accordance with Article 11e of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (4) was adopted on the non-inclusion of fenbutatin oxide.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(4) The application was submitted to Belgium, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) Belgium evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 1 December 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on fenbutatin oxide to the Commission on 23 August 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 January 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for fenbutatin oxide.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing fenbutatin oxide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include fenbutatin oxide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information confirming the results of the risk assessment, on the basis of most recent scientific knowledge; as regards the relevant impurity bis[hydroxybis(2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl)tin]oxide (SD 31723). That information should concern the following points: genotoxicological potential, ecotoxicological relevance, as well as spectra, storage stability of the impurity and methods of analysis in plant protection products.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(9) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing fenbutatin oxide to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (7) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(11) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(12) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of fenbutatin oxide and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning fenbutatin oxide in the Annex to that Decision.

The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 January 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for fenbutatin oxide.\n\n((6)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing fenbutatin oxide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include fenbutatin oxide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n\n((7)) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information confirming the results of the risk assessment, on the basis of most recent scientific knowledge; as regards the relevant impurity bis[hydroxybis(2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl)tin]oxide (SD 31723). That information should concern the following points: genotoxicological potential, ecotoxicological relevance, as well as spectra, storage stability of the impurity and methods of analysis in plant protection products.\n\n((8)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n\n((9)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing fenbutatin oxide to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((10)) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n\n((11)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n\n((12)) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of fenbutatin oxide and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning fenbutatin oxide in the Annex to that Decision.\n\n((13)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.\n\n((14)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe line concerning fenbutatin oxide in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC is deleted.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nMember States shall adopt and publish by 30 November 2011 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 of 22 May 2006 establishing Community financial measures for the implementation of the common fisheries policy and in the area of the Law of the Sea (1), and in particular Article 21 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Based upon the requests for Union co-financing that have been submitted by Member States in their fisheries control programmes for 2012, the Commission has adopted Implementing Decision 2012/294/EU of 25 May 2012 on a Union financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control, inspection and surveillance programmes for 2012 (2), which has left some of the 2012 budget available unused.
(2) That unused part of the 2012 budget should now be allocated by a new Decision.
(3) In conformity with Article 21(2) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, Member States have been asked to submit programmes related to additional funding in the priority areas defined by the Commission in its letter to Member States of 25 April 2012, i.e. projects aiming at improvements in the control system of a Member State as jointly identified by the Member State and the Commission, measurement of engine power, and traceability of fishery products. Requirements to be met by operators and/or Member States carrying out investments in traceability projects were defined by the Commission in its letter of 14 May 2012.
(4) On that basis and given budgetary constraints, requests in the programmes for Union funding related to actions such as pilot projects, the construction or modernisation of patrol vessels and aircrafts, and those training projects having no link with improvements to be brought in the control systems of Member States have been rejected since they were not dedicated to the priority areas defined above. Within the priority areas indicated by the Commission, not all the projects in the programmes could be retained, due to budgetary restraints. The Commission had to select the projects to be co-financed on the basis of the improvements to be brought in the control systems of Member States and of the requirements defined by the Commission for traceability. Applications concerning actions listed in Article 8(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 may qualify for Union funding.
(5) As to traceability projects, it is important to ensure that they are developed on the basis of internationally recognised standards, as required by Article 67(8) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 (3).
(6) The applications for Union funding have been assessed with regard to their compliance with the rules set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 391/2007 of 11 April 2007 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 as regards the expenditure incurred by Member States in implementing the monitoring and control systems applicable to the Common Fisheries Policy (4).
(7) The Commission has assessed the projects whose cost does not exceed EUR 40 000 VAT excluded, and has retained those for which it is justified to provide for Union co-financing in the light of the improvements they are likely to bring to the control system of the applicant Member States.
(8) It is appropriate to fix the maximum amounts and the rate of the Union financial contribution within the limits set by Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006 and to lay down the conditions under which such contribution may be granted.
(9) In order to encourage investment in the priority actions defined by the Commission and in view of the negative impact of the financial crisis on Member States’ budgets, expenditure related to the abovementioned priority areas should benefit from a high co-financing rate, within the limits laid down in Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006.
(10) In order to qualify for the contribution, projects co-financed on the basis of this Regulation should comply with all the relevant provision of Union legislation and, in particular with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,","{'header': '22.12.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 356/78', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 7 December 2012\non an additional financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control, inspection and surveillance programmes for 2012\n(notified under document C(2012) 8967)\n(Only the Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish texts are authentic)\n(2012/830/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Based upon the requests for Union co-financing that have been submitted by Member States in their fisheries control programmes for 2012, the Commission has adopted Implementing Decision 2012/294/EU of 25 May 2012 on a Union financial contribution towards Member States’ fisheries control, inspection and surveillance programmes for 2012(2), which has left some of the 2012 budget available unused.\n\n((2)) That unused part of the 2012 budget should now be allocated by a new Decision.\n\n((3)) In conformity with Article 21(2) of Regulation (EC) No 861/2006, Member States have been asked to submit programmes related to additional funding in the priority areas defined by the Commission in its letter to Member States of 25 April 2012, i.e. projects aiming at improvements in the control system of a Member State as jointly identified by the Member State and the Commission, measurement of engine power, and traceability of fishery products.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2000(2), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Following the confirmation of cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Ireland on 20 February, 13 March and 21 March 2001 respectively, certain protective measures were introduced pursuant to Commission Decision 2001/145/EC(3), which was replaced by Decision 2001/172/EC(4), as amended in turn by Decision 2001/190/EC(5) (United Kingdom); Commission Decision 2001/208/EC(6) (France); Commission Decision 2001/223/EC(7) (the Netherlands); and Commission Decision 2001/234/EC(8) (Ireland).
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 90/2001(10), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000(11), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(12), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds and, in particular, Articles 1, 5 to 15 and Annex F on refund certificates.
(4) The economic interests of exporters have been prejudiced by the procedures for issuing health certificates adopted by certain Member States in implementation of the protective measures provided for by the relevant Decisions, and by certain measures taken by some third countries which have resulted in import restrictions. The situation thus created has affected export opportunities under the conditions laid down by Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000.
(5) It is therefore necessary to limit these harmful effects by adopting special measures and extending certain time limits laid down in Regulations (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1520/2000 in respect of export procedures which could not be completed because of the aforementioned circumstances. In particular, the time limit provided for by Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should be extended to enable operators who have already completed the relevant customs export formalities or placed the goods in question under customs control to benefit from the extension of the validity of certificates.
(6) The benefit of these derogations should be reserved for operators who can prove, in particular on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(13), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(14), that they were prevented from carrying out export operations within the specified period by the aformentioned circumstances.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 379 thereof,
Having regard to the application by Denmark,
Whereas Denmark, by letter of 3 October 1995, applied to the Commission for authorization to invoke Article 379 of the Act of Accession for safeguard measures, aimed at solving the problem caused by the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, concerning pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected in Denmark by a product patent but not in Spain;
Whereas in their request, the Danish authorities provided the Commission with the material facts to enable it to evaluate the validity of the application;
Whereas the Danish authorities base their application upon the economic difficulties to which the Danish pharmaceutical products market would, according to them, be subjected as a result of the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, namely as from 7 October 1995; whereas the specialists argue that since the price of pharmaceuticals on the Spanish market is lower than the observed price for the same products on the Danish market, the expiry of the transitional period will lead to an appreciable increase in parallel imports from Spain into Denmark; whereas this increase will thus damage the market shares of Danish operators in the export market as from 1996;
Whereas Article 379 derogates from a fundamental principle of the EC Treaty, that of the free movement of goods; whereas consequently in accordance with the well-established case-law of the Court of Justice it should be restrictively interpreted;
Whereas consequently, in accordance with that case-law and with the established practice of the Commission in the past, Article 379 cannot apply;
Whereas the purpose of Article 379 is to rectify and adjust to the economy of the common market a given economic sector experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist;
Whereas an analysis of the economic data provided by the Danish authorities has shown that the conditions for the application of Article 379 are not fulfilled; whereas, more particularly, it has revealed that the Danish pharmaceutical industry is not experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist; whereas an increase in the volume of imports coming from Spain of pharmaceutical products patented in Denmark but not in Spain would not appear to be so significant in the long run as to bring about, by itself, serious economic difficulties on the Danish pharmaceutical market,","{'title': ""96/322/EC: Commission Decision of 20 December 1995 refusing Denmark's application for protective measures with regard to pharmaceutical products coming from Spain (Only the Danish text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe application for safeguard measures made by Denmark under Article 379 of the Act of Accession, aimed at solving the problem caused by the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, concerning pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected by a product patent in Denmark but not in Spain, is rejected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 1995.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario MONTI\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (1), and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/32/EC provides that the use of products intended for animal feed which contain levels of undesirable substances exceeding the maximum levels laid down in Annex I to that Directive is prohibited.
(2) As regards feedingstuffs obtained from the processing of fish or other marine animals, recent information provided by competent authorities of the Member States on the presence of total arsenic (sum of organic and inorganic arsenic) indicates that it is necessary to increase certain maximum levels for total arsenic. By-products of the fish filleting industry are valuable raw materials for the production of fish meal and fish oil for use in compound feed, in particular fish feed.
(3) The increase of the maximum levels for total arsenic in feedingstuffs obtained from the processing of fish or other marine animals and feedingstuffs for fish entails no change in the maximum levels for inorganic arsenic. Since the potential adverse effects of arsenic to animal and human health are determined by the inorganic fraction in a given feed or food product and the organic arsenic compounds exhibit a very low toxic potential (2), the increased levels for total arsenic do not affect the protection of animal and public health.
(4) In Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, arsenic refers to total arsenic for the purpose of setting maximum levels, since there is no standardised routine method for the analysis of inorganic arsenic. But for cases in which the competent authorities request an analysis of the content of inorganic arsenic, that Annex sets out a maximum level for inorganic arsenic.
(5) As the extraction method has in some cases a significant influence on the analytical result on total arsenic, it is appropriate to specify an extraction procedure for reference to be used for official control.
(6) Information provided by competent authorities and stakeholder organisations indicate significant levels of arsenic in additives belonging to the functional group of compounds of trace elements, authorised in application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). It is appropriate to establish maximum levels for arsenic in these additives to protect animal and public health.
(7) As regards theobromine, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) concluded in its opinion of 10 June 2008 (4) that the current maximum levels for theobromine may not fully protect some animal species. It pointed out possible adverse effects on pigs, dogs and horses and on milk production in dairy cows. It is therefore appropriate to establish lower maximum levels.
(8) As regards alkaloids in Datura sp., EFSA concluded in its opinion of 9 April 2008 (5) that, since tropane alkaloids are present in all Datura sp., it is appropriate for the protection of animal health, in particular for pigs, to extend the maximum levels for Datura stramonium L., as set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, to all Datura sp.
(9) As regards ricin (from Ricinus communis L.), EFSA concluded in its opinion of 10 June 2008 (6) that, given the similar toxic effects of the toxins from Ricinus communis L. (ricin), Croton tiglium L. (crotin) and Abrus precatorius L. (abrin), it is appropriate to apply the maximum levels for Ricinus communis L., as set out in Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC, also to Croton tiglium L. and Abrus precatorius L., separately or in combination.
(10) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,","{'header': '26.9.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 254/100', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2009/124/EC\nof 25 September 2009\namending Annex I to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards maximum levels for arsenic, theobromine,Daturasp.,Ricinus communisL.,Croton tigliumL. andAbrus precatoriusL.\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2002/32/EC provides that the use of products intended for animal feed which contain levels of undesirable substances exceeding the maximum levels laid down in Annex I to that Directive is prohibited.\n\n((2)) As regards feedingstuffs obtained from the processing of fish or other marine animals, recent information provided by competent authorities of the Member States on the presence of total arsenic (sum of organic and inorganic arsenic) indicates that it is necessary to increase certain maximum levels for total arsenic.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 103h(b) in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 establishes a common organisation of agricultural markets which includes the fruit and vegetables and processed fruit and vegetables sectors. Article 103e(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that in regions of the Member States where the degree of organisation of producers in the fruit and vegetable sector is particularly low, Member States may be authorised by the Commission, on a duly substantiated request, to pay producer organisations national financial assistance equal to a maximum of 80% of the financial contributions referred to in Article 103b(1)(a) of that Regulation.
(2) Article 91(1) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 (2) provides that for the purposes of Article 103e(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the degree of organisation of producers in a region of a Member State is to be calculated as the value of fruit and vegetable production that was obtained in the region and marketed by producer organisations, associations of producer organisations and producer groups divided by the total value of the fruit and vegetable production that was obtained in that region. In order to ensure the correct use of the national assistance, it is appropriate to clarify the rules on the calculation of the degree of organisation.
(3) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 91(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 a region is to be considered as a distinct part of the territory of a Member State, as a result of its administrative, geographical or economic characteristics. For the purposes of consistency and verifiability, it is appropriate to clarify the definition of a region and to lay down a minimum period of time during which changes to the definition of a region are not allowed, unless objectively justified.
(4) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The first subparagraph of Article 92(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 provides that requests to the Commission for the authorisation to grant national financial assistance for operational programmes to be implemented in any given calendar year are to be submitted by 31 January of that year. In order to allow the amended Article 91 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 to be applied in 2012, it is appropriate to provide for a derogation from the deadline provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 92(1) of that Implementing Regulation. Furthermore, a correction of requests sent before the entry into force of this Regulation should be provided for.
(6) In order to ensure that requests for authorisation to grant national financial assistance for operational programmes to be implemented in 2012 can be submitted in accordance with the new rules, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication. However, Article 95(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 also requires a request for Union reimbursement to be accompanied by evidence showing the degree of organisation of producers in the region concerned. This Regulation should therefore be without prejudice to requests for Union reimbursement in accordance with Article 95(1) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 543/2011 of national financial assistance authorised by the Commission before the date of entry into force of this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 lays down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption. In view of the strict nature of those rules, transitional measures have been granted.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2003 of 12 May 2003 on transitional measures under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the processing standards for category 3 material and manure used in composting plants (2) provides for certain transitional measures in order to give industry time to adjust and develop alternative processing standards for Category 3 material and manure used in composting plants until 31 December 2006.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 810/2003 of 12 May 2003 on transitional measures under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards processing standards for category 3 material and manure used in biogas plants (3) provides for certain transitional measures in order to give industry time to adjust and develop alternative processing standards for Category 3 material and manure used in biogas plants until 31 December 2006.
(4) On 7 September 2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued an opinion on the safety vis-à-vis biological risks of biogas and composting treatment standards of animal by-products.
(5) On the basis of the abovementioned EFSA opinion, Commission Regulation (EC) No 208/2006 of 7 February 2006 amending Annexes VI and VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards processing standards for biogas and composting plants and requirements for manure (4) was adopted on 7 February 2006, laying down validation requirements for alternative processing standards.
(6) The transitional measures laid down in Regulations (EC) No 809/2003 and (EC) No 810/2003 do not restrict the concerned operators in making use of the validation procedure introduced by Regulation (EC) No 208/2006.
(7) Alternative processing standards may now be approved by the competent authority of Member States if the validation has been carried out successfully. However, the Member States need more time to complete validation procedures.
(8) In addition, mesophilic fermentation processes are commonly used in certain regions of the EU. Such processes were not specifically addressed in the abovementioned EFSA opinion; however, they might not fulfil all requirements laid down for the validation of alternative processing standards. The Commission has therefore forwarded a question to EFSA seeking its advice on the safety of the mesophilic fermentation process. EFSA is currently evaluating the possible risks of this process.
(9) While awaiting this advice from EFSA and in order to provide additional time to Member States for the validation of alternative processes, the transitional measures provided for in Regulations (EC) No 809/2003 and (EC) No 810/2003 should be extended for a further period of time to enable the Member States to authorise operators to continue to apply national rules for the processing standards for Category 3 materials and manure used in composting and biogas plants.
(10) Regulations (EC) No 809/2003 and (EC) No 810/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2011 setting emission performance standards for new light commercial vehicles as part of the Union’s integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Where the Commission, in accordance with Article 8(6) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, confirms, and in accordance with Article 10(2) of that Regulation, makes public, that a manufacturer has failed to comply with Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, it shall in accordance with Article 9(1) of that Regulation impose excess emissions premiums on that manufacturer, or in the case of a pool, on the pool manager.
(2) It is necessary to adopt detailed arrangements for the collection of those excess emissions premiums.
(3) Pursuant to Article 9(4) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, the amounts of excess emissions premiums are to be considered as revenue for the general budget of the European Union and are to be entered and booked in title 7 of the general budget. It is therefore appropriate to apply as collection method the rules for recovery of receivable amounts set out in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (2) and Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3).
(4) For the purpose of establishing the amount receivable within the meaning of Article 71 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, it should be considered that, in accordance with Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011, the manufacturer is to be notified by the Commission of the provisional calculations of its average specific emissions of CO2 in the preceding year, the specific emissions target and the difference between its average specific emissions and the specific emissions target for that year, and must in accordance with Article 8(5) of that Regulation be given the possibility to verify those calculations and to notify the Commission of any errors within three months from receipt of the provisional calculations.
(5) In view of the exchange of views that takes place between the Commission and the manufacturer prior to the confirmation of the manufacturer’s performance in accordance with Article 8(6) and Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 and the possibility given to the manufacturer for raising objections against the calculation of its performance, it should be considered that the Commission by confirming the performance has demonstrated that the debt exists and that the amount receivable is certain within the meaning of Article 71 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
(6) The excess emissions premium is to be calculated in accordance with the formulae laid down in Article 9(2) of Regulation (EU) No 510/2011 and is to be made public pursuant to Article 10 of that Regulation. The amount receivable should therefore be considered as a fixed amount that is due within the meaning of Article 71 of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a letter registered by the Commission’s Secretariat-General on 11 November 2004, the Republic of Cyprus sought authorisation for a measure in existence prior to accession to the European Union and which derogates from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(2) The measure requiring a derogation is intended to counter tax avoidance through the manipulation of the value of supplies subject to value added tax (VAT).
(3) The measure should apply only in cases where the administration is able, based on the facts, to conclude that the determination of the taxable amount provided for in Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the said Directive is influenced by family, legal or business ties between the supplier and the recipient. In this matter the administration should not act on mere presumptions, and the parties concerned should be allowed to adduce evidence to the contrary where they dispute the level of the open market value established by the administration.
(4) The measure is strictly targeted so that it can only be invoked when a series of conditions have been met and an absolute tax loss identified; and is therefore proportionate to the aim pursued.
(5) Similar derogations have been granted to other Member States to counter tax avoidance and have been found to be effective.
(6) This derogation will safeguard the amount of VAT due at the final consumption stage and has no negative impact on the Communities’ own resources from VAT,","{'header': '24.3.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 78/48', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 14 March 2005\nauthorising the Republic of Cyprus to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes\n(2005/259/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In a letter registered by the Commission’s Secretariat-General on 11 November 2004, the Republic of Cyprus sought authorisation for a measure in existence prior to accession to the European Union and which derogates from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC.\n\n((2)) The measure requiring a derogation is intended to counter tax avoidance through the manipulation of the value of supplies subject to value added tax (VAT).\n\n((3)) The measure should apply only in cases where the administration is able, based on the facts, to conclude that the determination of the taxable amount provided for in Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the said Directive is influenced by family, legal or business ties between the supplier and the recipient.

(2) Imports of fresh meat must take into account the different epidemiological situations in the countries concerned, and indeed in the different parts of their territories.
(3) The responsible veterinary authorities of the concerned countries must confirm that their countries or regions have for at least 12 months been free from rinderpest, and foot-and-mouth disease, futhermore, the responsible authorities of the concerned countries must undertake to notify the Commission and the Member States within 24 hours, by fax, telex or telegram of the confirmation of the occurrence of any of the abovementioned diseases or an alteration in the vaccination policy against them.
(4) On 24 October 2000 the competent authorities of Uruguay confirmed an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the department of Artigas.
(5) The competent authorities of Uruguay provided satisfactory guarantees with regard to the measures taken to control the movement of animals of susceptible species within and out of the infected area, in particular by declaring the whole department of Artigas a control area for foot-and-mouth disease.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation) and in particular Articles 13(3), 14(3) and 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee in accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(3) of the basic Regulation,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST
(1) The European Commission (the Commission) has received a request pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the People’s Republic of China and to make imports of certain molybdenum wires consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland, whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not, subject to registration.
(2) The request was lodged on 4 April 2011 by the European Association of Metals (Eurometaux) on behalf of a Union producer of certain molybdenum wires.
B.   PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is molybdenum wire, containing by weight at least 99,95 % of molybdenum, of which the maximum cross-sectional dimension exceeds 1,35 mm but does not exceed 4,0 mm, originating in the People’s Republic of China, currently falling within CN code ex 8102 96 00 (the product concerned).
(4) The product under investigation is the same as that defined in the previous recital, but consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland, whether originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not, currently falling within the same CN code as the product concerned.
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 511/2010 (2).
D.   GROUNDS
(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of certain molybdenum wires originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of the transhipment via Malaysia and Switzerland.
E.   PROCEDURE
In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation, whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Switzerland or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
(a)   Questionnaires
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in Malaysia and Switzerland, to the known exporters/producers and to the known associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China, to the known importers and to the known associations of importers in the Union and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China, Malaysia and Switzerland. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Union industry.
In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation, and request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
The authorities of the People’s Republic of China, Malaysia and Switzerland will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Exemption of registration of imports or measures
In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Union, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers in Malaysia and Switzerland of certain molybdenum wires that can show that they are not related (3) to any producer subject to the measures (4) and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Article 13(1) and (2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.
F.   REGISTRATION
Pursuant to Article 14 (5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Malaysia and Switzerland.
G.   TIME LIMITS
In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— producers in Malaysia and Switzerland may request exemption from registration of imports or measures,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION
The investigation will be concluded, according to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union.
J.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (5).
K.   HEARING OFFICER
It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of Directorate-General for Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas completing the internal market depends on the elimination of physical frontiers between Member States; whereas a satisfactory level of information on the trading of goods between Member States must therefore be ensured by means other than those  involving, checks, even indirect ones, at internal frontiers;
Whereas it will consequently be necessary to collect directly from consignors and consignees the data necessary to compile statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, using methods and techniques which will ensure that they are  exhaustive, reliable and up-to-date, without giving rise for the parties concerned, in particular for small and medium-sized businesses, to a burden out of proportion to the results which users of the said statistics can reasonably expect;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 of 7 November 1991 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (4) provides that the conditions should be created for increased use of automatic data processing and electronic data  transmission for the purpose of facilitating the task of the parties responsible for providing information;
Whereas it is necessary to ease the burden which statistical returns place on businesses, while at the same time improving the circulation of statistical information with a view to the creation of the European information market;
Whereas an essential objective of the future Council Decision adopting a multiannual Community programme to support the implementation of trans-European information networks for the interchange of data between administrations (IDA) is to carry out  feasibility studies, including validation schemes; whereas that Decision should be supplemented by measures of an operational character, particularly in the statistical sphere;
Whereas the compilation of harmonized statistics, in particular with a link between statistics on trade and other economic statistics, should be ensured in order to contribute to market transparency and to the evaluation of the competitiveness of  businesses;
Whereas the promotion of the use of harmonized standards and concepts at European level will ultimately lead to the elimination of duplication and to economies of scale, while facilitating the emergence of new services in the field of statistical  telematics;
Whereas standardization carried out at international level in the sphere of electronic data interchange (EDI) contributes to facilitating international trade and to simplifying relations between undertakings and administrative authorities;
Whereas the establishment of common statistical standards for the production of harmonized information is an activity which can be carried out effectively only at Community level, in collaboration with the Member States; whereas such standards will be  implemented in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of official statistics;
Whereas the Treaty does not provide for powers other than those in Article 235 for the adoption of this Decision,","{'title': '94/445/EC: Council Decision of 11 July 1994 on inter- administration telematic networks for statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (Edicom)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nA set of measures, hereinafter referred to as 'Edicom' (Electronic Data Interchange on Commerce), shall be implemented to facilitate the conversion of regional, national and Community sytems towards interoperable systems at European level, as  a first stage, for the collection of returns on the trading of goods between Member States from businesses, the validation and pre-processing of such returns and the dissemination of the statistics derived therefrom.\n\nThese systems shall be based on distributed information systems at regional, national and Community levels, the interoperability of which shall be guaranteed by the development and use of harmonized standards and communication procedures.\n\nThese systems shall be based in particular on the use of electronic data interchange (EDI) for the transmission of statistical returns.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 580/2004
of 26 March 2004
establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 26(3) and Article 31(3)(b) and (14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 the difference between the prices in world trade and in the Community may be covered for certain milk products by export refunds to the extent necessary to enable those products to be exported within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) This Regulation should cover export refunds for skimmed milk powder and butter covered by certain product codes listed in section 9 of Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 of 17 December 1987 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds (2). For the purpose of this Regulation the products in question should be in a bulk pack. In addition, it is necessary to limit the scope of footnote 13 to section 9 in relation to skimmed milk powder by setting a maximum limit for non-lactic additions to ensure that offers are made for a standard product.
(3) In order to achieve an efficient administration of Community funds, to take better account of changing export possibilities for the products concerned and to increase transparency and the opportunity for operators to participate in the export scheme, refunds for those products should be fixed by a tender procedure, as was already provided for in Article 17(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 (3).
(4) The destinations for which refunds may be fixed are indicated in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1523/2003 of 28 August 2003 fixing the export refund on milk and milk products (4).
(5) To ensure equal treatment for all interested parties, all Commission decisions relating to the tender should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(6) In order to reduce the administrative burden on operators and national administrations the tendering procedure should be incorporated in the export licence application procedure and the tender security should also constitute the licence security. Tenders should contain the data needed to assess them, and communications between Member States and the Commission should be provided for. In view of the sensitivity of the data concerned, tenders should not be examined in public.
(7) A tendering security should ensure that the accepted quantities are exported pursuant to the licence issued under the invitation to tender. The security should accordingly be forfeited where quantities are not exported. Therefore provisions should be adopted for the lodging, the release and the forfeiting of the tendering security in addition to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2220/85 of 22 July 1985 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of securities for agricultural products (5).
(8) A maximum export refund should be fixed. However, situations may arise on the market in which economic or other aspects urge that none of the tenders received be accepted.
(9) Detailed rules should be laid down to ensure that tenderers are notified of the outcome of the invitation to tender and that the necessary licences are issued for the export of the quantities allocated.
(10) By way of derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), the rights deriving from licences should be confined to the successful tenderers to avoid speculation.
(11) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products (7), applies to all export licences and export refunds in the dairy sector. To the extent necessary derogations from this Regulation should be provided. They should concern the refund amount applicable, the provision relating to applications lodged on Thursdays and the product code of the nomenclature for refunds indicated in licences. In addition, as licences issued in the context of the tender are for specific products, the provisions in relation to the use of a licence for another product should not be applicable. To ensure all licences have the same validity period the closing date for the submission of tenders should be taken as the commencement date.
(12) The Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 580/2004 of 26 March 2004 establishing a tender procedure concerning export refunds for certain milk products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nScope\n\nThis Regulation provides for a tender procedure for fixing export refunds on the following milk products, listed in section 9 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87, of Community origin:\n\n(a) skimmed milk powder in bags of at least 25 kilograms net weight and containing no more than 0,5 % by weight of added non-lactic matter falling under product code ex 0402 10 19 90/00;\n\n(b) natural butter in blocks of at least 20 kilograms net weight falling under product codes ex 0405 10 19 95/00 and ex 0405 10 19 97/00;\n\n(c) butteroil in containers of at least 190 kilograms net weight falling under product code ex 0405 90 10 90/00.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nTendering procedure\n\n1.

Col. Eric Badege had become the focal point of M23 in Masisi and commanded joint operations …’ with another military leader. Additionally, ‘a series of coordinated attacks carried out in August [2012] by LTL. Col. Badege … enabled M23 to destabilize a considerable part of Masisi territory.’‘According to former combatants, LTL Col. Badege … acted under the orders of Col. Makenga when he orchestrated the attacks.’\n31.12.2012\nAs a military commander of M23, Badege is responsible for serious violations involving the targeting of children or women in situations of armed conflict. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, there have been several major incidents of indiscriminate killings of civilians, including women and children. Since May 2012 Raia Mutomboki, under the command of M23, have killed hundreds of civilians in a series of coordinated attacks. In August, Badege carried out joint attacks which involved the indiscriminate killing of civilians. The November Group of Experts report states that these attacks were jointly orchestrated by Badege and Colonel Makoma Semivumbi Jacques. According to the Group of Experts Report, local leaders from Masisi stated that Badege commanded these Raia Mutomboki attacks on the ground.\nAccording to a 28 July 2012, Radio Okapi article, ‘the administrator of Masisi announced this Saturday, 28 July, the defection of the commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 410th Regiment FARDC base Nabiondo, about thirty kilometres northwest of Goma in North Kivu. According to him, Colonel Eric Badege and more than a hundred soldiers headed Friday to Rubaya, 80 kilometres north of Nabiondo. This information has been confirmed by several sources.’\nAccording to a 23 November 2012 BBC article, M23 was formed when former members of the CNDP who had been integrated into the FARDC began to protest against bad conditions and pay, and lack of full implementation of the 23 March 2009 peace deal between the CNDP and the DRC that led to the CNDP’s integration into the FARDC.\nM23 has been engaged in active military operations in order to take control of territory in eastern DRC, according to the November 2012 IPIS report. M23 and FARDC fought over control of several towns and villages in eastern DRC on 24 July and 25 July 2012; M23 attacked the FARDC in Rumangabo on 26 July 2012; M23 drove FARDC from Kibumba on 17 November 2012; and M23 took control of Goma on 20 November 2012.\nAccording to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, several ex-M23 combatants claim that M23 leaders summarily executed dozens of children who attempted to escape after being recruited as M23 child soldiers.\nAccording to an 11 September 2012 report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), a Rwandan man, 18, who escaped after being forcibly recruited in Rwanda told HRW that he witnessed the execution of a 16-year-old boy from his M23 unit who had tried to flee in June. The boy was captured and beaten to death by M23 fighters in front of the other recruits. An M23 commander who ordered his killing then allegedly told the other recruits ‘[h]e wanted to abandon us,’ as an explanation for why the boy had been killed. The report also states that witnesses claimed that at least 33 new recruits and other M23 fighters were summarily executed when they attempted to flee. Some were tied up and shot in front of other recruits as an example of the punishment they could receive. One young recruit told HRW, ‘[w]hen we were with M23, they said [we had a choice] and could stay with them or we could die. Lots of people tried to escape. Some were found and then that was immediately their death.’\nRUNIGA, Jean-Marie Lugerero\nApproximately 1960\nA 9 July 2012 document signed by M23 leader Sultani Makenga named Runiga as the coordinator of the political wing of M23. According to the document, Runiga’s appointment was prompted by the need to ensure the visibility of the M23 cause.\nRuniga is named as the ‘President’ of the M23 in postings on the group’s website. His leadership role is corroborated by the November 2012 Group of Experts report, which refers to Runiga as the ‘leader of the M23’.\n31.12.2012\nAccording to a 13 December 2012 Associated Press article, Runiga showed the Associated Press a list of demands that he said will be presented to the Congolese government. Included in the demands are the resignation of Kabila and the dissolution of the national assembly. Runiga indicated that if given the opportunity, M23 could retake Goma. ‘And at this time we will not retreat,’ Runiga told the Associated Press. He also indicated that M23’s political branch should resume its control of Goma as a precondition to negotiations. ‘I think our members who are in Kampala represent us. In due time I will be there, too. I am waiting for things to be organised and when Kabila will be there, I will go, too,’ Runiga said.\nAccording to a 26 November 2012\nLe Figaro\narticle, Runiga met with DRC President Kabila on 24 November 2012 to begin discussions. Separately, in an interview with\nLe Figaro\n, Runiga stated, ‘M23 is composed primarily of former FARDC military members who defected to protest the non-respect of the 23 March 2009 accords.’ He added, ‘M23’s soldiers are deserters from the army who left with their arms in hand. Recently, we recovered a lot of equipment from a military base in Bunagana. For the moment, this allows us to regain territory each day and to repel all the attacks from the FARDC … Our revolution is Congolese, led by the Congolese, for the Congolese people.’\nAccording to a 22 November 2012 Reuters article, Runiga stated that M23 had the capacity to hang on to Goma after M23’s forces were bolstered by mutinying Congolese soldiers from the FARDC: ‘Firstly we have a disciplined army, and also we have the FARDC soldiers who’ve joined us. They’re our brothers, they’ll be retrained and recycled then we’ll work with them.’\nAccording to a 27 November 2012 article published in\nThe Guardian\n, Runiga indicated that M23 would refuse to obey a call by regional leaders of the International Conference of the Great Lakes to leave Goma in order to pave the way for peace talks. Instead, Runiga stated that M23’s withdrawal from Goma would be the result, not a precondition, of negotiation.\nAccording to the 15 November 2012 Final Report of the Group of Experts, Runiga led a delegation that travelled to Kampala, Uganda on 29 July 2012 and finalised the M23 movement’s 21-point agenda ahead of anticipated negotiations at the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region.\nAccording to a 23 November 2012 BBC article, M23 was formed when former members of the CNDP who had been integrated into the FARDC began to protest against bad conditions and pay, and lack of full implementation of the 23 March 2009 peace deal between the CNDP and the DRC that led to the CNDP’s integration into the FARDC.\nM23 has been engaged in active military operations in order to take control of territory in eastern DRC, according to the November 2012 IPIS report.

The group was formed in 2000, and, as detailed below, has committed serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children in armed conflict in the DRC, including killing and maiming, sexual violence, and forced displacement.\nAccording to a 2010 report from Amnesty International on Human Rights in the DRC, the FDLR were responsible for the killings of 96 civilians in Busurguni, Walikali territory. Some of the victims were burned alive in their homes.\n31.12.2012\nAccording to a 2010 report from Amnesty International on Human Rights in the DRC, in June 2010, an NGO medical centre reported around 60 cases a month of girls and women who had been raped in the southern Lubero territory, North Kivu armed groups including the FDLR.\nAccording to a 20 December 2010 report from Human Rights Watch (HRW), there has been documented evidence of the FDLR actively conducting child recruitment. HRW has identified at least 83 Congolese children under the age of 18, some as young as 14, who have been forcibly recruited by the FDLR.\nIn January of 2012, HRW reported that FLDR combatants attacked numerous villages in the Masisi territory, killing six civilians, raping two women, and abducting at least 48 people whose whereabouts remain unknown. According to a June 2012 report from HRW, in May 2012 FDLR fighters attacked civilians in Kamananga and Lumenje, in South Kivu province, as well as in Chambucha, Walikale territory, and villages in the Ufumandu area of Masisi territory, North Kivu province. In these attacks, FDLR fighters with machetes and knives hacked to death dozens of civilians, including numerous children.\nAccording to the June 2012 Group of Experts Report, the FDLR attacked several villages in South Kivu from 31 December 2011 to 4 January 2012. A United Nations investigation confirmed that at least 33 persons, including 9 children and 6 women, had been killed, either burned alive, decapitated or shot during the attack. In addition, one woman and one girl had been raped. The June 2012 Group of Experts Report also states that a United Nations investigation confirmed that the FDLR massacred at least 14 civilians, including 5 women and 5 children in South Kivu in May 2012. According to the November 2012 Group of Experts report, the UN documented at least 106 incidents of sexual violence committed by the FDLR between December 2011 and September 2012. The November 2012 Group of Experts report notes that, according to a UN investigation, the FDLR raped seven women in the night of 10 March 2012, including a minor, in Kalinganya, Kabare territory. The FDLR attacked the village again on 10 April 2012 and raped three of the women for the second time. The November 2012 Group of Experts report also reports 11 killings by the FDLR in Bushibwambombo, Kalehe, on 6 April 2012, and FDLR involvement in 19 further killings in Masisi territory, including five minors and six women, in May.\nM23\nThe Mouvement du 23 Mars (M23) is an armed group operating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that has been the recipient in the territory of the DRC of arms and related materiel, including advice, training, and assistance related to military activities. Several eyewitness testimonies state that M23 receives general military supplies from the Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) in the form of weapons and ammunition in addition to materiel support for combat operations.\n31.12.2012\nM23 has been complicit in and responsible for committing serious violations of international law involving the targeting of women and children in situations of armed conflict in the DRC including killing and maiming, sexual violence, abduction, and forced displacement. According to numerous reports, investigations, and testimonies from eyewitnesses, M23 has been responsible for carrying out mass killings of civilians, as well as raping women and children throughout various regions of the DRC. Several reports indicate that M23 fighters have carried out 46 rapes against women and girls, the youngest of which was 8 years old. In addition to reports of sexual violence, M23 has also carried out extensive forced recruitment campaigns of children into the ranks of the group. It is estimated that M23 has carried out the forced recruitment of 146 young men and boys in the Rutshuru territory alone in eastern DRC since July 2012. Some of the victims have been as young as 15 years old.\nThe atrocities committed by M23 against the civilian population of the DRC, as well as M23’s forced recruitment campaign, and being the recipient of arms and military assistance has dramatically contributed to instability and conflict within the region and in some instances, violated international law.'}]}"

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics (1) and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 establishes a legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, including the general provisions on protection of and access to confidential data.
(2) The benefits of data collected for the purposes of European statistics should be maximised, inter alia, by improving the access to confidential data by researchers for scientific purposes.
(3) Many questions raised in the fields of economic, social, environmental and political sciences can be answered adequately only on the basis of relevant and detailed data allowing in-depth analyses. The quality and the timeliness of available detailed information for research has, in this context, become an important component of a science-based understanding and governance of society.
(4) The research community should, therefore, enjoy wider access to confidential data used for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics, for analysis in the interest of scientific progress, without compromising the high level of protection that confidential statistical data require.
(5) Bodies with the objective of promoting and providing access to data in the interest of scientific research in socially- and policy-relevant areas could contribute to the process of releasing confidential data for scientific purposes, thereby improving the accessibility of confidential data.
(6) A risk management approach should be the most efficient model with a view to making a wider range of confidential data available for scientific purposes while preserving the confidentiality of respondents and statistical units.
(7) The physical and logical protection of confidential data should be ensured by regulatory, administrative, technical and organisational measures. These measures should not be so excessive as to limit the utility of the data for the purpose of scientific research.
(8) To this effect, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, Member States and the Commission should take appropriate measures to prevent and sanction any violations of statistical confidentiality.
(9) This Regulation ensures, in particular, full respect for private and family life and for the protection of personal data (Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union).
(10) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (2) and to Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).
(11) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information (4) and to Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies (5).
(12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community statistics, concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes (6) should be repealed.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 of 16 March 1987 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1566/93 (2), and in particular Article 39 (9), (10) and (11) thereof,
Whereas the data available at present to the Commission, and in particular those in the forward estimate for the 1993/94 wine year, show that a feature of the current year is an imbalance on the market for table wine and wine suitable for yielding table  wine; whereas the conditions laid down in Article 39 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 for initiating compulsory distillation are therefore fulfilled;
Whereas in view of the prices and the desirable level of availability at the end of the year, the distillation of 18 200 000 hectolitres of table wine appears necessary in the Community; whereas that quantity is based on the forward estimate to take  account of the unbalanced situation, characterized in particular by stocks carried over from one wine year to the next, which are higher than the estimates used as the basis for establishing the financial data for the wine year;
Whereas the experience acquired in the previous marketing year of the option whereby grape must intended for the production after 15 March of products other than table wine may be deducted from the volume to be used for determining the quantity of wine  to be delivered for distillation is inadequate for judging the effect of the measure; whereas that option should be made available again in the current marketing year so that its impact can be assessed;
Whereas a large number of small producers of grapes belong to cooperative wineries or producer groups; whereas the articles of association of these organizations are such that in certain production regions the delivery obligation provided for in Article  39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 falls on the organization as a whole and in others falls on the producers individually; whereas in consequence there is a danger that the exemption provided for small producers will differ greatly in effect between  regions; whereas both this fact and the difficulties that were produced by the introduction of a dual exemption arrangement within regions must be taken into account for the fixing of the minimum quantity for delivery by producers;
Whereas experience has shown that the fulfilment of a producer's obligation through the delivery of wine obtained in a region of production other than that of the production of the said winegrower has contributed to the imbalance on the market in  certain regions; whereas the obligation should be considered as fulfilled only where wine delivered and wine which is the subject of the obligation are obtained from the same region;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 39 (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87, distillers may either receive aid in respect of the product to be distilled or deliver the product obtained from distillation to the intervention agency; whereas the amount of the  aid must be fixed on the basis of the criteria laid down in Article 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2046/89 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1567/93 (4);
Whereas the derogation provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 39 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 was extended for one wine year by Regulation (EEC) No 1566/93; whereas the detailed rules relating thereto must be extended for the same  period;

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 12 February 1986
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electronic typewriters manufactured by Nakajima All Precision Co. Ltd and originating in Japan
(86/34/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1) and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
1. The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2812/85 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of electronic typewriters manufactured by Nakajima All Precision Co Ltd (Nakajima) and originating in Japan.
B. Subsequent procedure
2. Following the imposition of the provisional duty, Nakajima and one unrelated importer requested and were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. The Commission informed them in detail of the facts on which it based its provisional findings. Nakajima and the unrelated importer also made written submissions making known their views on the findings.
3. Upon its request, Nakajima was also informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of a definitive duty and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of a provisional duty. It was granted a period within which it could make representations subsequent to these disclosure meetings. Its comments were taken into consideration.
4. In view of the fact that a considerable amount of time has elapsed since the initiation of the proceeding in March 1984 and that the provisional findings were based on a 12-month period prior to that initiation and that the proceeding with regard to Nakajima had in the meantime been terminated and then re-opened, it was considered appropriate to base the definitive findings on an updated period of investigation. The period therefore chosen was 1 May 1984 to 30 April 1985. To this end Nakajima submitted all relevant data and supporting documentation.
C. Normal value
5. As had already been established provisionally, it was finally found that Nakajima's sales on the domestic Japanese market were not sufficiently large to allow the determination of normal value on that basis. Consequently, normal value for all models of electronic typewriters was established on the basis of constructed value.
Nakajima claimed again that a profit margin lower than that referred to in recital 16 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 (3) and recital 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2812/85 should be used and justified this claim on the basis of Nakajima's particular structure.
For this purpose, Nakajima submitted evidence which showed that Nakajima, contrary to all other Japanese firms involved in the proceeding concerning electronic typewriters from Japan, was basically a factory only without a conventional sales force or sales structure for any of the very limited number of products it manufactured. Nakajima only sold to a handful of customers worldwide.
It was therefore considered unreasonable to apply to Nakajima the same profit margin, as that referred to in Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85, which was determined for a firm with completely different characteristics.
No other exporter involved in this proceeding for which a profit margin on its domestic sales could be established was structured in a way comparable to Nakajima.
In view of the foregoing, Nakajima proposed that a profit margin of 26 % on turnover should be used for the determination of normal value. In view of the company's performance and its pricing policy this margin was considered reasonable.
Nakajima submitted further evidence with regard to certain other aspects of the normal value computation,
especially cost elements, direct and indirect labour and research and development. After examination, the data submitted were found acceptable.
D. Export price
6. Export prices have been definitively determined on the basis of the prices actually paid by the importers in the Community.
E. Dumping margin
7. The definitive comparison made at ex-factory level between normal value and export price on a transaction by transaction basis, shows the existence of dumping in respect of exports to the Community of electronic typewriters manufactured by Nakajima, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. The weighted average dumping margin for all exports to the Community was found to be 1,48 %.
In view of the characteristics of the market for the product concerned, this dumping margin should be regarded as de minimis.
8. Consequently no protective action should be taken against imports of electronic typewriters manufactured by Nakajima,",{'title': '86/34/EEC: Commission Decision of 12 February 1986 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electronic typewriters manufactured by Nakajima All Precision Co.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '23.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 340/47', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2132/2005\nof 22 December 2005\nfixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose;

Whereas, by letter dated 8 November 1983, the Federal Republic of Germany requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the 'Acutronic - Single Axis Rate Table, model 230 T/30 H', ordered on 10 July 1979 and intended to be used for precise measurement of laser gyros in the framework of the 'optic gyros' project, should be considered as a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community; whereas, however, the Federal Republic of Germany reserved its decision to the case where the object in question may be considered as an accessory;
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79, a group of experts composed of representatives of all the Member States met on 11 April 1984 within the framework of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements to examine the matter;

Whereas with effect from 1 January 1990 the possibility afforded Member States of continuing to tax or exempt certain transactions listed in Annexes E and F to the Sixth Directive was terminated by virtue of Article 1, point 1, first paragraph, and point 2 (a) of Council Directive 89/465/EEC (3); whereas, consequently, the authorizations granted in this connection by the Commission for the purposes of determining the VAT own resources base should also be discontinued;
Whereas, in the case of Portugal, the Commission, on the basis of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, adopted Decision 92/164/Euratom, EEC (4) authorizing Portugal to use statistics for years earlier than the last year but one for the 1989 and 1990 financial years and, with effect from 1989, not to take into account certain categories of transactions and to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base;
Whereas, for the purposes of the breakdown by rate provided for in Article 4 (4) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, Portugal is still unable to use the national accounts relating to the last year but one before the financial year for which the VAT resources base is to be calculated since only the national accounts relating to 1986 are sufficiently detailed to allow calculation of the weighted average rate; whereas Portugal should therefore be authorized to use the national accounts relating to 1986 to calculate the weighted average rate for the 1991 financial year;
Whereas Portugal began taxing the transactions referred to in point 3 of Annex F to the Sixth VAT Directive on 1 January 1991; whereas the authorization granted in respect of such transactions should be discontinued with effect from that date;

Cans with the same coating are used for the canning of food and in accordance with the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) a scientific opinion on melamine in food and feed (2), a specific migration limit (SML) of 2,5 mg/kg for the canned food as such has been established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 of 14 January 2011 on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (3) as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1282/2011 (4).
(3) The Codex Alimentarius Commission has established maximum levels for melamine in feed and food (5) which are to apply to feed as sold, while the maximum levels established in Directive 2002/32/EC concern feed with a moisture content of 12 %.
(4) Recently provided information has demonstrated that melamine can migrate in wet pet food from the can coating at a level above 2,5 mg/kg relative to a feed with a moisture content of 12 % but below the SML of 2,5 mg/kg in the wet pet food. In the light of this development in scientific and technical knowledge, it is appropriate to establish the maximum level of 2,5 mg/kg for melamine for canned wet pet food on a ‘as sold’ basis and this in line with what is foreseen for canned food.
(5) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae (1), and in particular Article 12(1) and (4), and the introductory phrase of Article 19 and points (i) and (ii) of Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992, laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (2), and in particular Article 17(3)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 90/426/EEC lays down animal health conditions for the importation into the Community of live equidae. It provides that imports of equidae into the Community are only authorised from third countries or parts of the territory thereof, which have been free from glanders for a period of at least six months.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species (3) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to that Decision.
(3) Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis and glanders do occur in parts of the territory of Brazil and therefore imports of equidae, and as a consequence of their semen, ova and embryos, are only allowed from the disease free parts of the territory of that country described as ‘BR-1’ in column 4 of Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC. The State of São Paulo is included in that list.
(4) In September 2008, Brazil notified the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of the confirmation of a case of glanders in a horse in the suburbs of the State of São Paulo. Since that State is no longer free from glanders, it should be deleted from the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.
(5) However, in the light of the information and guarantees provided by Brazil, it is possible to allow for a limited period of time from a part of the territory of the State of São Paulo the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 93/195/EEC of 2 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export (4).
(6) In addition, the list set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should take account of the separation of the customs territories of Montenegro and Serbia and those two third countries should be listed separately, thus allowing the importation of live equidae, their semen, ova and embryos from both Montenegro and Serbia under the same additional conditions as specified at present for ‘Serbia and Montenegro’ in that Annex.
(7) Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries(1), and in particular Article 22 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2000/418/EC of 29 June 2000 regulating the use of material presenting risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and amending Decision 94/474/EC(2), as last amended by Decision 2001/233/EC(3), provides for the removal and destruction of certain specified risk materials. It also imposes restrictions on the production of certain materials and of certain slaughter techniques and on certain imports. It is to be reviewed in the light of new scientific evidence.
(2) The exposure of humans to the risks stemming from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been largely associated with the consumption of meat mechanically recovered from the bones of the head and vertebral column. However, for control reasons the prohibition on the use of bones of the head and vertebral column from bovine, ovine and caprine animals of all ages for the production of mechanically recovered meat should be extended to all bones of those species. This should also apply to imported products.
(3) In its opinions of 6 July 2000, 12 January 2001 and 8 and 9 February 2001 on the Geographic BSE Risk of the concerned third countries, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is only highly unlikely in the following countries: Australia, Argentina, Botswana, Chile, Namibia, New-Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Swaziland. For all other countries for which the evaluation by the SSC has been finalised it concluded that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is at best unlikely but not excluded. Preliminary results of similar studies carried out under the responsibility of the SSC further indicate that it may, for a very limited number of additional countries, conclude that the occurrence of BSE in native cattle is highly unlikely. All other third countries either sent no dossier or an incomplete dossier precluding a timely and conclusive evaluation.
(4) Therefore it was demonstrated by the SSC risk assessment that the risk of BSE being present in native cattle is highly unlikely only in Australia, Argentina, Botswana, Chile, Namibia, New-Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Swaziland. For all other countries that assessment either demonstrated a certain risk of BSE being present in native cattle, or could not be carried out in absence of complete data. Therefore only Australia, Argentina, Botswana, Chile, Namibia, New-Zealand, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Swaziland should be exempt from the provisions of Decision 2000/418/EC.
(5) The Commission will review the provisions for the import of products of animal origin as soon as possible in the light of additional scientific assessments, as well as the development of the recommendations of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). As before the Commission will use the information submitted in accordance with Recommendation 98/477/EC(4) of 22 July 1998 concerning information necessary to support applications for the evaluation of the epidemiological status of countries with respect to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. It therefore repeats its invitation to submit a dossier in accordance with that Recommendation for those countries that have not yet done so and will make every effort to obtain a scientific assessment within the shortest possible time of the dossier submission.
(6) Considering that a new certification regime is established, a transitional arrangement should be provided for products dispatched before the entry into force of this Decision.
(7) The vertebral column must be removed at the latest at the point of sale to the consumer, and thus carcasses or parts of carcasses of bovine animals that still contain vertebral column may be placed on the domestic market and traded between Member States. In order to respect the Community's obligations under international agreements, it is necessary also to authorise imports from third countries of such carcasses containing vertebral column.
(8) Decision 2000/418/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,","{'title': '2001/270/EC: Commission Decision of 29 March 2001 amending Decision 2000/418/EC as regards imports from third countries (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2001) 830)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 2000/418/EC is amended as follows:\n\n1.

(2) Taking account of the conditions for the production of certain cuts of boned beef and veal and for placing them in storage, thus making them eligible under the arrangements for the advance payment of the refund, and also of the way in which those products are exported, the control provisions laid down in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should be supplemented with specific provisions. Those additional provisions concern, in particular, the creation of a computerised database by those operators who wish to participate in these arrangements, approved by the customs authorities responsible for control and to which the latter must have direct access.
(3) A derogation should be made for some beef and veal products from the maximum period for which products may remain under a customs-warehousing or free-zone procedure provided for in Article 29(5) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999. In order for these arrangements to function, in view of the special conditions prevailing in the beef and veal sector, that period should be four months.
(4) In order to make operations more transparent and checks quicker and more effective, the number of operations to be subject to either phase of the procedure should be restricted.
(5) In order to ensure the smooth operation of these arrangements, the control criteria and frequency and the consequences to be drawn where a discrepancy is detected between the actual stocks and the database should be laid down.

Paragraphs 27A and 27B are added.\nSIGNIFICANCE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE\nOther disclosures\nFair value\n27\nAn entity shall disclose for each class of financial instruments the methods and, when a valuation technique is used, the assumptions applied in determining fair values of each class of financial assets or financial liabilities. For example, if applicable, an entity discloses information about the assumptions relating to prepayment rates, rates of estimated credit losses, and interest rates or discount rates. If there has been a change in valuation technique, the entity shall disclose that change and the reasons for making it.\n27A\nTo make the disclosures required by paragraph 27B an entity shall classify fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements. The fair value hierarchy shall have the following levels:\n(a)\nquoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1);\n(b)\ninputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly (ie derived from prices) (Level 2); and\n(c)\ninputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs) (Level 3).\nThe level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety. If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement. Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.\n27B\nFor fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position an entity shall disclose for each class of financial instruments:\n(a)\nthe level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety, segregating fair value measurements in accordance with the levels defined in paragraph 27A.\n(b)\nany significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers. Transfers into each level shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level. For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities.\n(c)\nfor fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, a reconciliation from the beginning balances to the ending balances, disclosing separately changes during the period attributable to the following:\n(i)\ntotal gains or losses for the period recognised in profit or loss, and a description of where they are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented);\n(ii)\ntotal gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income;\n(iii)\npurchases, sales, issues and settlements (each type of movement disclosed separately); and\n(iv)\ntransfers into or out of Level 3 (eg transfers attributable to changes in the observability of market data) and the reasons for those transfers. For significant transfers, transfers into Level 3 shall be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of Level 3.\n(d)\nthe amount of total gains or losses for the period in (c)(i) above included in profit or loss that are attributable to gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and a description of where those gains or losses are presented in the statement of comprehensive income or the separate income statement (if presented).\n(e)\nfor fair value measurements in Level 3, if changing one or more of the inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would change fair value significantly, the entity shall state that fact and disclose the effect of those changes. The entity shall disclose how the effect of a change to a reasonably possible alternative assumption was calculated. For this purpose, significance shall be judged with respect to profit or loss, and total assets or total liabilities, or, when changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, total equity.\nAn entity shall present the quantitative disclosures required by this paragraph in tabular format unless another format is more appropriate.\nParagraph 39 is amended. Paragraph 44G is added.\nLiquidity risk\n39\nAn entity shall disclose:\n(a)\na maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities (including issued financial guarantee contracts) that shows the remaining contractual maturities.\n(b)\na maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities. The maturity analysis shall include the remaining contractual maturities for those derivative financial liabilities for which contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows (see paragraph B11B).\n(c)\na description of how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in (a) and (b).\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n44G\nImproving Disclosures about Financial Instruments\n(Amendments to IFRS 7), issued in March 2009, amended paragraphs 27, 39 and B11 and added paragraphs 27A, 27B, B10A and B11A–B11F. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009. In the first year of application, an entity need not provide comparative information for the disclosures required by the amendments. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies the amendments for an earlier period, it shall disclose that fact.\nAppendix A\nDefined terms\nThe following term is amended.\nliquidity risk\nThe risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.\nAppendix B\nApplication guidance\nA heading and paragraph B11 are amended. Paragraphs B10A and B11A–B11F are added and paragraphs B12–B16 are deleted. Paragraphs B12 and B13 are replaced by paragraph B11C(a) and (b). Paragraphs B14 and B16 are replaced by paragraph B11D.\nNature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments (paragraphs 31–42)\nQuantitative liquidity risk disclosures (paragraphs 34(a) and 39(a) and (b))\nB10A\nIn accordance with paragraph 34(a) an entity discloses summary quantitative data about its exposure to liquidity risk on the basis of the information provided internally to key management personnel. An entity shall explain how those data are determined. If the outflows of cash (or another financial asset) included in those data could either:\n(a)\noccur significantly earlier than indicated in the data, or\n(b)\nbe for significantly different amounts from those indicated in the data (eg for a derivative that is included in the data on a net settlement basis but for which the counterparty has the option to require gross settlement),\nthe entity shall state that fact and provide quantitative information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the extent of this risk unless that information is included in the contractual maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) or (b).\nB11\nIn preparing the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) an entity uses its judgement to determine an appropriate number of time bands. For example, an entity might determine that the following time bands are appropriate:\n(a)\nnot later than one month;\n(b)\nlater than one month and not later than three months;\n(c)\nlater than three months and not later than one year; and\n(d)\nlater than one year and not later than five years.\nB11A\nIn complying with paragraph 39(a) and (b), an entity shall not separate an embedded derivative from a hybrid (combined) financial instrument. For such an instrument, an entity shall apply paragraph 39(a).\nB11B\nParagraph 39(b) requires an entity to disclose a quantitative maturity analysis for derivative financial liabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities if the contractual maturities are essential for an understanding of the timing of the cash flows. For example, this would be the case for:\n(a)\nan interest rate swap with a remaining maturity of five years in a cash flow hedge of a variable rate financial asset or liability.\n(b)\nall loan commitments.\nB11C\nParagraph 39(a) and (b) requires an entity to disclose maturity analyses for financial liabilities that show the remaining contractual maturities for some financial liabilities. In this disclosure:\n(a)\nwhen a counterparty has a choice of when an amount is paid, the liability is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, financial liabilities that an entity can be required to repay on demand (eg demand deposits) are included in the earliest time band.\n(b)\nwhen an entity is committed to make amounts available in instalments, each instalment is allocated to the earliest period in which the entity can be required to pay. For example, an undrawn loan commitment is included in the time band containing the earliest date it can be drawn down.\n(c)\nfor issued financial guarantee contracts the maximum amount of the guarantee is allocated to the earliest period in which the guarantee could be called.\nB11D\nThe contractual amounts disclosed in the maturity analyses as required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) are the contractual undiscounted cash flows, for example:\n(a)\ngross finance lease obligations (before deducting finance charges);\n(b)\nprices specified in forward agreements to purchase financial assets for cash;\n(c)\nnet amounts for pay-floating/receive-fixed interest rate swaps for which net cash flows are exchanged;\n(d)\ncontractual amounts to be exchanged in a derivative financial instrument (eg a currency swap) for which gross cash flows are exchanged; and\n(e)\ngross loan commitments.\nSuch undiscounted cash flows differ from the amount included in the statement of financial position because the amount in that statement is based on discounted cash flows. When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. For example, when the amount payable varies with changes in an index, the amount disclosed may be based on the level of the index at the end of the period.\nB11E\nParagraph 39(c) requires an entity to describe how it manages the liquidity risk inherent in the items disclosed in the quantitative disclosures required in paragraph 39(a) and (b). An entity shall disclose a maturity analysis of financial assets it holds for managing liquidity risk (eg financial assets that are readily saleable or expected to generate cash inflows to meet cash outflows on financial liabilities), if that information is necessary to enable users of its financial statements to evaluate the nature and extent of liquidity risk.\nB11F\nOther factors that an entity might consider in providing the disclosure required in paragraph 39(c) include, but are not limited to, whether the entity:\n(a)\nhas committed borrowing facilities (eg commercial paper facilities) or other lines of credit (eg stand-by credit facilities) that it can access to meet liquidity needs;\n(b)\nholds deposits at central banks to meet liquidity needs;\n(c)\nhas very diverse funding sources;\n(d)\nhas significant concentrations of liquidity risk in either its assets or its funding sources;\n(e)\nhas internal control processes and contingency plans for managing liquidity risk;\n(f)\nhas instruments that include accelerated repayment terms (eg on the downgrade of the entity’s credit rating);\n(g)\nhas instruments that could require the posting of collateral (eg margin calls for derivatives);\n(h)\nhas instruments that allows the entity to choose whether it settles its financial liabilities by delivering cash (or another financial asset) or by delivering its own shares; or\n(i)\nhas instruments that are subject to master netting agreements.\nB12-B16\n[Deleted]\nAmendment to International Financial Reporting Standard 4\nInsurance Contracts\nParagraph 39(d) is amended.\nDISCLOSURE\nNature and extent of risks arising from insurance contracts\n39\n(d)\ninformation about credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk that paragraphs 31–42 of IFRS 7 would require if the insurance contracts were within the scope of IFRS 7. However:\n(i)\nan insurer need not provide the maturity analyses required by paragraph 39(a) and (b) of IFRS 7 if it discloses information about the estimated timing of the net cash outflows resulting from recognised insurance liabilities instead. This may take the form of an analysis, by estimated timing, of the amounts recognised in the statement of financial position.\n(ii)\n…'}]}"

of 25 May 2007
concerning the non-inclusion of fenitrothion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance
(notified under document number C(2007) 2164)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2007/379/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 703/2001 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes fenitrothion.
(3) For fenitrothion the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 703/2001 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 451/2000. For fenitrothion the rapporteur Member State was United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 4 November 2003.
(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group Evaluation and presented to the Commission on 13 January 2006 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fenitrothion (4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 14 July 2006 in the format of the Commission review report for fenitrothion.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns were identified. Based on the available information it has not been demonstrated that the estimated exposure of operators and workers is acceptable. Moreover, the estimated acute exposure of consumers cannot be regarded acceptable due to the insufficient information on the effects of certain degradation products that may be present in raw or processed commodities, and so it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that fentrothion met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing fenitrothion satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Fenitrothion should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing fenitrothion are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing fenitrothion, should be limited to twelve months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.
(10) This decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances (5).
(11) This decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for fenitrothion according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1429/95 (2) set implementing rules for export refunds on products processed from fruit and vegetables other than those granted for added sugar.
(2) Article 16(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 states that to the extent necessary to permit exportation of economically significant quantities export refunds can be granted on the products listed at Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation within the limits ensuing from agreements concluded in line with Article 300 of the Treaty. Article 18(4) of that Regulation provides that if the refund on the sugar incorporated in the products listed in Article 1(2)(b) is insufficient to allow exportation of these products the refund set in line with Article 17 thereof shall apply to them.
(3) Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that it be ensured that trade flows that have already arisen as a result of granting of export refunds are not disturbed. For that reason the quantities should be set product by product using the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3).
(4) Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 requires that when refunds are set account is taken of the existing situation and outlook for prices and availability on the Community market of products processed from fruit and vegetables and for international trade prices, of marketing and transport costs and of the economic aspects of the exportation envisaged.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the German Government has submitted to the Commission on 22 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the areas of  the western part of Berlin; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9  (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;

Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas certain measures planned under this Single Programming Document include the part-financing  of aid schemes which have not yet been approved by the Commission; whereas the financial  commitments should be reduced by the amounts corresponding to the said measures until the aid  schemes are approved by the Commission;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;

Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2702/1999(2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down general rules on the granting of aid for the production of olive oil and of aid to olive oil producer organisations(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1639/98(4), and in particular Article 17a(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the unit production aid must be reduced in each Member State where actual production exceeds the guaranteed national quantity referred to in paragraph 3 of that Article. In assessing the extent of the overrun in Spain, Greece and Portugal, account should be taken of the estimates for the production of table olives processed into olive oil, expressed as olive-oil equivalent using the relevant coefficients referred to in Commission Decisions 98/605/EC(5), 98/619/EC(6) and 98/620/EC(7).
(2) Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil that can be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be determined. That amount must be fixed at a level that avoids any risk of unwarranted payment to olive growers. The amount also applies to table olives, expressed as olive-oil equivalent. For the 1998/1999 marketing year, the estimated production and the unit amount of the production aid which can be paid in advance were fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2181/1999(8).
(3) Pursuant to Article 17(a)(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84, the actual production for which entitlement to aid is recognised must be determined no later than eight months after the end of the marketing year. To that end, in accordance with Article 14(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2366/98(9), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1273/1999(10), the Member States concerned must inform the Commission before 1 April following each marketing year of the quantity on which the aid is payable in each Member State. That information indicates that the quantity on which aid is payable for the 1998/1999 marketing year is 452286 tonnes for Italy, 2364 tonnes for France, 562493 tonnes for Greece, 899991 tonnes for Spain and 33936 tonnes for Portugal.
(4) Confirmation by the Member States that aid is payable on those quantities indicates that the controls referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 2261/84 and (EC) No 2366/98 have been carried out. However, the fixing of actual production on the basis of information from the Member States on the quantities on which aid is payable does not prejudge the conclusions which may be drawn from verification of the correctness of that information as part of the accounts clearance procedure.
(5) Taking account of the actual production figures, the unit amount of the production aid laid down in the second indent of Article 17(a)(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 payable on the eligible quantities of actual production should also be fixed.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Oils and Fats,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1642/2000 of 25 July 2000 fixing the actual production of olive oil and the unit amount of the production aid for the 1998/1999 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the 1994 Act of Accession, and in particular Article 150 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in accordance with Article 150 of the Act of Accession, the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, may make provision, under certain conditions, for national aid, corresponding at most to the difference  between the price recorded in a new Member State prior to accession and that resulting from the application of the Treaty of Accession, to be granted to private operators holding, on 1 January 1995, stocks of basic agricultural products or products  processed therefrom;
Whereas the abovementioned difference in prices may be observed in Austria and Finland only, prices in Sweden showing no difference with the common prices;
Whereas it emerges from Article 150 of the Act of Accession that, apart from specifying the maximum aid which may be granted and certain conditions covering the granting thereof, the Community measures contemplated should simply lay down a general  framework within which the two new Member States in question, which are to bear the financial liability thereof, will have full latitude to make their decisions;
Whereas, within the meaning of that Article, the product group concerned cover basic products and products processed therefrom; whereas, while live animals should be included, this Regulation should permit aid to be granted on any product which may be  in storage in the two new Member States referred to above on 1 January 1995;
Whereas the maximum aid on live animals and basic products must be equal to the fall in prices recorded in the Member States as a result of the application of the Treaty of Accession; whereas, however, those Member States should be permitted to  determine the period during which that fall has occurred and to make provision, with a view to simplification, for the maximum aid to be calculated on the basis of the institutional prices where such prices exist or have existed;
Whereas, in accordance with the general practice of the common agricultural policy, the maximum aid on processed products must be based as far as possible on the level laid down for the basic products; whereas, however, the difficulty in applying this  method in certain cases (and in particular where the basic product cannot be stocked or has no substantial impact on the prices of the processed products) means that the aid is to be calculated in those cases on the basis of the fall in prices for the  processed products themselves and therefore makes it appropriate to draw up a list specifying, for the most important agricultural sectors, the products on which the maximum aid is to be calculated for products derived therefrom; whereas, however,  provision should be made for the aid to be granted on other products too;
Whereas the new Member States should be free to consider as part of the compensation provided for by this Regulation payment of interest at a rate equal at most to the normal rate on the market in the new Member States in question for the period between  1 January 1995 and the date of payment of the aid;
Whereas the other conditions to be laid down must prevent any risk of overcompensation and of receipt in combination with other aid provided for in the Act of Accession and should rule out the granting of the aid on speculative stocks and products  imported into the new Member States prior to 1 January 1995 where the applicable import charges have not been paid;
Whereas, subject to the abovementioned limits and conditions, the new Member States should be allowed to lay down the detailed rules for the application of the arrangements, providing that the latter are submitted to the Commission under a procedure  reconciling the interests of suitable monitoring at Community level with the need for swift action in this area by the new Member States,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 3095/94 of 12 December 1994 on aid which Austria and Finland may grant on stocks held by private operations on 1 January 1995', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn order to offset, in full or in part, any fall in prices recorded as a result of the application of the Treaty of Accession, Austria and Finland may grant aid to private operators (producers, processors and traders) who, at 00.00 hours on 1  January 1995, own:\n\n(a) live animals covered by Chapter I of the CCT;\n\n(b) stocks of agricultural products listed in Annex I;\n\n(c) stocks of products derived from the products referred to in (b);\n\n(d) stocks of products listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty other than those referred to in (a), (b) or (c) and products processed therefrom.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission submitted after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters (hereinafter referred to as lighters) originating in Japan, the People's  Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand and falling within CN code ex 9613 10 00 (Taric code: 9613 10 00 * 10). The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 2832/91 (3), extended this duty for a period not exceeding two months.
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the interested parties who so requested were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views on the findings.
(3) Parties were informed in writing of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive duties and the definitive collection of amounts secured by way of a provisional duty. They  were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to the disclosure.
(4) The oral and written comments submitted by the parties were considered and, where appropriate, the Commission findings were modified to take account of them.
C. PRODUCT
(5) A number of exporters and one importer repeated the arguments put forward in the administrative procedure before the provisional measures, namely that the Community producers' lighters and the imported lighters are not like products, since certain  of the Community models produce more ignitions.
The Council, however, confirms the Commission's conclusions on this point, outlined in recital 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91, on which no new evidence was submitted.
The Council, therefore, confirms that the lighters produced and sold by the Community manufacturers, form one single category of product and constitute a product alike in all respects to the product imported from Japan, the People's Republic of China,  the Republic of Korea and Thailand within the meaning of Article 2 (12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
D. DUMPING
(6) The Thai producer and exporter, Thai Merry Co. Ltd, provided fresh evidence concerning the depreciation amount used by the Commission for the preliminary determination of normal value. In view of this evidence a new dumping calculation concerning  Thai Merry Co. Ltd has been made. Consequently, the dumping margin as a percentage of cif value, with regard to that undertaking, has been modified to 14,14 %.
(7) Given the fact that Thailand has been used as the analogue country for calculating normal value for China, the dumping margin for the People's Republic of China also required to be modified and is now 16,94 %.
(8) A Chinese exporter, Gladstrong Investments Ltd, which did not export to the Community during the reference period requested to be excluded from the application of the duty. Since the Commission was not in a position to make a determination with  regard to this exporter, this request could not be accepted by the Council. Nevertheless, the Council notes that the Commission is ready to initiate without delay a review whenever the exporting undertaking can show to the Commission, and supply to that  effect sufficient evidence, that it did not export during the investigation period, it started exporting or has the intention to export to the Community after the investigation period and that it is not related to or associated with any of the companies  subject to the present investigation for which dumping was found.
(9) With regard to Dong Guan Tian Bao Lighter Factory, another Chinese exporter, who submitted a reply to the questionnaire, which was, in any case, incomplete, more than six months after the deadline specified in the questionnaire sent by the  Commission services, it is considered that the dumping margin established for the People's Republic of China should apply.
(10) Gao Yao Co. submitted that the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports made by Gao Yao Co. should be cancelled and the normal value applicable to Gao Yao Co. calculated pursuant to Article 2 (6) and not Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
It was argued that Article 2 (5) should not be applied since imports to the Community were not made from the People's Republic China but from Hong Kong and that Gao Yao Co. (Hong Kong) should be considered as an exporter and not Gao Yao Co. (China).
The Council, however, confirms that in this case the products concerned were merely transhipped through Hong Kong and therefore the normal value should be determined in accordance with Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
(11) The exporters from Thailand argued that the profit margin of 8 %, added to the cost of production for the determination of the normal value, was too high. All domestic sales of Thai Merry Co. Ltd, were found to have been made at a loss, the  domestic sales of Politop Co. Ltd were not considered representative and there were no other producers or exporters in Thailand in the same business sector. Therefore, the Commission established a profit margin of 8 % on the basis of the profit realized  by other exporters from those countries which cooperated in this procedure.
(12) In the light of the above, the Council confirms the conclusions set out in recitals 19 to 29 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 taking into account the corrections mentioned above with regard to Thai Merry Co. Ltd and the consequent impact on the  margin established for the People's Republic of China.
The definitive weighted average margins expressed as a percentage of cif value for each of the exporters concerned are as follows:
Japan
Tokai Corporation, Yokohama 96,56 %,
People's Republic of China 16,94 %,
Republic of Korea
Samji Industrial, Inchon 31,58 %,
Thailand
Politop Co. Ltd, Bangkok 5,87 %,
Thai Merry Co. Ltd, Samutsakorn 14,14 %.
E. CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN INJURY AND DUMPING
(13) A certain number of exporters raised again the issue of price comparison of lighters at the resale level of the first independent buyer in the Community. It was argued that certain imported lighters contained less gas, produced less flame and,  therefore, had a different appeal to customers than those produced by the Community producers.
Recital 34 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 clearly indicates that the Commission excluded from the price undercutting exercise a number of lighters by taking into account only lighters with a similar gas content. The Council, therefore, confirms the  Commission findings with regard to price undercutting.
(14) No new evidence concerning injury was presented by any party. Consequently, the Council confirms the Commission conclusions on injury as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91.
(15) In recitals 44 to 50 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91, the Commission concluded that the cumulated dumped imports from Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand had caused material injury to the Community industry.
The Commission found that the rapid increase of Japanese, Chinese, Korean and Thai low-priced lighters coincided with an equally rapid decrease of production, capacity utilization, sales volume, market share, prices, profits and employment of the  Community industry.
No new facts or new arguments concerning these findings were submitted to the Commission after the publication of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91. The Council therefore confirms the conclusions of the Commission as set out in recitals 44 to 50 of that  Regulation.
F. INJURY THRESHOLD
(16) With regard to the calculation to determine the injury elimination level, the Commission considered it appropriate that the difference between actual selling prices of the exporters and a price which would allow the Community industry to achieve 15  % profit should be eliminated.
This 15 % profit margin has been contested by the Japanese producer and exporter as being too high.
(17) According to the Community producers, a 15 % profit margin is the minimum necessary to finance new investments in manufacturing facilities and research and development, without which the deterioration of the situation of the industry would be bound  to be exacerbated and the injury caused by dumping would not be entirely removed.
Consideration was given to the fact that the profit achieved by the major world producers has always ranged between 12 and 20 %.
In the light of the above, the Council confirms Commission findings with regard to the injury threshold as established in recital 59 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91.
G. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(18) The Japanese exporter suggested that there was a danger of Japanese imports being replaced by low-priced imports from other non-Community countries either from those involved in this procedure or others if a high anti-dumping duty was imposed  against Japan.
(19) The Council is not persuaded that the duties proposed would lead to Japanese imports being replaced by low-priced imports from other third countries and considers that even if it were to happen it would not be contrary to the Community's interest.  As the Council has already stated in previous Regulations, anti-dumping duties should neither have a protectionist effect for the Community industry nor cause any undue handicap for the exporters.
They are designed to re-establish fair and open market conditions by protecting the Community industry against an unfair trading practice. If some exporters' position on the market suffers after the imposition of anti-dumping duties, then this is only  the consequence of their inability to face a fair competitive market situation.
(20) The Council confirms the Commission findings set out in section G. of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 and considers that it is in the Community interest to impose anti-dumping measures to eliminate the injurious effects of dumped imports originating in  Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand.
H. DUTY
(21) On the basis of calculations of dumping and injury threshold described in Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91 and the submissions subsequently received, the Council concludes that duties should be imposed at the level of the actual dumping found for the  People's Republic of China and Thailand (firms Thai Merry Co. Ltd and Politop Co. Ltd) and for Japan (Tokai Corporation) and the Republic of Korea (Samji Industrial) on the basis of the injury threshold established.
The duties, therefore, shall be:
- Tokai Corporation, Japan 35,7 %,
- Samji Industrial, Republic of Korea 22,7 %,
- Gao Yao Co., People's Republic of China  16,9 %,
- Thai Merry Co. Ltd, Thailand 14,1 %,
- Politop Co. Ltd, Thailand 5,8 %.
(22) The Council confirms, for the reasons stated by the Commission in recital 60 of Regulation (EEC) No 1386/91, that the highest duty established for each country should be applied to firms which did not respond to the Commission questionnaire or  otherwise did not make themselves known to the Commission.
I. UNDERTAKING
(23) One of the two Thai exporters, Thai Merry Co. Ltd, has offered an undertaking which is considered acceptable. The undertaking will increase the price of the products in question to a level sufficient to eliminate the dumping established by the  Commission.
Following consultations during which one Member State raised objections to this solution, the undertaking was accepted by Commission Decision 91/604/EEC (4).
J. COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL DUTIES
(24) The Thai exporter, Thai Merry Co. Ltd, requested that lighter imports already dispatched before the date that provisional measures came into effect and customs cleared after that date be released free of collection of provisional duties and  consequently that the provisional duty should not be definitively collected in such cases.
(25) In accordance with Article 2 (1) and Article 11 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, anti-dumping duties are applied to the products concerned at the moment they enter into free circulation in the Community. Contrary to Council Regulation (EEC) No  288/82 of 5 February 1982 on common rules for imports (5), to which the exporter refers, Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, which is applicable to products imported under conditions of unfair competition, does not provide for any exceptions to this rule.  Moreover, it should be recalled that the Commission made considerable efforts to keep the parties concerned informed and thus the importers cannot reasonably claim to have been unaware of the proceedings or of the stage to which the investigation had  progressed during the period between the initiation of the proceedings and the imposition of the provisional duty.
(26) Therefore, in view of the size of the established dumping margins and of the serious nature of the injury caused to the Community industry, the Council considers it necessary that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty  should be collected definitively to the extent of the amount of the definitive duty imposed,","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EEC) No 3433/91 of 25 November 1991 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in Japan, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Thailand and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

of 8 May 2008
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 as regards the assessment of the active substance metalaxyl in the framework of Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection on the market (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Metalaxyl is one of the active substances listed in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2).
(2) As a consequence of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 18 July 2007 in Case C-326/05 P (3), which annulled Commission Decision 2003/308/EC (4) concerning the non-inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 1313/2007 of 8 November 2007 amending Regulations (EC) No 2076/2002 as regards the extension of the time period referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC with respect to metalaxyl and (EC) No 2024/2006 as regards the deletion of the derogation concerning metalaxyl (5).
(3) Article 233 of the Treaty requires the institution whose act has been declared void to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice. Further measures are thus necessary as regards Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 in particular with regard to the time limits for the submission of results of additional trials and additional information.
(4) Those further measures should be viewed against the unique factual situation of the judgment in case C-326/05 P. IQV had never lodged a complete dossier and wished instead to invoke studies lodged by another notifier. IQV claimed that it should only be required to add any further material not found in the latter’s dossier, which incidentally also contained gaps. IQV was however refused access to the dossier by the other notifier, who had withdrawn in the meantime. Throughout the proceedings, the Commission insisted that IQV bore the burden of proof of demonstrating that metalaxyl met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. This position was not contested by the Court. Since IQV did not have access to the other notifier’s dossier, the Commission took the view that the peer review could not be carried out successfully, since the peer review would raise questions about the studies contained in the other dossier. IQV, having been refused access to the dossier, would not be able to answer such questions. The rapporteur Member State submitted the Draft Assessment Report for the substance on 26 January 2001 on the basis of all the studies available at that time. However, during the evaluation, the data gaps that had been identified were of such nature that an inclusion of the substance in Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC could not be envisaged.
(5) During contacts with IQV on 17 September and 14 November 2007, the Commission informed IQV of its intention to complete the evaluation of the substance.
(6) The information on metalaxyl submitted to the Commission till to date is incomplete and does not allow an inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. The Commission is not in a position to guarantee that the studies and data that will be provided by IQV for the evaluation under Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 will be sufficient to fill the gaps identified and, thus, be sufficient to demonstrate that metalaxyl may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) The Commission and Member States will take a pragmatic approach to rely as much as legally possible on the already existing data. It is common that during the peer review questions are brought forward. These questions could be raised on all elements of the dossier, and it is IQV’s sole responsibility to address them should this situation occur.
(8) To complete the assessment of metalaxyl by the date laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2076/2002, it is essential that strict deadlines are applied in the different steps of the procedure. Therefore, it can not be assumed that any gaps identified later in the dossier can be remedied by providing further studies as this would delay the assessment.
(9) To allow metalaxyl to be examined, certain time periods provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 should be adapted.
(10) Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '9.5.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 416/2008\nof 8 May 2008\namending Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 as regards the assessment of the active substance metalaxyl in the framework of Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Metalaxyl is one of the active substances listed in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(2).\n\n((2)) As a consequence of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 18 July 2007 in Case C-326/05 P(3), which annulled Commission Decision 2003/308/EC(4)concerning the non-inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 1313/2007 of 8 November 2007 amending Regulations (EC) No 2076/2002 as regards the extension of the time period referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC with respect to metalaxyl and (EC) No 2024/2006 as regards the deletion of the derogation concerning metalaxyl(5).\n\n((3)) Article 233 of the Treaty requires the institution whose act has been declared void to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice.

of 30 June 2000
amending Directive 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions for products subject to excise duties brought into Sweden from other Member States
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(1),
Having regard to the consultation of the Economic and Social Committee,
Whereas:
(1) Article 26(3) of Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products(2) subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products grants Sweden the right to continue to apply, until 30 June 2000, the same restrictions as laid down in the 1994 Act of Accession of Sweden on the quantity of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, which may be brought into Swedish territory without further excise duty payment by private individuals for their own use.
(2) This derogation was granted because in a Europe without frontiers where excise rates vary widely, an immediate, total removal of excise limitations would have caused an unacceptable diversion of trade and revenue and distortion of competition in Sweden, which has traditionally applied high excise duties to the products concerned both as an important source of revenue and for health and social reasons.
(3) Finland and Denmark have been authorised to apply similar restrictions until 31 December 2003.
(4) Sweden has requested authorisation to continue to apply such restrictions for the same period as Finland and Denmark, as it needs more time to adjust its alcohol policy to a situation without restrictions.
(5) At the same time, Sweden undertakes to raise the current quantitative limits for alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought into Swedish territory from other Member States in several steps in order for it to align gradually with the Community rules laid down in Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 92/12/EEC and to ensure a complete removal of intra-Community restrictions for these products by 31 December 2003.
(6) Article 26 of Directive 92/12/EEC represents a derogation from one of the fundamental principles of the internal market, namely the right of its citizens to transport goods purchased for their own use throughout the Community without incurring liability to new duty charges, so it is necessary to limit its effects as far as possible.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to provide further time for adjustment in Sweden by extending the deadline laid down in Article 26(3) of Directive 92/12/EEC for a non-renewable period until 31 December 2003 and to fix the steps of the gradual liberalisation of the restrictions prior to their complete removal at that date.
(8) Having regard to the economic importance of this Directive it is necessary to invoke the ground of urgency referred to in point I(3) of the Protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam on the role of national parliaments in the European Union,","{'title': 'Council Directive 2000/44/EC of 30 June 2000 amending Directive 92/12/EEC as regards temporary quantitative restrictions for products subject to excise duties brought into Sweden from other Member States', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDirective 92/12/EEC is amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas, on 17 November 1986, the Council adopted Directive 86/566/EEC amending the First Directive of 11 May 1960 for the implementation of Article 67 of the Treaty (3); whereas, as a consequence, the number of cross-border applications for admission to listing is likely to increase;
Whereas Article 24 of Directive 80/390/EEC (4), as amended by Directive 82/148/EEC (5), provides that, where securities are to be admitted to official listing on stock exchanges in two or more Member States, the competent authorities of such Member States are to cooperate and endeavour to agree a single text for the listing particulars for use in all the Member States concerned;
Whereas that provision does not result in the full mutual recognition of listing particulars and it is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 80/390/EEC so as to achieve that recognition;
Whereas mutual recognition represents an important step forward in the creation of the Community's internal market;
Whereas, in this connection, it is necessary to specify which authorities are competent to check and approve listing particulars in the event of simultaneous applications for admission to official listing in two or more Member States;
Whereas mutual recognition can be effective only in so far as Directive 80/390/EEC and the Directives to which it refers have been incorporated in the national legislation of the Member State the competent authorities of which approve the listing particulars;
Whereas the mutual recognition of listing particulars does not in itself confer a right to admission;
Whereas it is advisable to provide for the extension, by means of agreements to be concluded by the Community with non-member countries, of the recognition of listing particulars from those countries on a reciprocal basis;
Whereas provision should be made for a transitional period for the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to take account of the periods accorded to those Member States under Article 2 (2) of Directive 86/566/EEC,","{'title': 'Council Directive 87/345/EEC of 22 June 1987 amending Directive 80/390/EEC coordinating the requirements for the drawing-up, scrutiny and distribution of the listing particulars to be published for the admission of securities to official stock exchange listing', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nSection IV of Directive 80/390/EEC is replaced by the following Sections and Sections V and VI shall become Sections VIII and IX, respectively:\n\n'SECTION IV\n\nDetermination of the competent authority""}, {'id': '24', 'title': 'Article 24', 'text': ""Article 24\n\nWhere, for the same securities, applications for admission to official listing on stock exchanges situated or operating in two or more Member States, including the Member State in which the issuer's registered office is situated, are made simultaneously or within a short interval, listing particulars shall be drawn up in accordance with the rules laid down in this Directive in the Member State in which the issuer has its registered office and approved by the competent authorities of that State; if the issuer's registered office is not situated in one of those Member States, the issuer must choose one of those States under the legislation of which the listing particulars will be drawn up and approved.\n\nSECTION V\n\nMutual recognition""}, {'id': '24', 'title': 'Article 24a', 'text': 'Article 24a\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and amending Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1), and in particular Article 14 in conjunction with Article 17 thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) The maximum residue limit (‘MRL’) for pharmacologically active substances intended for use in the Union in veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals or in biocidal products used in animal husbandry should be established in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 470/2009.
(2) Pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding MRLs in foodstuffs of animal origin are set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 of 22 December 2009 on pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding maximum residue limits in foodstuffs of animal origin (2).
(3) Fenbendazole is currently included in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 as an allowed substance, for all ruminants, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk, and for porcine and equidae species applicable to muscle, fat, liver and kidney.
(4) An application for the extension of the existing entry for fenbendazole to include chicken has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.
(5) According to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 470/2009 the European Medicines Agency is to consider using MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in a particular foodstuff for another foodstuff derived from the same species, or MRLs established for a pharmacologically active substance in one or more species for other species. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use CVMP recommended the extrapolation of the MRLs for fenbendazole from all ruminants, porcine and equidae species to all food-producing species except fin fish, applicable to muscle, fat, liver, kidney, milk and eggs.
(6) The entry for fenbendazole in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include all food-producing species except fin fish, and the target tissue eggs.
(7) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas table grapes are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas table grapes harvested during a given crop year are marketed from May to April of the next year; whereas the quantities harvested in May and June, during the first 20 days of July and also January to April of the next year are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these periods; whereas, due principally to developments in production techniques, a relatively large increase in the marketing of Community products during the last 10 days of November and in the month of December can be expected; whereas, however, the figures at present available are insufficiently conclusive to justify fixing a reference price for that period; whereas, reference prices should be fixed only for the period 21 July to 20 November inclusive;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be disregarded;
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 272 (3) of the Act of Accession, the prices of Portuguese products will not be used for the purpose of calculating reference prices, during the first stage of accession;

(5) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (hereinafter ‘CVMP’) has established an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for salicylic acid, the marker residue for sodium salicylate, at 0,38 mg/person or 0,0063 mg/kg bodyweight by using and adjusting data available for the related substance acetyl salicylate.
(6) Based on residue depletion within 24 hours of sodium salicylate in turkeys treated with the substance, the CVMP recommends in its opinion of 13 January 2010 provisional MRLs for muscle, skin, fat, liver and kidney of turkeys. Those provisional MRLs represent 96 % of the maximum daily intake of residues contained in food obtained from turkey.
(7) Since the relevant data on depletion of sodium salicylate in eggs are not available, the CVMP could not evaluate the safety of substance in eggs. Sodium salicylate should therefore not be used in animals producing eggs for human consumption.
(8) The entry for sodium salicylate in Table 1 of the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the recommended provisional MRLs for sodium salicylate for turkey while excluding the use of the substance in animals producing eggs for human consumption. The provisional MRL set out in that Table for sodium salicylate should expire on 1 January 2015.
(9) It is appropriate to provide for a reasonable period of time for the stakeholders concerned to take measures that may be required to comply with the newly set MRL.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included dichlobenil.
(2) In accordance with Article 11f of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 and Article 12(1)(a) and Article 12(2)(b) of that Regulation, Commission Decision 2008/754/EC of 18 September 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of dichlobenil in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance (4) was adopted.
(3) The original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(4) The application was submitted to the United Kingdom, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/754/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) The United Kingdom evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 7 October 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on dichlobenil to the Commission on 29 July 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 11 March 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for dichlobenil.
(6) The additional report by the rapporteur Member State and the conclusion by the Authority concentrate on the concerns that lead to the non-inclusion; in particular, there was a concern with regard to the consumer exposure from drinking water and the leaching to groundwater. More concerns were identified in the review report for dichlobenil.
(7) Additional information was submitted by the applicant, in particular as regards the leaching to groundwater, the consumer exposure from drinking water, the risks to birds and mammals and methods of analysis for impurities in the technical material and for products of animal origin.
(8) However, the additional information provided by the applicant did not permit to eliminate all of the specific concerns arising in respect of dichlobenil.
(9) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. Several unacceptable effects on the environment were identified. In particular, the potential groundwater contamination by the very persistent metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) is expected to be very high, with concentrations well above 10 μg/l for all modelled scenarios. There is a potential for long-range transport of the metabolite BAM through the atmosphere. A high acute risk to birds and a high long-term risk to earthworm-eating birds and mammals were identified. The available data were insufficient to address the nature of residues of the metabolite BAM in processed commodities.
(10) The Commission invited the applicant to submit its comments on the conclusion by the Authority. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 21(1) to Regulation (EC) No 33/2008, the Commission invited the applicant to submit comments on the draft review report. The applicant submitted its comments, which have been carefully examined.
(11) However, despite the arguments put forward by the applicant, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the expert meetings of the Authority have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing dichlobenil satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(12) Dichlobenil should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(13) In the interest of clarity, Decision 2008/754/EC should be repealed.
(14) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of a further application for dichlobenil pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(15) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '13.4.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 98/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 11 April 2011\nconcerning the non-inclusion of dichlobenil in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC\n(notified under document C(2011) 2437)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/234/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

(5) The lists of semen collection and storage centres from which Member States shall authorise the importation of semen originating in third countries is established and updated in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 88/407/EEC which foresees that the up-to-date version of all lists be made available to the public. These lists are on the Internet at: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/index_en.htm.
(6) Directive 2003/43/EC amending Directive 88/407/EEC provides that as of 1 January 2005, semen of domestic animals of bovine species must be collected, processed and stored according to the new provisions introduced by Directive 2003/43/EC in order to be eligible to imports.
(7) However, it is appropriate to authorise the continuing imports of stocks of semen of domestic animals of bovine species in accordance with the provisions of Directive 88/407/EEC, prior to the modification introduced by Directive 2003/43/EC.
(8) Therefore, Article 2(2) of Directive 2003/43/EC provides that:
— up until 31 December 2004, Member States shall authorise imports of semen of domestic animals of bovine species collected, processed, stored before 31 December 2004 and accompanied by a certificate in accordance with the models provided for before the amendments introduced by Directive 2003/43/EC,
— after this date, Member States shall not authorise imports of semen of domestic animals of bovine species in accordance with the provisions formerly in force unless it was collected, processed and stored before 31 December 2004.
(9) Consequently, it is necessary to provide a model certificate for imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species collected, processed and stored before 31 December 2004 and to be used as of 1 January 2005.
(10) It is more convenient to gather, in the same act, all the information relating to the importation of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species (list of third countries authorised, veterinary requirements applying to importations and list of centres approved in those third countries), and to repeal Decisions 90/14/EEC, 91/277/EEC and 94/577/EC accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104c (12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas the second stage for achieving economic and monetary union started on 1 January 1994; whereas Article 109e (4) of the Treaty lays down that, in the second stage, Member States shall endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits;
Whereas there is an excessive deficit procedure which provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit and, after the excessive deficit has been corrected, for the abrogation of that decision; whereas, in the second stage, the excessive deficit procedure is determined by Article 104c, excluding paragraphs 1, 9 and 11, of the Treaty; whereas the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of that procedure; whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the said Protocol;
Whereas, following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104c (6) of the Treaty, the Council decided, on 26 September 1994, that an excessive deficit existed in Denmark; whereas, in accordance with Article 104c (7), the Council made recommendations to Denmark, on 7 November 1994 and 24 July 1995, with a view to bringing the excessive situation to an end;
Whereas a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated, in accordance with the provisions of Article 104c (12) of the Treaty, when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected;
Whereas, when abrogating the Decision, the Council is to act on a recommendation from the Commission; whereas, based on the data provided by the Commission, after reporting by Denmark by March 1996 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 3605/93, the following conclusions are warranted:
The temporary widening of the government deficit in 1993 has since been reversed. The Danish general Government net borrowing decreased in 1994 and 1995, reaching 1,4 % of GDP in 1995, a level well below the Treaty reference value. It is expected to decline further in 1996;
A reduction in the gross debt ratio was achieved in 1994 and 1995, when the ratio was reduced from 80,1 % of GDP to 71,9 % of GDP. The evolution of the gross debt ratio, in particular its earlier increase, has been heavily influenced by special institutional features, which accounted for some 19 percent of GDP in 1995;
The deficit is now well below the Treaty reference value, and should remain so in the medium term, and the gross debt ratio has declined sharply for two consecutive years and is expected to decline markedly further,","{'title': '96/420/EC: Council Decision of 27 June 1996 abrogating the decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in Denmark', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom an overall assessment, it follows that the excessive deficit situation in Denmark has been corrected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Council Decision of 26 September 1994 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Denmark is hereby abrogated.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 27 June 1996.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

of 22 March 1984
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain electronic scales originating in Japan
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79 of 30 December 1979 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1580/82 (2), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) On 6 April 1983 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the European Committee of Weighing Instrument Manufacturers (CECIP) on behalf of producers accounting for about 80 % of Community production of electronic scales. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of scales for use in the retail trade which incorporate a digital display of the weight, unit price and price to be paid and sometimes a printout of these three functions, and are commonly referred to as electronic scales falling within heading No ex 84.20 of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 84.20-81 and originating in Japan. The Commission then commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants, and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing. All the known exporters and most importers made their views known in writing and some of them requested and were granted hearings.
(3) For the purpose of a preliminary determination the Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from complainant Community producers, exporters and importers. The information received was also checked by means inter alia of investigations carried out at the premises of Community producers and Japanese producers and/or exporters, including W & T Avery Ltd, Ishida Scales Manufacturing Co. Ltd, Kubota Ltd, Teraoka Seikosno Co. Ltd, Tokyo Electric Co. Ltd, Yamato Scales Co. Ltd and C. Itoh Electronics Ltd.
(4) The investigations revealed that the complainants Berkel GmbH and Alfred Herbert & Sons Ltd had links with the Japanese exporters of the products in question and had consequently, by virtue of Article 4 (5) of the abovementioned Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79, to be deleted from the list of complainants in the proceeding in hand. In the light of this, complainant Community producers represent 72 % of the Community's production of electronic scales.
(5) The investigation of dumping covered the period September 1982 to August 1983.
B. Normal value
(6) For imports of all scales from Kubota and Ishida and some Yamato and Teraoka models, normal value was provisionally determined on the basis of the actual prices of domestic sales in Japan. For Kubota the domestic selling prices were adjusted to take account of the fact that the goods had been sold at a loss, the adjustment being equivalent to the loss plus an 8 % profit margin, which was considered reasonable in the light of the
performance of Japanese manufacturers of scales over the past three years.
(7) For imports of other Yamato and Teraoka models and all scales from Tokyo Electric Co., normal value was provisionally determined on the basis of production costs and overheads plus a reasonable margin of 8 %, determined as indicated above. The use of a constructed value was justified either, as in the case of Yamato, Teraoka and some Tokyo Electric Co. models, by the absence of any like product or, as in the case of two other models exported by Tokyo Electric Co., by the fact that there had been no sales of like products on the Japanese domestic market in the ordinary course of trade.
C. Export prices
(8) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community. However, where exports were made to associated companies or subsidiaries in the Community, export prices were constructed on the basis of the prices at which the imported product was first resold to an independent buyer, suitably adjusted to take account of all costs incurred between importation and resale, including customs duty, and of a profit margin of 8 %, which was considered reasonable in the light of the profit margins of independent importers of the products concerned. In particular, the products of Kubota Ltd are exported to the Community by a Japanese firm, C. Itoh Electronics Ltd, and the export prices taken into consideration were the latter's.
(9) Several Japanese exporters pointed out that, since the export price and the normal value were not on a comparable basis, appropriate allowances should be made in accordance with Article 2 (10) of Regulation (EEC) No 3017/79, which provides for consideration of differences affecting price comparability.
Accordingly, adjustments were made to take account where appropriate of differences in payment terms, levels of trade and technical characteristics affecting price comparability, where such differences could be satisfactorily established.
D. Margins
(10) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping by all exporters involved, the dumping margin being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. These margins vary according to the exporter, the importing Member State and the type of electronic scales concerned, the weighted average margin for each of the exporters investigated being as follows:
- C. Itoh Electronics Ltd (exporter of scales manufactured by Kubota Ltd): 51,88 ECU,
- Yamato Scale Co. Ltd: 16,50 ECU,
- Ishida Scales Manufacturing Co. Ltd: 10,56 ECU,
- Teraoka Seikosno Co. Ltd: 34,27 ECU,
- Tokyo Electric Co. Ltd: 21,05 ECU.
E. Injury
(11) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports of electronic scales from Japan rose steeply from 4 167 units in 1980 to 8 315 units in 1982. The investigation also showed that total recorded Japanese exports of these products to the Community from September 1982 to August 1983 reached 9 445 units, with a consequent increase in the share of the Community market held by Japanese imports from 6,01 % in 1980 to 10,05 % in 1982. Moreover, it has been noted that the resale prices on the Community market of certain Japanese weighing scales have undercut by more than 50 % the selling prices of like products manufactured by the Community industry.
(12) The Community industry in respect of which the impact of the dumped imports must be assessed consists of the European manufacturers of electronic scales.
(13) For the Community industry, the main effects of the dumping have been price depression reaching 10 % in certain instances, a fall in employment by more than 700 units since 1980, and the achievement of profit levels below those necessary to enable this advanced technology sector to undertake the investment needed to improve productivity and develop its products. (14) The Commission considered whether injury had been caused by other factors such as the volume and prices of other imports or the trend of demand. Imports into the Community from all origins other than Japan fell from 4 581 to 1 704 units between 1980 and 1982. Consumption in the Community increased during the same period. It was, however, established that the reduction in imports from other sources had benefited the dumped imports more than Community production.
(15) Therefore the sharp increase in the dumped imports and the prices at which they are offered for resale in the Community led the Commission to find that the effects of the dumped imports of certain electronic scales originating in Japan must be regarded as a cause of material injury to the Community industry concerned.
F. Community interest
(16) After having considered both the interests of the Community and the dumping and the injury provisionally established, the Commission has come to the conclusion that action should be taken. In order to prevent further injury being caused during the remainder of the proceeding, this action should take the form of the remainder of the proceeding, this action should take the form of a provisional anti-dumping duty.
G. Rate of duty
(17) Having regard to the extent of injury caused, the duty should in all cases correspond to the margin of dumping provisionally determined. In the case of products fromJapanese exporters not known to the Commission, it should correspond to the highest such margin recorded.
(18) A period should be fixed within which the parties concerned may make their views known and request an oral hearing,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 757/84 of 22 March 1984 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of certain electronic scales originating in Japan', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (2) applies to import licences for tariff quota periods starting from 1 January 2007.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 lays down in particular detailed rules for applications for import licences, the status of applicants and the issue of licences. It limits the period of validity of import licences to the final day of the tariff quota period.
(3) Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 2375/2002 of 27 December 2002 opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for common wheat of a quality other than high quality from third countries (3), 2377/2002 of 27 December 2002 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for malting barley from third countries (4), 2305/2003 of 29 December 2003 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for imports of barley from third countries (5), and 969/2006 of 29 June 2006 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for imports of maize from third countries (6) contain provisions which diverge from the common rules laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006. Those regulations should therefore be amended with a view to removing the differing rules, specifying the serial numbers of each quota and subquota and redefining where necessary the specific rules which apply, in particular to the drawing up of licence applications, their issue, their period of validity and the notification of information to the Commission.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. In particular, in order to ensure fluid supply to the Community market, the intervals at which applications are to be submitted provided for in Regulations (EC) Nos 2375/2002, 2377/2002, 2305/2003 and 969/2006 should be maintained, and it is therefore necessary to derogate from Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 on this point. Likewise, in order to guarantee equal access to operators, the penalty in the event of submission of multiple applications should be maintained.
(5) In the interests of simplifying the above regulations, provisions which are already contained in the horizontal or sectoral implementing regulations, that is, apart from Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006, Commission Regulations (EC) Nos 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), and 1342/2003 of 28 July 2003 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice (8), should be deleted, as should provisions which no longer apply.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas extension of tacit renewal beyond the end of the transitional period was last authorized in the case of the Agreements and Protocols listed in the Annex by Decision 84/88/EEC (2);
Whereas the Member States concerned have, with a view to avoiding any disruption of their commercial relations with the third countries concerned based on agreement, requested authorization to extend or renew the abovementioned agreements;
Whereas, however, most of the areas covered by these national agreements are henceforth the subject of Community agreements; whereas in this situation there should be authorization for the maintenance of national agreements only for those areas not covered by Community agreements; whereas, in addition, such authorization should not, therefore, adversely affect the obligation incumbent upon the Member States to avoid and, where appropriate, to eliminate any incompatibility between such agreements and the provisions of Community law;
Whereas the provisions of the agreements to be either prolonged or renewed should not furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas the Member States concerned have declared that the extension or tacit renewal of these agreements would neither constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community negotiations with the third countries concerned and the transfer of the commercial substance of those agreements to Community agreements nor, during the period under consideration, hinder the adoption of the measures necessary to complete the standardization of the import arrangements of the Member States;
Whereas at the conclusion of the consultations provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC it was established, as the aforesaid declarations by the Member States concerned confirm, that the provisions of the agreements to be extended or renewed would not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;

Having regard to the requests submitted by 12 Member States,
Whereas:
(1) Production of reproductive material of the species set out in the Annexes is at present insufficient in certain Member States with the result that their requirements for reproductive material conforming to the provisions of Directive 66/404/EEC or 71/161/EEC cannot be met.
(2) Third countries are not in a position to supply sufficient reproductive material of the relevant species affording the same guarantees as Community reproductive material and conforming to the provisions of Directive 66/404/EEC or 71/161/EEC.
(3) Accordingly, the Member States concerned, namely Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and the United Kingdom, have requested the Commission pursuant to those Directives to authorise them to accept for marketing reproductive material and/or seed satisfying less stringent requirements than those laid down by those Directives.
(4) In order to cover the shortage, the applicant Member States should therefore be authorised to permit, for a limited period, the marketing of reproductive material of the relevant species which satisfies less stringent requirements.
(5) For genetic reasons, the reproductive material should be collected at places of origin within the natural range of the relevant species and the strictest possible guarantees should be given to ensure the identity of the material. Furthermore, reproductive material should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question.
(6) Any Member State should furthermore be authorised to permit, in its territory, the following three marketing operations: the marketing of seed and seedlings which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of provenance; the marketing of seed and seedlings which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of the category, as laid down in Directive 66/404/EEC for Populus nigra; and the marketing of seed which satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of specific purity as laid down in Directive 71/161/EEC, if the marketing of such material has been authorised in the other Member States under this Decision.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, the number of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats originating in the Communiy and qualifying for aid with a view to developing production potential in the Azores and Madeira should be determined for each annual period of application.
(2) The aid referred to above for the supply of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats originating in the rest of the Community to the Azores and Madeira should be fixed. That aid must be fixed in the light, in particular, of the costs of supply from the Community market and the conditions resulting from the geographical situation of the Azores and Madeira.
(3) Common detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for the supply of certain agricultural products to the Azores and Madeira are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1696/92(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2757/98(4). Additional detailed rules should be laid down in line with current commercial practice in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector, in particular as regards the term of validity of aid certificates and the securities ensuring operators' compliance with their obligations.
(4) With a view to sound administration of the supply arrangements, a timetable should be laid down for the lodging of certificate applications and for a period of reflection for their issue.
(5) This Regulation will enter into force after the expiry of the time limit for submitting licence applications in January 2001. To avoid a break in supplies to the Azores and Madeira, provision should be made to derogate from Article 4(1) and (2) of this Regulation and to allow, for that month alone, the submission of licence applications in the five working days following the entry into force of this Regulation and to set the time limit for the issue of such licences at 10 working days following the entry into force of this Regulation.
(6) With a view to bringing the administration of the aid more closely into line with the requirements of the Azores and Madeira, the aid and the quantities to which the latter may apply should be fixed annually per calendar year.

Having regard to Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community(1), and in particular Articles 1 and 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Decision No 2119/98/EC, a network at Community level is to be set up to promote cooperation and coordination between the Member States, with the assistance of the Commission, with a view to improving the prevention and control, in the Community, of the categories of communicable diseases specified in the Annex to that Decision. That network is to be used for the epidemiological surveillance of those diseases and for the establishment of an early warning and response system;
(2) The diseases and special health issues to be covered by the early warning and response system at Community level should reflect the present needs in the Community, in particular the added value of reaction at Community level;
(3) The early warning and response system must address the issues raised by the competent public health authorities in each Member State or evidenced by data collected under Article 4 of Decision No 2119/98/EC;
(4) This Decision should facilitate the integration of the Community network set up under Decision No 2119/98/EC with other rapid alert networks set up at national or Community level for diseases and special issues to be covered by the early warning and response system. For the purpose of its implementation, the Community network should therefore operate by using in the first instance the Health Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases within the European Public Health Information Network (EUPHIN-HSSCD), consisting of three components:
(a) an early warning and response system for reports of specified threats to the public transmitted by the competent public health authorities of each Member State responsible for determining measures which may be required to protect public health;
(b) exchange of information between accredited structures and authorities of the Member States relevant to public health;
(c) specific networks on diseases selected for epidemiological surveillance between accredited structures and authorities of the Member States;
(5) The development of new useful technologies should be monitored on a regular basis and taken into consideration for the importation of the EUPHIN-HSSCD as the operating system.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/28/EC(2), and in particular Article 16(3) thereof,
Having regard to the communication made by Austria on 2 August 2001,
Whereas:
(1) Following the detection of the harmful organism Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) for the first time in the European Union in 1999, Commission Decision 1999/355/EC(3) as amended by Decision 1999/516/EC(4) established emergency measures against the dissemination of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) as regards China (except Hong Kong).
(2) Following detection of this harmful organism for the first time in the European Union on trees of Acer platanoides in Braunau in the Bundesland Oberösterreich, Austria implemented a programme of action in accordance with Article 16(2) of Directive 2000/29/EC to control its introduction into and the spread within Austria and the territory of the Community.
(3) The measures adopted by Austria were more stringent than those provided for in Decision 1999/355/EC in that they applied to imports of susceptible hardwood originating in Korea, Taiwan and the United States of America, as well as to wood from China. Further, they provided that the wood to be imported must be both stripped of its bark and free of insect bore holes greater than 3 mm across and kiln dried to below 20 % moisture content. By contrast Decision 1999/355/EC requires either that the wood be stripped of bark and free of insect bore holes, or that it be kiln dried to below 20 % moisture content.
(4) The Austrian measures did not however apply to wood of Fagus silvatica and Quercus L.
(5) Austria has justified these measures by the need to protect itself and the territory of the Community because Austria ""... thinks that a strengthening of the current Community measures carried out according to Decisions 1999/355/EC and 1999/516/EC on emergency measures against the dissemination of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) as regards China (except Hong Kong) would be reasonable ..."".
(6) It has not yet been possible to identify the source of contamination, although elements indicate that the import of packaging material infected by Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) is the most likely pathway, nor is there in this case sufficient evidence yet to suggest that the said Community measures are insufficient.
(7) Austria should therefore adjust the measures which it has adopted with a view to protecting itself and the territory of the Community against the introduction of the said harmful organism.
(8) The measures provided for in Decision 1999/355/EC and in Directive 2000/29/EC will be reviewed in the light of the FAO International Standard on ""Guidelines for regulating wood packaging material in international trade"".
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'title': '2002/360/EC: Commission Decision of 13 May 2002 establishing the amendments to be made to the measures taken by Austria to protect itself against the introduction of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (notified under document number C(2002) 1821)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAustria shall adjust the measures which it has adopted with a view to protecting itself and the territory of the Community against the introduction and spread of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) in such a manner that the measures comply with Decision 1999/355/EC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Austria.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 May 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 169, 10.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 77, 20.3.2002, p. 23.\n\n(3) OJ L 137, 1.6.1999, p. 45.\n\n(4) OJ L 197, 29.7.1999, p. 44.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 (2) and (EC) No 2229/2004 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes the substances added in the Annex to this Decision.
(3) Within two months from receipt of the draft assessment report the notifiers concerned voluntarily withdrew, in accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, their support for the inclusion of those substances.
(4) The Commission has examined the draft assessment reports, the recommendations from the rapporteur Member States and the comments from other Member States and has come to the conclusion that Articles 24b and 24f do not apply. Consequently, Article 24e applies.
(5) The substances listed in the Annex to this Decision should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) As the non-inclusion of these substances is not based on the presence of clear indications of harmful effects as laid down in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004, Member States should have the possibility to maintain authorisations until 31 December 2010, in accordance with Article 25(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004.
(7) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing the listed substances should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season.
(8) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of a new application under Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (4) in accordance with the accelerated procedure provided for in Articles 13 to 22 of that Regulation.
(9) Articles 13 to 22 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 provide for an accelerated procedure for such new application. That procedure allows notifiers whose substance has not been included based on their withdrawal, to make a new application in accordance with the accelerated procedure set out in Regulation (EC) No 33/2008. When submitting the new application under this procedure notifiers are allowed to submit only the additional data necessary to address the specific issues for which a need for further information was identified during the risk assessment.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC (2), and in particular Article 10 (4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (3), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC, and in particular Article 9 (4) thereof,
Whereas according to the second subparagraph of Article 9 (1) of Directive 89/662/EEC and the second subparagraph of Article 10 (1) of Directive 90/425/EEC, the Member State of origin shall implement on its territory the appropriate measures to prevent all situations which may constitute a serious hazard to animals or to human health;
Whereas, to protect animal and human health in the Community, the Commission adopted Decision 94/474/EC of 27 July 1994 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and repealing Decisions 89/469/EEC and 90/200/EEC (4), as last amended by Decision 95/287/EC (5), Decision 92/290/EEC of 14 May 1992 concerning certain protection measures relating to bovine embryos in respect of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in the United Kingdom (6), as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, Decision 94/381/EC of 27 June 1994 concerning certain protection measures with regard to bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the feeding of mammalian derived protein (7), as amended by Decision 95/60/EC (8), Decision 94/382/EC of 27 June 1994 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste of ruminant origin, with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (9), as amended by Decision 95/29/EC (10), Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (11), as amended by Decision 96/362/EC (12) and Decision 96/449/EC of 18 July 1996 on the approval of alternative heat treatment systems for processing animal waste with a view to the inactivation of spongiform encephalopathy agents (13);
Whereas upon the publication in March 1996 of new information on certain cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease where the link to BSE could not be ruled out, Community institutions have recognized that decisive action must be taken in order to control and finally eradicate BSE;
Whereas Ireland has had cases of BSE in its native cattle;
Whereas in order to control BSE, Decision 96/449/EC will require from 1 April 1997 that animal waste is processed in a system which achieves a minimum of 133 Â°C at 3 bars for 20 minutes; whereas in addition the Scientific Veterinary Committee has recommended that specified risk material (SRM), which are defined as:
(a) the skull, including the brain and eyes but excluding the tongue, and spinal cord of:
- bovine animals aged over 12 months,
- ovine and caprine animals aged over 12 months or which have a permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum;
(b) the spleen of animals of the ovine and caprine species;
should be excluded from the food and feed chains;
Whereas, in November 1996, Ireland presented to the Commission a plan laying down supplementary measures to control and eradicate BSE in Ireland, hereafter referred to as 'the plan`, whereas Ireland has, on 24 February 1997, presented an amended version of the plan;
Whereas the principal elements of the plan are:
(a) compulsory slaughter and destruction of suspect cases of BSE and, if confirmed, slaughter and destruction of all animals in herds where cases of BSE have occurred;
(b) identification and slaughter of animals exposed to the same risks as the affected animals;
(c) measures to exclude SRM from the food and feed chains;
(d) prohibition on the use of meat-and-bone meal containing SRM and recall of existing stocks.
Whereas a programme to control BSE and reduce the number of future cases should concentrate on removal of animals most likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal in accordance with the principle laid down in point 6 of the conclusions of the Council meeting on 1 to 3 April 1996;
Whereas the Council concluded that such an option should be open to Member States other than the United Kingdom on a case-by-case basis;
Whereas the Irish authorities will carry out a full epidemiological inquiry on each case of BSE in order to identify other animals likely to have been exposed to infected meat-and-bone meal and will slaughter such animals and destroy the carcases; this inquiry will include animals which may have been moved to other holdings;
Whereas consequently the Commission can accept that the Irish programme for the eradication of BSE can be financed with a Community contribution on the basis of the same principles and in accordance with the same procedure as laid down in points 8 and 9 of the conclusions of the Council meeting of 1 to 3 April 1996;
Whereas the Commission, in accordance with point 9 of those Council conclusions, has adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 716/96 (14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2423/96 (15) and Regulation (EC) No 717/96 (16) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (17) in order to provide market support;
Whereas a similar measure will be proposed for financial assistance to Ireland for the present plan;
Whereas the plan presented on 13 November 1996, as amended on 24 February 1997, will contribute to a reduction in the number of BSE cases and increase the controls relating to the disease, and it should therefore be approved;
Whereas the Commission should carry out Community inspections in Ireland to verify the application of the measures provided for in this Decision;

The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law; these are essential elements of the Agreement and thus form the basis for relations between us.\nThe European Union believes that the political situation in Togo is deadlocked and that the democratic deficit and scant consideration for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute a violation of the essential elements set out in Article 9 of the abovementioned Agreement.\nIn view of this Article and the current political deadlock in Togo the European Union decided on 30 March 2004 to start consultations under Article 96 of the Agreement in order to thoroughly review the situation and find a remedy if possible.\nThese consultations started in Brussels on 14 April 2004. Several fundamental issues were addressed, and you were able to present the Togolese authorities’ point of view and their analysis of the situation. The European Union was pleased to note that Togo made certain undertakings as stated in the Annex and proposed positive steps to improve the climate for democracy and the rule of law in the country.\nIt was agreed that an intensive dialogue on the various points raised would be held in Togo over a period of three months, and that the situation would be assessed at the end of this period.\nThis regular in-depth dialogue on a list of measures to be taken in order to implement the agreed undertakings has taken place.\nA number of significant measures have been taken by the Togolese authorities. In particular:\n—\nthe authorities have organised information and awareness-raising meetings with prefects and police concerning various aspects of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They have distributed instructions and circulars setting out the existing directives and rules. This has produced some positive results, confirmed by the opposition,\n—\nthe authorities have instructed the courts to bring to trial all persons remanded in custody in cases where preliminary investigations have been completed. This call for a speeding-up of procedures has led to the setting of 214 trial dates, including the cases of a number of prisoners considered political.

derogating from a threshold set in Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 for Union financial assistance in relation to aid measures provided for by Italy for the temporary cessation of fishing activities
2013/C 143/03
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (1), and in particular Article 24(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 24(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 provides that the financial contribution from the European Fisheries Fund to certain aid measures for the temporary cessation of fishing activities may not exceed 6 % of the Union financial assistance allocated to the fisheries sector in the Member State concerned. However, according to that Article, the threshold of 6 % may be increased by Commission decision.
(2) On 19 October 2012 Italy requested, through the computer system for data exchange, that the threshold be increased to 9 % for aid measures granted by Italy for the temporary cessation of fishing activities.
(3) The request submitted by Italy concerns support from the European Fisheries Fund as regards public aid to fishers and owners of fishing vessels for temporary cessation measures adopted on the basis of Article 24(1)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 in the context of management plans adopted at national level within the framework of Union conservation measures which provide for gradual reductions of fishing effort. The national management plans for the Mediterranean fleet of trawlers adopted on 20 May 2011 provide, in accordance with Article 19 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 of 21 December 2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea (2), for measures imposing gradual reductions of fishing effort.
(4) The increase of the threshold from 6 % to 9 % has been requested by Italy, on the basis of past tenders and resulting expenditures, to provide sufficient financial allocations for the call for tenders covering the period running from 2013 to 2015.
(5) Considering the situation of crisis of the fleet concerned and the increased number of economic operators ceasing fishing activities in that fleet, Italy has the need to attain and go beyond the overcapacity reduction objectives set out in the operational programme for Community assistance from the European Fisheries Fund in Italy for the programming period 2007-2013, which will be adjusted following the adoption of this Decision.
(6) The allocations for temporary cessation of fishing activities under the operational programme for Community assistance from the European Fisheries Fund in Italy for the programming period 2007-2013, as approved by Commission Decision C(2007) 6792 of 19 December 2007, have almost been exhausted and additional allocations for temporary cessation of 8 % pursuant to the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 744/2008 (3) are no longer applicable.
(7) The financial contribution from the European Fisheries Fund to temporary cessation measures pursuant to Article 24(1)(i) to (vi) of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 should therefore be increased to a maximum of 9 % of the Union financial assistance allocated to the fisheries sector in Italy.

Whereas:
(1) By Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 of 4 July 2008 recognising protected zones exposed to particular plant health risks in the Community (2) certain Member States or certain areas in Member States were recognised as protected zones in respect of certain harmful organisms.
(2) By Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 certain parts of the Veneto region in Italy were recognised as a protected zone with respect to the harmful organism Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. until 31 March 2010.
(3) Following observations regarding the presence of that harmful organism in certain parts of the Veneto region made by the Commission during an inspection in Italy from 31 August to 11 September 2009, Italy informed the Commission on 23 October 2009 of the results of the latest survey carried out in the Veneto region for the presence of that harmful organism in September and October 2009. The results of this latest survey show that in the province of Venice there are 14 places, in which that harmful organism has been occurring for a period of at least the last three successive years in spite of the eradication measures taken by the Italian authorities. Consequently, those measures have proved to be ineffective.
(4) The latest survey results were discussed during the meeting of the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 19-20 October 2009. It was concluded that Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winsl. et al. has to be considered as established in the province of Venice. That province should therefore no longer be recognised as a protected zone in respect of that harmful organism.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 690/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 63(3)(a) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) The Amsterdam Treaty aims to establish progressively an area of freedom, security and justice and confers the right of initiative on the Commission in order to take the relevant measures on a harmonised immigration policy.
(2) It is essential that the uniform format for residence permits should contain all the necessary information and meet very high technical standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. This will contribute to the objective of preventing and fighting against illegal immigration and illegal residence. It must also be suited to use by all the Member States.
(3) The integration of biometric identifiers is an important step towards the use of new elements, which establish a more reliable link between the holder and the residence permit as an important contribution to ensuring that it is protected against fraudulent use. The specifications set out in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) document No 9303 Part 3 on Size 1 and 2 machine readable official documents should be taken into account.
(4) Furthermore, the vast majority of Member States apply the principle of one person one document, which enhances security even further. It should be examined whether this principle should be rendered mandatory.
(5) At its meeting in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003, the European Council stressed that a coherent approach was needed in the EU on biometric identifiers or biometric data, which would result in harmonised solutions for documents for third country nationals, EU citizens’ passports and information systems.
(6) The use of new technologies such as e-government and digital signature for access to e-services should be facilitated by giving Member States the possibility to use the storage medium used for the incorporation of biometric identifiers or an additional storage medium for that purpose in residence permits.
(7) The purpose of this Regulation is solely to set the security features and biometric identifiers to be used by the Member States in a uniform format of residence permit for third-country nationals.
(8) This Regulation only lays down specifications that are not secret; these specifications need to be supplemented by further specifications which may remain secret in order to prevent counterfeiting and falsifications and which may not include personal data or references to such data. Powers to adopt such supplementary specifications should be conferred on the Commission, which should be assisted by the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas (2).
(9) With regard to the personal data to be processed in the context of the uniform format for residence permits, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3) applies. It must be ensured that no further information is stored on the uniform format for residence permits unless provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002 (4), its Annex or unless it is mentioned in the relevant travel document.
(10) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of introducing biometric identifiers in interoperable formats to lay down rules for all Member States implementing the Schengen Convention. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(11) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation, whether it will implement it in its national law.
(12) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (5) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point C of Council Decision 1999/437/EC (6) on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom gave notice, by letter of 29 December 2003, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(14) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland gave notice, by letter of 19 December 2003, of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.

(notified under document number C(2008) 4344)
(2008/691/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for goods originating in certain States which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements (1), and in particular Article 36(4) of Annex II thereto,
Whereas:
(1) On 24 April 2008 Seychelles requested, in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, a derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for the period of one year starting from 1 March 2008. The request covers a total annual quantity of 4 000 tonnes of canned tuna of HS Heading 1604. The request is made because catches and supply of originating raw tuna have decreased in the South West Indian Ocean.
(2) According to the information provided by Seychelles the catches of raw tuna in 2007 were very low even compared to the normal seasonal variations. The indication for 2008 shows only a slight improvement over 2007 catch levels. This abnormal situation makes it impossible for Seychelles to comply with the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 during a certain period.
(3) In order to ensure that Seychelles may continue its exports to the European Community, following the expiration of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (2), a new derogation should be granted.
(4) To ensure smooth transition from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement to the ESA (Eastern and Southern Africa States)-EU Interim Economic Partnership Agreement a new derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 January 2008.
(5) A temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry taking into account the imports concerned, provided that certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration are respected.
(6) It is therefore justified to a grant temporary derogation under Article 36(1)(a) of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007.
(7) Seychelles will benefit from an automatic derogation from the rules of origin for canned tuna of HS Heading 1604 pursuant to Article 42(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the Interim Agreement establishing a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the Eastern and Southern Africa States, on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other part (ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement), when that Agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied.
(8) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations from them are to be superseded by the rules of the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, the entry into force or provisional application of which is expected to take place in 2008. The derogation therefore should not be granted for the requested period going beyond the end of 2008 but should be granted for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2008.
(9) In accordance with Article 42(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, the automatic derogation from the rules of origin is limited to an annual quota of 8 000 tonnes of canned for the countries having initialled the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement (Comoros, Mauritius, Madagascar, Seychelles and Zimbabwe). Mauritius has already lodged an official request for a temporary derogation in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 and other countries of the ESA region, notably Madagascar are expected to do the same. It would be inappropriate to grant derogations under Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 which exceed the annual quota for canned tuna granted to the ESA region under the ESA-EU Interim Partnership Agreement. The derogation therefore should not be granted for the requested quantities, but should be granted for 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna.
(10) Accordingly a derogation should be granted to Seychelles in respect of 3 000 tonnes of preserved tuna for a period from 1 January until 31 December 2008.
(11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3) lays down rules relating to the management of tariff quotas. In order to ensure efficient management carried out in close cooperation between the authorities of Seychelles, the customs authorities of the Community and the Commission, those rules should apply mutatis mutandis to the quantities imported under the derogation granted by this Decision.
(12) In order to allow more efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation, the authorities of Seychelles should communicate regularly to the Commission details of the EUR.1 movement certificates issued.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '23.8.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 225/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 August 2008\non a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Seychelles with regard to preserved tuna\n(notified under document number C(2008) 4344)\n(2008/691/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 24 April 2008 Seychelles requested, in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, a derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for the period of one year starting from 1 March 2008.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 85/591/EEC of 20 December 1985 concerning the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the monitoring of foodstuffs intended for human consumption(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 242/2004(4) fixes maximum limits for inorganic tin in canned foodstuffs and makes reference to measures laying down the sampling and analysis methods to be used.
(2) Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003, introduces a system of quality standards for laboratories entrusted by the Member States with the official control of foodstuffs.
(3) It seems necessary to fix general criteria, which the method of analysis has to comply with in order to ensure that laboratories, in charge of the control, use methods of analysis with comparable levels of performance. It is also of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach across the European Union. These interpretation rules are of application for the analytical result obtained on the sample for official control. In case of analysis for defence or referee purposes, the national rules apply.
(4) The provisions for the sampling and methods of analysis have been drawn up on the basis of present knowledge and they may be adapted to take account of advances in scientific and technological knowledge. Methods to analyse for total tin are appropriate for controls on inorganic tin. The possible presence of organic forms of tin are considered to be negligible in relation to the maximum levels set for inorganic tin.

Purpose and scope\n\nSamples intended for official checking of the levels of tin in canned foodstuffs shall be taken according to the methods described below. Aggregate samples thus obtained shall be considered as representative of the lots. Compliance with maximum levels laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 466/2001 shall be established on the basis of the levels determined in the laboratory samples.\n\n2. Definitions\n\nLot: an identifiable quantity of a food commodity delivered at one time and having been determined by the official to have common characteristics, such as origin, variety, type of packing, packer, consignor or markings.\n\nSublot: designated part of a lot in order to apply the sampling method on that designated part. Each sublot must be physically separate and identifiable.\n\nIncremental sample: a quantity of material taken from a single place in the lot or sublot.\n\nAggregate sample: the combined total of all the incremental samples taken from the lot or sublot.\n\nLaboratory sample: sample intended for the laboratory.\n\n3. General provisions\n\n3.1. Personnel\n\nSampling shall be performed by an authorised person as specified by the Member States.\n\n3.2. Material to be sampled\n\nEach lot which is to be examined must be sampled separately.\n\n3.3. Precautions to be taken\n\nIn the course of sampling and preparation of the samples precautions must be taken to avoid any changes, which would affect the tin content, adversely affect the analytical determination or make the aggregate samples unrepresentative.\n\n3.4. Incremental samples\n\nAs far as possible incremental samples should be taken at various places distributed throughout the lot or sublot. Departure from this procedure must be recorded in the record.\n\n3.5. Preparation of the aggregate sample\n\nThe aggregate sample is made up by uniting all incremental samples. This aggregate sample is homogenised in the laboratory.\n\n3.6. Replicate laboratory samples\n\nReplicate laboratory samples for enforcement, trade (defence) and referee purposes shall be taken from the homogenised aggregate sample unless this conflicts with Member States' rules on sampling.\n\n3.7. Packaging and transmission of samples\n\nEach sample shall be placed in a clean, inert container offering adequate protection from contamination and against damage in transit. All necessary precautions shall be taken to avoid any change in composition of the sample, which might arise during transportation or storage.\n\n3.8. Sealing and labelling of samples\n\nEach sample taken for official use shall be sealed at the place of sampling and identified following the Member State's regulations.\n\nA record must be kept of each sampling, permitting each lot to be identified unambiguously and giving the date and place of sampling together with any additional information likely to be of assistance to the analyst.\n\n4. Sampling plans\n\nThe sampling method applied shall ensure that the aggregate sample is representative for the lot that is to be controlled.\n\n4.1. Number of incremental samples\n\nThe minimum number of incremental samples to be taken from cans within a lot shall be as given in Table 1. The incremental samples taken from each can shall be of similar weight, resulting in an aggregate sample (see point 3.5).\n\nTable 1 Number of cans (incremental samples) which shall be taken to form the aggregate sample\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNote that the maximum levels apply to the contents of each can, but for feasibility of testing it is necessary to use an aggregate sampling approach. If the test result for the aggregate sample is less than but close to the maximum level and if it is suspected that individual cans might exceed the maximum level then it might be necessary to conduct further investigations.\n\n4.2. Sampling at retail stage\n\nSampling of foodstuffs at the retail stage should be done where possible in accordance with the above sampling provisions. Where this is not possible, other effective sampling procedures at retail stage can be used provided that they ensure sufficient representativeness for the sampled lot.\n\n5. Compliance of the lot or sublot with the specification\n\nThe control laboratory shall analyse the laboratory sample for enforcement in at least two independent analyses, and calculate the mean of the results.\n\nThe lot is accepted if the mean does not exceed the respective maximum level (as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 466/2001) taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.\n\nThe lot is non-compliant with the maximum level (as laid down in Regulation (EC) 466/2001) if the mean exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty and correction for recovery.""}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nSAMPLE PREPARATION AND CRITERIA FOR METHODS OF ANALYSIS USED IN OFFICIAL CHECKING OF THE LEVELS OF TIN IN CANNED FOODSTUFFS\n\n1. Precautions and general considerations for tin\n\nThe basic requirement is to obtain a representative and homogeneous laboratory sample without introducing secondary contamination.\n\nThe analyst should ensure that samples do not become contaminated during sample preparation. Wherever possible, apparatus coming into contact with the sample should be made of inert materials e.g. plastics such as polypropylene, PTFE etc., and these should be acid cleaned to minimise the risk of contamination. High quality stainless steel can be used for cutting edges.\n\nAll of the sample material received by the laboratory is to be used for the preparation of test material. Only very finely homogenised samples give reproducible results.\n\nThere are many satisfactory specific sample preparation procedures which may be used. Those described in the CEN Standard on the ""Determination of trace elements - Performance criteria and general consideration"" have been found to be satisfactory (1) but others may be equally valid.\n\n2. Treatment of the sample as received in the laboratory\n\nFinely grind (where relevant) and mix thoroughly the complete aggregate sample using a process that has been demonstrated to achieve complete homogenisation.\n\n3. Subdivision of samples for enforcement and defence purposes\n\nThe replicate samples for enforcement, trade (defence) and referee purposes shall be taken from the homogenised material unless this conflicts with Member States\' rules on sampling.\n\n4. Method of analysis to be used by the laboratory and laboratory control requirements\n\n4.1. Definitions\n\nA number of the most commonly used definitions that the laboratory will be required to use are given below:\n\nr= Repeatability, the value below which the absolute difference between 2 single test results obtained under repeatability conditions (i.e., same sample, same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory, and short interval of time) may be expected to lie within a specific probability (typically 95 %) and hence r = 2,8 × sr.\n\nsr= Standard deviation, calculated from results generated under repeatability conditions.\n\nRSDr= Relative standard deviation, calculated from results generated under repeatability conditions [(sr/\n\n>PIC FILE= ""L_2004042EN.002002.TIF"">) × 100], where\n\n>PIC FILE= ""L_2004042EN.002003.TIF"">\n\nis the average of results over all laboratories and samples.\n\nR= Reproducibility, the value below which the absolute difference between single test results obtained under reproducibility conditions (i.e., on identical material obtained by operators in different laboratories, using the standardised test method), may be expected to lie within a certain probability (typically 95 %); R = 2,8 × sR.\n\nsR= Standard deviation, calculated from results under reproducibility conditions.\n\nRSDR= Relative standard deviation calculated from results generated under reproducibility conditions [(sR/\n\n>PIC FILE= ""L_2004042EN.002004.TIF"">) × 100].\n\nHORRATr= the observed RSDr divided by the RSDr value estimated from the Horwitz equation using the assumption r = 0,66R.\n\nHORRATR= the observed RSDR value divided by the RSDR value calculated from the Horwitz equation (2).\n\nU= the expanded uncertainty, using a coverage factor of 2 which gives a level of confidence of approximately 95 %.\n\n4.2. General requirements\n\nMethods of analysis used for food control purposes must comply with the provisions of items 1 and 2 of the Annex to Council Directive 85/591/EEC of 20 December 1985 concerning the introduction of Community methods of sampling and analysis for the monitoring of foodstuffs intended for human consumption.\n\n4.3. Specific requirements\n\nWhere no specific methods for the determination of tin in canned foodstuffs are prescribed at Community level, laboratories may select any validated method provided the selected method meets the performance criteria indicated in Table 2. The validation should ideally include a certified reference material.\n\nTable 2 Performance criteria for methods of analysis for tin\n\n>TABLE>\n\n4.3.1. Performance Criteria - Uncertainty Function Approach\n\nHowever, an uncertainty approach may also be used to assess the suitability of the method of analysis to be used by the laboratory. The laboratory may use a method which will produce results within a maximum standard uncertainty. The maximum standard uncertainty can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n>REFERENCE TO A GRAPHIC>\n\nwhere:\n\nUf is the maximum standard uncertainty\n\nLOD is the limit of detection of the method\n\nC is the concentration of interest\n\nIf an analytical method provides results with uncertainty measurements less than the maximum standard uncertainty, the method will be equally suitable to one which meets the performance characteristics given in Table 2.\n\n4.4. Recovery calculation and reporting of results\n\nThe analytical result is to be reported corrected or uncorrected for recovery. The manner of reporting and the level of recovery must be reported. The analytical result corrected for recovery is used for checking compliance (see Annex I, point 5).\n\nThe analyst should note the ""Harmonised Guidelines for the Use of Recovery Information in Analytical Measurement"" (3) developed under IUPAC/ISO/AOAC. These Guidelines assist when determining recovery factors.\n\nThe analytical result has to be reported as x +/- U whereby x is the analytical result and U is the measurement uncertainty.\n\n4.5. Laboratory quality standards\n\nLaboratories must comply with Council Directive 93/99/EEC of 29 October 1993 on the subject of additional measures concerning the official control of foodstuffs.\n\n4.6. Other considerations for the analysis\n\nProficiency testing\n\nParticipation in appropriate proficiency testing schemes which comply with the ""International Harmonised Protocol for the Proficiency Testing of (Chemical) Analytical Laboratories"" (4) developed under the auspices of IUPAC/ISO/AOAC.\n\nSome of these schemes specifically include the determination of tin in foods, and participation in such a scheme is recommended rather than a general scheme for the determination of metals in foods.\n\nInternal quality control\n\nLaboratories should be able to demonstrate that they have internal quality control procedures in place. Examples of these are the ""ISO/AOAC/IUPAC Guidelines on Internal Quality Control in Analytical Chemistry Laboratories"" (5).\n\nSample preparation\n\nCare must be taken to ensure that all the tin in the sample is taken into solution for analysis. In particular it is recognised that the sample dissolution procedure must be such that no hydrolysed SnIV species is precipitated (i.e. species such as stannic oxide SnO2, Sn(OH)4, SnO2.H2O).\n\nKeep prepared samples in 5 mol/l HCl. However, SnCl4 is easily volatilised and so solutions should not be boiled.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’),
Having regard to Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013 of 13 May 2013 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware originating in the People's Republic of China (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 13 May 2013 the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Union of ceramic tableware and kitchenware (‘tableware’) originating in the People's Republic of China (‘the PRC’) with Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013.
(2) In the original investigation a large number of exporting producers from the PRC made themselves known. As a result the Commission selected a sample of Chinese exporting producers to be investigated.
(3) The Council imposed individual duty rates on imports of tableware ranging from 13,1 % to 23,4 % on the sampled companies, and 17,9 % on other cooperating companies not included in the sample.
(4) The Council also imposed a duty rate of 36,1 % on imports of tableware from Chinese companies which either did not make themselves known or did not cooperate with the investigation.
(5) Article 3 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013 states that where any new exporting producer of tableware in the PRC provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that:
(1) it did not export to the Union ceramic tableware and kitchenware during the investigation period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011 (‘the investigation period’);
(2) it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the PRC which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation; and
(3) it has actually exported to the Union the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Union;
B.   REQUESTS FOR NEW EXPORTING PRODUCER TREATMENT
(6) Four companies came forward after the publication of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013 claiming that they met all three criteria set out above in recital (5) and providing evidence.
(7) All four companies are manufacturers and exporters of the product concerned.
(8) Three of them were in existence during the original investigation but they did not export to the Union during the original investigation period.
(9) The fourth company did not exist during the original investigation and therefore could not have exported during the investigation period.
(10) The Commission analysed the evidence submitted by all four companies and it found that each of the four companies meet the three criteria to be considered as New Exporting Producers. Consequently, their names can be added to the cooperating companies not included in the sample as listed in Annex I of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013.
(11) The four companies and the Union industry were informed of the findings of this investigation and were given an opportunity to comment. No comments were received.
(12) This Regulation is in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 15(1) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '25.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 219/33', 'title': ""COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 803/2014\nof 24 July 2014\namending Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of ceramic tableware and kitchenware originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\nThe following companies shall be added to the list of exporting producers from the People's Republic of China in Annex\xa0I of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013:\nCompany\nTARIC additional code\nLiling Taiyu Porcelain Industries Co., Ltd\nB956\nLiling Xinyi Ceramics Industry Ltd\nB957\nT&C Shantou Daily Chemical Industry Co., Ltd\nB958\nJing He Ceramics Co., Ltd\nB959""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nAs stipulated in Article 1(3) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 412/2013, the application of the individual anti-dumping duty rate shall be conditional upon presentation to the customs authorities of the Member States of a valid commercial invoice, which shall conform to the requirements set out in Annex II to that Regulation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the control of salmonella and other specified food-borne zoonotic agents (1) and, in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 lays down rules for the detection and control of salmonella in poultry. Pursuant to Article 8(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, it may be decided that specific control methods are not to be used as part of national control programmes established by Member States to achieve the Community targets set up in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Pursuant to Article 8(1)(a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 it may be decided that specific control methods are or may be applied for the reduction of prevalence of zoonoses and zoonotic agents at the stage of the primary production of animals and other stages in the food chain, and rules may be adopted concerning the conditions for the use of such methods.
(3) Pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, the Commission is to consult the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) before proposing rules on specific control methods.
(4) The Commission consulted the EFSA on the use of antimicrobials and vaccines for the control of salmonella in poultry. Following that consultation, the EFSA issued two separate opinions on those issues on 21 October 2004.
(5) In its opinion on the use of antimicrobials for the control of salmonella in poultry, the EFSA recommended that the use of antimicrobials should be discouraged due to public health risks associated with development, selection and spread of resistance. The use of antimicrobials should be subject to formally defined conditions that would ensure protection of public health, and must be fully justified in advance and recorded by the competent authority.
(6) Therefore, on the basis of the opinion of the EFSA, it is appropriate to provide that antimicrobials should not be used as part of national control programmes to be adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, other than in the exceptional circumstances referred to by the EFSA in its opinion.
(7) In any circumstances, only veterinary medicinal products authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (2), or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (3), should be used.
(8) Antimicrobial veterinary medicinal products are referred to as antimicrobials in this Regulation. Products which are authorised as feed additives in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (4) are however also considered as antimicrobials. They should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation because the use of these additives may be a tool to limit salmonella infection by the feed while they are not associated with the development, selection and spread of resistance.
(9) The EFSA concluded in its opinion on the use of vaccines for the control of salmonella in poultry, that vaccination of poultry is regarded as an additional measure to increase the resistance of birds against salmonella exposure and decrease the shedding.
(10) The EFSA in its opinion also stated in particular that provided that the detection methods are able to differentiate the vaccine strains from wild strains, both currently available inactivated and live vaccines can be safely used throughout the life of the birds, except during the withdrawal period before slaughter and, with regard to live vaccines, in laying hens during production. Vaccination of layers is considered useful as a measure to reduce shedding and egg contamination, when the purpose is to reduce high prevalences. Salmonella enteritidis is the most important cause of outbreaks in humans by the consumption of eggs.
(11) Therefore, on the basis of the opinion of the EFSA, it is appropriate to provide that currently available live vaccines should not be used as part of national control programmes to be adopted pursuant to Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, in laying hens during production. Live vaccines should not be used if the manufacturer does not provide an appropriate method to distinguish bacteriologically wild-type strains of salmonella from vaccine strains.
(12) Based on the current scientific evidence, the use of live or inactivated vaccines against Salmonella enteritidis should be mandatory in Member States with a high prevalence in order to improve public health protection. The prevalence of Salmonella enteritidis demonstrated during a baseline study in accordance with Commission Decision 2004/665/EC (5) and in the frame of the testing schemes in accordance with Article 4(2)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003, should be used as a threshold for mandatory vaccination.
(13) As regards breeding flocks, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2005 implementing Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards requirements for the use of specific control methods in the framework of the national programmes for the control of salmonella (6), lays down provisions on the use of antimicrobials and vaccines as part of national control programmes for salmonella in breeding flocks of Gallus gallus.
(14) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 1091/2005 by this Regulation.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '2.8.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 212/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1177/2006\nof 1 August 2006\nimplementing Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards requirements for the use of specific control methods in the framework of the national programmes for the control of salmonella in poultry\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 2160/2003 lays down rules for the detection and control of salmonella in poultry.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation;
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.
(11) Import duties and export refunds still apply to certain sugar products traded between the Community, on the one hand, and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, hereafter known as the ""new Member States"", on the other, and the level of export refunds is appreciably greater than the level of import duties. In view of the accession of those countries to the Community on 1 May 2004, the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted on the products in question may result in speculative trade movements.
(12) In order to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, levies and refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be set for all the new Member States.
(13) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 902/2004 of 29 April 2004 fixing the export refunds on syrups and certain other sugar products exported in the natural state', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d), (f), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the natural state, shall be set out in the Annex hereto to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 30 April 2004.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 April 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.

Whereas, in accordance with Article 72 (1) of the Act of Accession, accession compensatory amounts are to be equal to the difference between the prices fixed for Spain and the intervention prices applicable for the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, which prices represent the guarantee given to producers; whereas, however, following the change in the intervention arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2221/88 (3), buying in is carried out at a level below the intervention price; whereas that level, which now represents the actual guarantee given to producers must, therefore, serve as a basis for calculating the accession compensatory amounts;
Whereas, in view of the alignment of Spanish prices on Community prices for maize and common wheat, from 1 July 1988 accession compensatory amounts should be fixed for the abovementioned cereals; whereas the parties concerned should however be permitted to recover the accession compensatory amounts already levied for those products before the entry into force of this Regulation;
Whereas in accordance with Article 111 (3) of the Act of Accession, accession compensatory amounts applicable to processed products are to be derived from those applicable to the products to which they are related, using coefficients to be determined; whereas those coefficients must be fixed taking account, on the one hand, of the technical factors relating to processing and, on the other hand, of the fact that those compensatory amounts apply to imports, to exports and in trade between the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985 and Spain;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products(1), and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 provides for the possibility of adopting common marketing standards for fishery products in the Community, particularly in order to facilitate commerce based on fair competition. These standards may, in particular, cover labelling.
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2136/89(2) lays down common marketing standards for preserved sardines in the Community.
(3) The widening variety of supply of preserved products marketed and presented in the same way as preserved sardines in the Community makes it necessary to provide consumers with sufficient information on the identity and the main characteristics of the product. It is therefore necessary to lay down common rules on trade descriptions for preserved products marketed and presented in the same way as preserved sardines in the Community.
(4) The Codex Alimentarius standard Codex STAN94 as well as the particular conditions prevailing on the Community market should be taken into account to that purpose.
(5) In the interest of market transparency, fair competition and variety of choice, it is necessary to specify that preserved sardine-type products should be prepared exclusively from well defined species.
(6) It is necessary to take account of changes in the Combined Nomenclature codes for preserved sardines.
(7) The term ""sardine"" can only be part of the trade description of sardine-type products if it is adequately qualified. Trade descriptions based on geographic names alone are not sufficiently distinctive. In order to enable a proper identification of each sardine-type product, thus avoiding confusion between different fish species, the scientific name of the species should be used as a qualifier term.
(8) The combination of the word ""sardines"" with the common name of a sardine-type fish species can only generate confusion as to the true nature of the product. On the other hand, common names not including the word ""sardines"" may continue to be used for the marketing of sardine-type products, in accordance with the law of the Member State on marketing and in a manner not to mislead the consumers.
(9) The requirements laid down in this Regulation should be applied without prejudice to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(3).
(10) Regulation (EEC) No 2136/89 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fishery Products,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1181/2003 of 2 July 2003 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 2136/89 laying down common marketing standards for preserved sardines', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 2136/89 is amended as follows:\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products and repealing Directives 85/358/EEC and 86/469/EEC and Decisions 89/187/EEC and 91/664/EEC (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 29(1) and Article 29(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 96/23/EC lays down measures to monitor the substances and groups of residues listed in Annex I thereto. Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries, provided for in Community legislation, from which Member States are authorised to import animals and primary products of animal origin covered by that Directive, are subject to submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in that Directive.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC (2) lists those third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.
(3) Certain third countries have presented residue monitoring plans to the Commission for animals and products of animal origin not currently listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. The evaluation of those plans and the additional information requested by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring in those third countries for the animals and products concerned. The relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be included in the list for those third countries in that Decision.
(4) Certain third countries have voluntarily asked not to be included in the list in Decision 2004/432/EC for some categories of animals and products of animal origin. The entries concerning relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be deleted from the list for those third countries.
(5) Certain third countries which are currently listed for certain animals or products of animal origin under Decision 2004/432/EC have not submitted to the Commission the requested guarantees for some of these animals and products of animal origin. In the absence of such guarantees, the entries for the relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be deleted in the list for those third countries. The third countries concerned have been informed accordingly.
(6) In addition, certain third countries are listed in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC for bovine, ovine/caprine, swine and equine with the limitation ‘only for casings’. That limitation was inserted in that Annex as an information on the third countries from which casings should be allowed to be imported. However, those third countries have not to submit a residue plan specifically for casings for approval, since a residue monitoring plan is not considered to be needed for these products. Accordingly, in the interest of clarity of Community legislation the entries with the limitation ‘only for casings’ should be deleted from the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC, without any prejudice to the imports of such products.
(7) The responsibility to evaluate the residue control plans for all categories of animals and products of animal origin from Norway lies with the EFTA Surveillance Authority. Therefore the entries for that country should be deleted from the list in the Annex to Decision 2004/432/EC.
(8) The State Union of Serbia and Montenegro has dissolved. Therefore the footnote which refers to the previous denomination should be deleted from the list in that Annex.
(9) Decision 2004/432/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '17.2.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 49/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 12 February 2007\namending Decision 2004/432/EC on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC\n(notified under document number C(2007) 403)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/115/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 96/23/EC lays down measures to monitor the substances and groups of residues listed in Annex I thereto.

(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Fenthion is one of the 89 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 4 April 1996 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifier Bayer CropScience as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(6) The Commission organised two tripartite meetings with the main data submitter and the rapporteur Member State for this active substance on 18 April 1997 and 11 February 2003.
(7) The assessment report prepared by Greece has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This review was finalised on 4 July 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for fenthion.
(8) The dossier and the information from the review were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants (SCP). The SCP was asked to comment on the establishment of an Acceptable Daily Intake and an Acceptable Operator Exposure Level. In its first opinion of 2 October 1998, and based on the conclusions of the human and environmental risk assessment, the SCP considered that it was not possible to complete a full assessment in the absence of data to prove that even the limited intended use as bait application on citrus and olive was safe for human health and the environment. The SCP particularly noted the very high acute risk for birds. In that opinion, the SCP acknowledged that the development of an innovative technique of application, namely bait formulation including fenthion plus attractant on only a part of the crop, might be promising to achieve limited exposure of humans and the environment; however it noted that specific studies would have to be made available on such a type of application before a conclusive evaluation could be made.
Additional information, in particular in relation to the bait application use, has subsequently been submitted by Bayer CropScience and has been evaluated. The additional information and its evaluation has been submitted to the SCP. In its opinion of 17 December 2002 the SCP concluded that the risk to birds from the proposed uses of fenthion remained uncertain. As a result, the concerns in relation to possible risks to birds raised in its previous opinion remained unresolved.
(9) Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing fenthion satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to its possible impact on birds.
(10) Fenthion should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(11) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing fenthion are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(12) In the light of the information submitted to the Commission it appears that, in the absence of efficient alternatives for certain limited uses in certain Member States, there is a need for further use of the active substance so as to enable the development of alternatives. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available for the control of harmful organisms.
(13) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing fenthion allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(14) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(8).

The form of the data\n\nThe data is sent as a set of records of which a large part describes the characteristics of the data (country, year, economic activity, etc.). The data itself is a number which can be linked to flags and explanatory footnotes used for example to describe aggregations of NACE codes. Confidential data should be sent with the true value being recorded in the value field and a flag indicating the nature of the confidential data being added to the record.\n\nIn order to be precise about the nature of the data, it is necessary to distinguish the following special cases:\n\n- data equal to zero (coded ""0""): real values of zero only,\n\n- confidential data (coded ""x""): indicates data which the Member State does not transmit to Eurostat because the data is confidential,\n\n- missing data (coded ""m""): this is data which is currently missing but the Member State intends to supply when available,\n\n- data not available: this is data which is not collected in a Member State. In this case the corresponding record is not sent.\n\nBy default, if an entire dimension (a variable, a NUTS code, a NACE code, etc.) is not collected then the corresponding records will not exist except for those which are missing because they form part of a regrouping of NACE codes. This is why it is important to distinguish data which is really missing by supplying a record (one per missing item) in which the data value is coded as ""m"", and data which is really equal to zero by supplying the corresponding records in which the data value is set to 0.\n\n2. Record structure\n\n>TABLE>\n\nThis format may be converted into a fixed format by using the maximum length of each field and right justifying the contents of each field preceded by blanks.\n\n3.

Data value\n\nMonetary data is expressed in millions of national currency units except for:\n\n- Italy: data is given in milliards of national currency units.\n\nIn order to be precise about the nature of the data, it is necessary to distinguish the following cases:\n\n- data equal to zero (coded ""0""): real values of zero only,\n\n- confidential data (coded ""x""): indicates data which the Member State does not transmit to Eurostat because the data is confidential. A flag should also be used to indicate that the data is missing due to confidentiality (see 3.14 below),\n\n- missing data (coded ""m""): this is data which is currently missing but the Member State intends to supply when available,\n\n- data not available: this is data which is not collected in a Member State. In this case the corresponding record is not sent.\n\nBy default, if an entire dimension (a variable, a NUTS code, a NACE code, etc.) is not collected then the corresponding records will not exist except for those which are missing because they form part of a regrouping of NACE codes. This is why it is important to distinguish data which is really missing by supplying a record (one per missing item) in which the data value is coded as ""m"".\n\n3.13. Quality flag\n\n>TABLE>\n\n""Revised data"" refers to data which are sent for a second (or more) time and are corrections of data which has been previously sent.\n\n""Updated data"" concerns data which was not previously available and was coded as missing in the data value field (see 3.12 above) but has since become available.\n\nThe flag indicating ""Provisional data"" should be used in order to indicate that it is likely that the data being transmitted may be corrected.\n\n3.14. Confidentiality\n\nMember States are asked to clearly indicate confidential data using the flags listed below:\n\nCountries which cannot send confidential data are asked to set the value to ""x"" (see 3.12 above) and to indicate using a flag that the data is missing due to confidentiality.\n\n>TABLE>\n\n3.15. Dominance\n\nA numeric value less than or equal to 100. This indicates the percentage dominance of one or two enterprises which dominate the data and make it confidential. The value is rounded to the nearest whole number: e.g. 90,3 becomes 90, 94, 50 becomes 95. This field is blank for non-confidential data. This field is only used when the confidentiality flags B or C are used in the previous field.\n\n3.16.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Fourth ACP-EEC Convention (1) entered into force on 1 September 1991;
Whereas Protocol 6 of the said Convention stipulates that products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States which fall within CN codes 2208 40 10, 2208 40 90, 2208 90 19 shall, until the entry into force of a common organization of  the market in spirits, be allowed into the Community free of customs duties under conditions such as to permit the development of traditional traffic flows between the ACP States and the Community, on the one hand, and between the Member States, on the  other; whereas, the Community shall, until 31 December 1995, fix each year the quantities which may be imported free of customs duties; whereas, according to that protocol, these quantities are to be fixed for 1993 on the basis of the largest quantities  imported annually from the ACP States into the Community during the past three years for which statistics are available, whereas, for 1994, the quota will be the same as that for the previous year increased by 20 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas, having regard to the levels reached by imports of the products concerned into the Community during the past three years for which statistics are available, on the one hand, and as a result of the application of the new method of calculation in  force from 1 January 1994, on the other, the annual quota volume for the period from 1 July 1993 to 30 June 1994 must be fixed at 224 827 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas this volume is calculated using the following criteria:
- for the second half of 1993, the quota volume shall be equivalent to the level reached by imports into the Community during the second half of 1991, namely, 107 693 hectolitres of pure alcohol, this being the largest volume of imports attained during  the corresponding periods of the three previous years for which full statistics are available,
- for the first half of 1994, the quota volume shall be equivalent to that of the first half of 1993, namely, 107 134 hectolitres of pure alcohol, increased by 10 000 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the said quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for this quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the products in question into all the Member States until the  quota is exhausted; whereas the decision for the opening of tariff quotas in fulfilment of its international obligations should be taken by the Communiy; whereas, to ensure the efficient common administration of these quotas, however, there is no  obstacle to authorizing the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas, however, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission  and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quota are used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas measures should be laid down to ensure that Protocol 6 is implemented under conditions which permit the development of traditional trade flows between the ACP States and the Community, on the one hand, and between the Member States, on the  other;

Whereas:
(1) As from 1 January 2007, the European Union includes two new Member States, Romania and Bulgaria. Article 6(7) of the Act of Accession provides that the quantitative restrictions applied by the Community on imports of textile and clothing products are to be adjusted to take account of the accession of the new Member States to the Community. The quantitative restrictions applicable to imports of certain textile products from third countries into the enlarged Community should consequently be adjusted so as to cover imports into the two new Member States. This necessitates amendments to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries (1).
(2) In order to prevent the enlargement of the Community from having restrictive effects on trade, it is appropriate, when amending the quantities, to use a methodology which takes into account, for the purpose of adjusting the new quota levels, the traditional imports into the new Member States. A formula consisting of the average of the last three years' imports into the two new Member States originating in third countries, provides an adequate measurement of those historical flows. A growth rate has been added. The years 2003 to 2005 have been selected as the most significant, as they represent the latest available information about the two new Member States' imports in textiles and clothing.
(3) Accordingly, Annexes V and VII to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be amended to list quota levels applicable from the date of the enlargement, namely 1 January 2007.
(4) All provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 should be adapted so as to apply to imports into the new Member States. Consequently, the initials of the new Member States should be inserted in Annex III.

(2) to take account of the special conditions in which table wines are produced in Spain, temporary derogations should be laid down concerning blending of wines in that Member State;
(3) as a temporary derogation, the total acidity of table wines should be fixed at a lower level in certain wine-growing zones;
(4) pending application of the reform of the sector and in order to avoid any legal hiatus, certain provisions referred to in Article 39 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87(5) should be extended for a further wine year;
(5) Article 46(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 provides that campaigns to promote the consumption of grape juice may be conducted only until the 1998/1999 wine year; they should be continued for one wine year so that their effectiveness may be assessed;
(6) Article 65(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 provides that, during the 1998/1999 wine year, the Commission is to submit to the Council a report on maximum sulphur dioxide levels in wine and any proposals arising therefrom; the significance for the sector of the sulphur dioxide problem calls for proposals taking account in particular of the work of the International Vine and Wine Office (IWO); that time limit should therefore be deferred by one wine year,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1677/1999 of 19 July 1999 amending Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 on the common organisation of the market in wine', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 822/87 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. the following paragraph shall be inserted in Article 6: ""1a.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 11 July 2006
abrogating Decision 2005/184/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Cyprus
(2006/627/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2005/184/EC (1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, it was decided that an excessive deficit existed in Cyprus.
(2) In accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (2), the Council made a recommendation on 5 July 2004 addressed to Cyprus with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2005 at the latest. The recommendation was made public. Specifically, it was recommended that the measures envisaged in the May 2004 convergence programme be implemented with vigour; in particular, that effective action be taken by 5 November 2004 in order to bring the deficit below 3 % of GDP in 2005 in a credible and sustainable manner. The Council also recommended ensuring that the rise in the debt ratio be brought to a halt in 2004 and reversed thereafter. The Council invited the Cypriot authorities to ensure that budgetary consolidation towards the medium-term objective (MTO) be sustained after the excessive deficit has been corrected.
(3) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(4) In accordance with the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of that Protocol, Member States are to provide data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (3).
(5) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 8g of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 following the notification by Cyprus before 1 April 2006 and on the Commission services' Spring 2006 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:
— the general government deficit was reduced from 4,1 % of GDP in 2004 to 2,4 % of GDP in 2005, which is below the 3 % of GDP deficit reference value. This compares with a target of 2,9 % of GDP set in the May 2004 update of the convergence programme and with the 2,5 % target of the latest Convergence Programme update of December 2005. The reduction below the reference value in 2005 is in line with the recommendation under Article 104(7) of the Treaty. Fiscal adjustment was pursued in 2005 through both revenue increases and expenditure restraint. Although some one-off measures helped reduce the deficit, the budgetary consolidation in Cyprus was achieved mainly through structural measures. The structural deficit (the cyclically adjusted deficit net of one-off and other temporary measures) fell to 3 % of GDP, compared to almost 5 % and 8 % of GDP in 2004 and 2003 respectively,
— for 2006, the Commission services' spring 2006 forecast projects the deficit to be reduced further, to 2,25 % of GDP, largely through measures of a structural nature. This is slightly above the official deficit target of 1,9 % of GDP set in the December 2005 update of the convergence programme. For 2007, the spring forecast projects, on a no-policy-change basis, a further decline in the deficit to 2 % of GDP. This suggests that the deficit has been brought below the 3 % of GDP ceiling in a credible and sustainable manner, as required by the recommendation under Article 104(7),
— Government debt declined from 71,75 % of GDP in 2004 to 70,25 % in 2005. According to the Commission services' spring 2006 forecast, the debt ratio is projected to fall further to around 69 % and 68 % of GDP in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The pace of debt reduction towards the 60 % of GDP reference value is in line with the recommendation under Article 104(7).
(6) According to the Council opinion of 14 March 2006 on the updated convergence programme of Cyprus, 2005 to 2009, the measures planned by the Cypriot authorities over the programme period would bring the structural deficit to about 0,5 % of GDP by 2009, which is considered the medium-term objective chosen by the Cypriot authorities. Based on the estimated outturn for 2005 and taking account of the balance of risks to the budgetary targets, the budgetary stance in the programme seems sufficient to ensure that the programme's MTO is almost reached by 2009, as envisaged in the programme. In the years following the correction of the excessive deficit, the pace of adjustment towards the programme's MTO implied by the programme is broadly in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.
(7) Decision 2005/184/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '20.9.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 256/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 11 July 2006\nabrogating Decision 2005/184/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Cyprus\n(2006/627/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 2005/184/EC(1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, it was decided that an excessive deficit existed in Cyprus.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(2), the Council made a recommendation on 5 July 2004 addressed to Cyprus with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2005 at the latest.

on the tariff rates for bananas
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (1) provides for the entry into force of a tariff only regime for imports of bananas no later than 1 January 2006.
(2) On 12 July 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 with a view to modifying certain concessions for bananas. Accordingly, the Community notified the WTO on 15 July 2004 of its intention to modify concessions on item 0803 00 19 (bananas) in EC Schedule CXL. Negotiations have been conducted by the Commission in consultation with the Committee established by Article 133 of the Treaty and the Special Committee on Agriculture and within the framework of the negotiating directives issued by the Council.
(3) The Commission has not been able to negotiate an acceptable agreement with Ecuador and Panama, having a principal supplying interest, and Colombia and Costa Rica, having a substantial supplier interest, in products of HS subheading 0803 00 19 (bananas). Pursuant to the Annex to the Decision of the WTO Ministerial Conference of 14 November 2001 on the European Communities — the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, the Commission has also held consultations with other WTO Members. These consultations did not lead to an acceptable agreement.
(4) On 31 January 2005 the Community notified the WTO of its intention to replace its concessions on item 0803 00 19 (bananas) with a bound duty of EUR 230/tonne.
(5) The arbitration procedure set out in the Annex to the Decision was initiated on 30 March 2005. The Arbitrator’s Award issued on 1 August 2005 concluded that the MFN tariff rate of EUR 230/tonne proposed by the Community was not consistent with the abovementioned Annex as it would not result in at least maintaining total market access for MFN suppliers. The Commission revised the Community proposal in light of the arbitrator’s findings. In a second arbitration award, issued on 27 October 2005, the Arbitrator concluded that the revised proposal for an MFN tariff rate of EUR 187 tonne fails to rectify the matter. The Commission has therefore further modified its proposal in order to rectify the matter.
(6) A tariff rate quota for bananas originating in ACP countries should also be opened in accordance with the Community commitments under the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.
(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation, as well as transitional measures relating in particular to the management of the tariff rate quota for bananas originating in ACP countries, should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (2),","{'header': '2.12.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 316/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1964/2005\nof 29 November 2005\non the tariff rates for bananas', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1)provides for the entry into force of a tariff only regime for imports of bananas no later than 1\xa0January 2006.\n\n((2)) On 12 July 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXVIII of the GATT 1994 with a view to modifying certain concessions for bananas.
