Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;

of 7 June 2006
amending Council Directive 90/642/EEC as regards the maximum residue levels of fenbutatin-oxide, fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, triadimephon/triadimenol, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, authorisations of plant protection products for use on specific crops are the responsibility of the Member States. Such authorisations have to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.
(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.
(3) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) for pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC are to be kept under review and may be modified to take account of new or changed uses. Information about new or changed uses has been communicated to the Commission with respect to fenbutatin oxide, fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, triadimephon/triadimenol, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin.
(4) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (3). Based on those assessment and evaluations, the MRLs for those pesticides should be set so as to ensure that the acceptable daily intake is not exceeded.
(5) In the case of pymetrozine, linuron, triadimenol, pyraclostrobine and fenbutatin oxide for which an acute reference dose (ARfD) exists, the acute exposure of consumers via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee on Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides (4), have been taken into account. Based on the intake assessment of pymetrozine, linuron, triadimenol, pyraclostrobine and fenbutatin oxide, the MRLs for those five pesticides should be fixed so as to ensure that the ARfD will not be exceeded. In the case of the other substances, an assessment of the available information has shown that no ARfD is required and that therefore a short term assessment is not needed.
(6) Where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residues in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data, MRLs should be fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(7) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new MRLs for those pesticides.
(8) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of these substances. The provisional Community MRL should then become definitive.
(9) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '8.6.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 154/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/53/EC\nof 7 June 2006\namending Council Directive 90/642/EEC as regards the maximum residue levels of fenbutatin-oxide, fenhexamid, cyazofamid, linuron, triadimephon/triadimenol, pymetrozine, and pyraclostrobin\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, authorisations of plant protection products for use on specific crops are the responsibility of the Member States.

(2) Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1433/2003, laying down transitional provisions, as corrected by Regulation (EC) No 1582/2003, lays down that producer organisations must submit requests for amendments needed to bring operational programmes into line with that Regulation on 15 October 2003 at the latest, rather than 15 September as initially laid down.

fixing the export refunds on beef and veal and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3846/87 establishing an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds and (EC) No 1445/95 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2345/2001(2), and in particular Article 33(12) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33 of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 32/82(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 744/2000(4), Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2772/2000(6), and Regulation (EEC) No 2388/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3661/92(8), lay down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of beef and veal and certain preserved beef and veal products.
(3) It follows from applying those rules and criteria to the foreseeable situation on the market in beef and veal that the refund should be as set out below.
(4) With regard to live animals, for reasons of simplification export refunds should no longer be granted for categories with insignificant trade with third countries. Moreover, in light of the general concern of animal welfare, export refunds for live animals for slaughter should be limited as much as possible. Consequently, export refunds for such animals should only be granted for third countries which for cultural and/or religious reasons traditionally import substantial numbers of animals for domestic slaughter. As to live animals for reproduction, in order to prevent any abuse export refunds for pure-bred breeding animals should be limited to heifers and cows of no more than 30 months of age.
(5) Export refunds should be granted for certain destinations on some fresh or chilled meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0201, on some frozen meat listed in the Annex under CN code 0202, on some meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 0206 and on some other prepared or preserved meat or offal listed in the Annex under CN code 1602 50 10.
(6) In view of the wide differences in products covered by CN codes 0201 20 90 97/00 and 0202 20 90 91/00 used for refund purposes, refunds should only be granted on cuts in which the weight of bone does not exceed one third.
(7) In the case of meat of bovine animals, boned or boneless, salted and dried, there are traditional trade flows to Switzerland. To allow this trade to continue, the refund should be set to cover the difference between prices on the Swiss market and export prices in the Member States.
(8) In the case of certain other cuts and preserves of meat or offal shown in the Annex under CN codes 1602 50 31 to 1602 50 80, the Community presence of international trade may be maintained by granting a refund corresponding to that at present available.
(9) In the case of other beef and veal products, a refund need not be fixed since the Community's share of world trade is not significant.
(10) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2319/2002(10), establishes the agricultural product nomenclature for the purposes of export refunds. Following the introduction of refunds for pure-bred breeding female animals of maximum 30 months of age, the product nomenclature referred to above should be modified.
(11) In order to simplify customs export formalities for operators, the refunds on all frozen cuts should be brought into line with those on fresh or chilled cuts other than those from adult male bovine animals.
(12) Checks on products covered by CN code 1602 50 should be stepped up by making the granting of refunds on these products conditional on manufacture under the arrangements provided for in Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 565/80 of 4 March 1980 on the advance payment of export refunds in respect of agricultural products(11), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2026/83(12).
(13) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(13), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(14), Council Directive 94/65/EC(15) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(16), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(17), respectively.
(14) Under Article 6(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/82, the special refund is to be reduced if the quantity of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(15) The negotiations on the adoption of additional concessions, held within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and the associated Central and Eastern European Countries, aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market in beef and veal. On this background, Romania should be removed from the list of destinations giving rise to the grant of a refund. The abolition of refunds may not, however, lead to the creation of a differentiated refund for exports to other countries.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 105a(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Monetary Institute (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
(1) Whereas, at the meeting of the European Council in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995, the scenario for the changeover to the single currency was adopted which provides for introduction of euro coins by 1 January 2002 at the latest; whereas the precise date for the issue of euro coins will be decided when the Council adopts its regulation on the introduction of the euro immediately after the decision on the Member States adopting the euro as the single currency has been taken as early as possible in 1998;
(2) Whereas, according to Article 105a(2) of the Treaty, Member States may issue coins subject to approval by the European Central Bank (ECB) of the volume of the issue and the Council may, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c and after consulting the ECB, adopt measures to harmonise the denominations and technical specifications of all coins intended for circulation to the extent necessary to permit their smooth circulation within the Community;
(3) Whereas the European Monetary Institute has indicated that euro banknotes will range from EUR 5 to EUR 500; whereas the denominations of banknotes and coins will need to allow for cash payments of amounts expressed in euro and cent to be made easily;
(4) Whereas the mint directors of the Community received a mandate from the Council to study and elaborate a report for a European single coinage system; whereas they submitted a report in November 1996 followed by a revised report in February 1997 indicating the denominations and technical specifications (diameter, thickness, weight, colour, composition and edge) of the new euro coins;
(5) Whereas the new European single coinage system should induce public confidence and entail technological innovations that would establish it as a secure, reliable and efficient system;
(6) Whereas the acceptance of the new system by the public is one of the main objectives of the Community coinage system; whereas public confidence in the new system would depend on the physical characteristics of the euro coins, which should be as user-friendly as possible;
(7) Whereas consultations with consumer associations, the European Blind Union and representatives of the vending machines industry have been carried out to take into account the specific requirements of important categories of coin users; whereas, in order to ensure a smooth changeover to the euro and to facilitate acceptance of the new coinage systems by users, easy distinction between coins through visual and tactile characteristics will need to be guaranteed;
(8) Whereas the new euro coins will be more readily distinguishable and easier to become accustomed to if there is a link between their diameter and face value;
(9) Whereas certain special security features are needed in order to reduce the scope for fraud for the 1 and 2 euro given their high value; whereas the use of a technique whereby coins are made in three layers and the combination of two different colours in the coin are considered to be the most efficient security features available today;
(10) Whereas giving the coins one European and one national side is an appropriate expression of the idea of European monetary union between Member States and could significantly increase the degree of acceptance of the coins by European citizens;
(11) Whereas on 30 June 1994 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 94/27/EC (4), which limited the use of nickel in certain products in recognition that nickel could be cause of allergies under certain conditions; whereas coins are not covered by that Directive; whereas, nevertheless, some Member States already use a nickel-free alloy called Nordic Gold in their current coinage system for reasons of public health; whereas it seems desirable to reduce the nickel content of coins when moving to a new coinage system;
(12) Whereas it is therefore appropriate to follow in principle the proposal of the aforesaid mint directors and to adapt it only to the extent necessary to take into account in particular the specific requirements of important categories of coin users and the need to reduce the use of nickel in coins;
(13) Whereas of all prescribed technical specifications for euro coins, only the value for thickness is of an indicative nature, since actual thickness of a coin depends on prescribed diameter and weight,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 of 3 May 1998 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe first series of euro coins will include eight denominations in the range from 1 cent to 2 euro with the following technical specifications:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1999.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States, in accordance with the Treaty, subject to Article 109k(1) and Protocols 11 and 12.\n\nDone at Brussels, 3 May 1998.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nG.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 414/2004(2) adopted the measures required to identify in particular the traditional operators established in the Community who supplied the markets of the new Member States in 2000, 2001 and 2002, with a view to the measures to be adopted to adapt the arrangements for administering tariff quotas on banana imports as a result of the accession of new Member States on 1 May 2004.
(2) Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004 specifies the supporting documents which operators must supply to the competent authorities in order to be recognised as traditional operators. In view of the difficulties encountered by operators in obtaining copies of the documents held by other operators to attest that the products have actually been released for free circulation in the country of destination, additional supporting documents which may be produced should be specified. These documents should attest in particular that the products have been dispatched to the country of destination and have been sold to an operator to supply the market of the country concerned.
(3) The provisions of this Regulation are intended to take account of the transitional difficulties encountered by operators and may not prejudice any measures that might subsequently be adopted by the Commission for the purposes of administering the import arrangements in question.
(4) Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 414/2004, and Article 7 thereof relating to notifications from the Member States, should therefore be amended accordingly, and the new provisions should apply from the date of entry into force of that Regulation.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (1), and in particular Article 48(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 2002/72/EC (2) lays down specific provisions relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs, including compositional requirements, and restrictions and specifications for substances that may be used therein.
(2) Several notifications and alerts have been received by the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed pursuant to Article 50 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) concerning food contact materials imported into the Union from the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter ‘China’) and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter ‘Hong Kong’), releasing into food or food simulant amounts of chemicals that are not in compliance with the Union legislation.
(3) These notifications and alerts primarily concern polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware that does not comply with the requirements concerning the release of primary aromatic amines and formaldehyde into food as laid down in Part A of Annex V and Section A of Annex II to Directive 2002/72/EC respectively.
(4) Primary aromatic amines (hereinafter ‘PAA’) are a family of compounds, some of which are carcinogenic, while others of these compounds are suspected carcinogens. PAA may arise in materials intended for food contact as a result of the presence of impurities or breakdown products.
(5) Polyamide kitchenware originating in or consigned from China and Hong Kong has been reported to release high level of PAA into food.
(6) Directive 2002/72/EC authorises the use of formaldehyde in the manufacture of plastics, provided that these plastics do not release into food more than 15 mg/kg of formaldehyde (specific migration limit (SML) expressed as total formaldehyde and hexamethylenetetramine).
(7) Melamine kitchenware originating in or consigned from China and Hong Kong has been reported to release into food levels of formaldehyde that are higher than those authorised.
(8) In the past few years, in order to increase knowledge of the requirements set out in Union legislation concerning food contact materials imported into the Union, the Commission has taken several initiatives, including training sessions for Chinese control authorities and the industry concerned.
(9) Despite those initiatives, the missions of the Food and Veterinary Office to China and Hong Kong in 2009 identified serious deficiencies in the official control system regarding plastic food contact materials intended for importation into the Union and large quantities of controlled polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China and Hong Kong still do not fulfil the requirements of Union legislation.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) lays down specific provisions relating to the materials and articles intended to come into contact directly or indirectly with food, including certain general and specific requirements that these materials and articles should fulfil. Pursuant to Article 24 thereof, Member States shall carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with that Regulation in accordance with the relevant provisions of Union law relating to official food and feed controls. Those provisions are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(11) More specifically, Article 48(1) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 provides that in so far as Union legislation does not lay down the conditions and detailed procedures to be respected when importing goods from third countries, they may, if necessary, be laid down by the Commission.
(12) Article 48(2) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 provides for the possibility to impose specific import conditions on particular products coming from certain third countries, taking into account the risks associated with these products.
(13) In order to minimise the health risks that may arise from polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China or Hong Kong, each consignment of such products should be accompanied by appropriate documentation, including analytical results showing that it meets the requirements concerning the release of PAA and formaldehyde respectively, as laid down in Directive 2002/72/EC.
(14) In order to ensure a more efficient organisation of the controls of polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China or Hong Kong, the importers or their representatives should give prior notification of the arrival and of the nature of the consignments. Likewise, Member States should have the possibility to designate specific first points of introduction through which consignments of these articles may enter the Union. This information should be publicly available.
(15) In order to ensure a degree of uniformity at the Union level with regard to the controls of polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China or Hong Kong, the procedure for the official controls, as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, should be defined in this Regulation. These controls should include documentary, identity and physical checks.
(16) In the event of non-compliance being identified during the physical checks, Member States should immediately inform the Commission through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.
(17) Member States should have the possibility, in specific cases, to authorise the onward transportation of consignments of polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China or Hong Kong from the first point of introduction, provided arrangements are made with the competent authority at the point of destination to ensure the traceability of the consignments pending the results of the physical checks, in order to allow the competent authority to deal with the process of importing such consignments effectively and efficiently.
(18) The release into free circulation of polyamide and melamine plastic kitchenware originating in or consigned from China or Hong Kong should take place only once all the checks have been completed and the results are known. For that purpose the result of the controls should be made available to the customs authorities before the goods can be released for free circulation.
(19) A procedure for recording the information obtained from these controls should be established. This information should be submitted regularly to the Commission.
(20) The provisions of this Regulation should be periodically reviewed, taking into account the information received from the Member States.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 5 June 2014
on the protection of personal data in the European e-Justice Portal
(2014/333/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Whereas:
(1) In its communication of May 2008 (1), the Commission stated that it would design and set up the European e-Justice Portal (hereinafter ‘the Portal’), to be managed in close cooperation with the Member States.
(2) The Multi-annual European e-Justice Action Plan 2009–2013 (2) of 8 November 2008 entrusted the European Commission with the implementation of the Portal. The Portal was launched on 16 July 2010. The adoption of this Decision has become necessary only now since the Portal is only now ready for the first interconnection of national registers involving the processing of personal data.
(3) The Portal's objective is to contribute to the achievement of the European judicial area by facilitating and enhancing access to justice and leveraging information and communication technologies to facilitate cross-border electronic judicial proceedings and judicial cooperation.
(4) The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union as well as the Member States when they are implementing Union law must respect fundamental rights and observe the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data stipulated in Article 8 of that Charter.
(5) Since the various Portal-related tasks and functions of the Commission and the Member States will entail different responsibilities and obligations as regards data protection, it is essential to delimit them clearly.
(6) In accordance with the specific nature of activities linked to the e-Justice Portal, developed in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States, the role of the Commission in processing personal data through the Portal is limited. It should be clarified that the Commission has no responsibility for the content of interconnected national databases made available through the Portal.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) applies to the processing of personal data by the Commission in the Portal.

The Portal was launched on 16 July 2010. The adoption of this Decision has become necessary only now since the Portal is only now ready for the first interconnection of national registers involving the processing of personal data.\n\n((3)) The Portal's objective is to contribute to the achievement of the European judicial area by facilitating and enhancing access to justice and leveraging information and communication technologies to facilitate cross-border electronic judicial proceedings and judicial cooperation.\n\n((4)) The institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union as well as the Member States when they are implementing Union law must respect fundamental rights and observe the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to the protection of personal data stipulated in Article 8 of that Charter.\n\n((5)) Since the various Portal-related tasks and functions of the Commission and the Member States will entail different responsibilities and obligations as regards data protection, it is essential to delimit them clearly.\n\n((6)) In accordance with the specific nature of activities linked to the e-Justice Portal, developed in cooperation between the Commission and the Member States, the role of the Commission in processing personal data through the Portal is limited. It should be clarified that the Commission has no responsibility for the content of interconnected national databases made available through the Portal.\n\n((7)) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3)applies to the processing of personal data by the Commission in the Portal.

(1) Article 63 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 lays down the conditions for the application of the distillation arrangements for wines referred to in Article 29 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(4). Those arrangements provide for subsidised, voluntary distillation in order to support the wine market and help ensure continued supplies to the potable alcohol sector, which traditionally uses this type of alcohol. To that end, wine producers and distillers conclude contracts, which the Member States notify to the Commission twice a month.
(2) Article 63(6) lays down the conditions under which the Commission must intervene in the contract-approval procedure, setting a single percentage for acceptance of contracts concluded for distillation and/or suspending the notification of new contracts, notably where the available budgetary resources or the absorption capacity of the potable alcohol sector are exceeded or may be exceeded.
(3) For the 2001/02 wine year the Commission has, for budgetary reasons and bearing in mind the absorption capacity of the potable alcohol sector, set a limit of 7 million hl of table wine for the first tranche of contracts. On the basis of the quantities of wine for which the Member States notified new distillation contracts to the Commission on 5 November 2001, the Commission notes that that limit has been exceeded.

Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 laying down the rules for participation and dissemination in ‘Horizon 2020 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)’ and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1906/2006 (1), and in particular Article 1(3)(b) and points (i) to (vii) of Article 1(3)(c) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EU) No 1291/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) establishes the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (Horizon 2020) and provides for the involvement of the Union in public-private partnerships, including in joint undertakings, in key areas where research and innovation can contribute to the Union's wider competitiveness goals and help tackle societal challenges.
(2) Participation in indirect actions under Horizon 2020 should comply with Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013. However, in order to take into account the specific operating needs of joint undertakings established pursuant to Article 187 of the Treaty in the area of innovative medicines, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty was delegated to the Commission for the duration of Horizon 2020 with a view to allowing funding bodies established under Article 187 of the Treaty to limit the eligibility for funding to specific types of participants and to adopt specific intellectual property rules.
(3) The Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking was set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2008 (3) for a period up to 31 December 2017 in order to foster collaboration between all stakeholders such as industry, public authorities (including regulators), organisations of patients, universities and clinical centres and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug development process with the long term aim that the pharmaceutical sector produce more effective and safer innovative medicines.
(4) Specific operating needs, substantiated by the aim of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) to bring together large industrial partners with non-profits, public entities or other entities and to maximize exploitation of project results which could bring medicines to patients faster, have been identified as referring to eligibility for funding and intellectual property rules. The Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking set up by Council Regulation (EU) No 557/2014 (4) should continue to provide funding to entities such as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, secondary and higher education establishments, and non-profit organizations, therefore a derogation from Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 is necessary.
(5) Specific operating needs have been identified regarding intellectual property rules in the context of the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 objectives, in order to achieve an open innovation model, a dynamic system of knowledge sharing providing wider possibilities to create and exploit the knowledge resulted from the IMI projects and wide access of participants, affiliates and third parties to this knowledge, with the ultimate goal of speeding up the development of diagnostics and medical intervention for patients' benefit, including by stimulating clinical, translational research and clinical trials, in particular in the areas of public health interest and high unmet medical need, as identified in the World Health Organisation priority medicines report issued on 9 July 2013 (5). Those conditions should apply to all participants in order to protect their background, results and sideground. It is appropriate to allow for the transfer and licensing of results and background and for access rights to the results and background of other participants in order to allow research to be carried out.

However, in order to take into account the specific operating needs of joint undertakings established pursuant to Article 187 of the Treaty in the area of innovative medicines, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article\xa0290 of the Treaty was delegated to the Commission for the duration of Horizon 2020 with a view to allowing funding bodies established under Article 187 of the Treaty to limit the eligibility for funding to specific types of participants and to adopt specific intellectual property rules.\n\n((3)) The Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking was set up by Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2008(3)for a period up to 31 December 2017 in order to foster collaboration between all stakeholders such as industry, public authorities (including regulators), organisations of patients, universities and clinical centres and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the drug development process with the long term aim that the pharmaceutical sector produce more effective and safer innovative medicines.\n\n((4)) Specific operating needs, substantiated by the aim of the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) to bring together large industrial partners with non-profits, public entities or other entities and to maximize exploitation of project results which could bring medicines to patients faster, have been identified as referring to eligibility for funding and intellectual property rules. The Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking set up by Council Regulation (EU) No 557/2014(4)should continue to provide funding to entities such as micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, secondary and higher education establishments, and non-profit organizations, therefore a derogation from Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1290/2013 is necessary.\n\n((5)) Specific operating needs have been identified regarding intellectual property rules in the context of the Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 objectives, in order to achieve an open innovation model, a dynamic system of knowledge sharing providing wider possibilities to create and exploit the knowledge resulted from the IMI projects and wide access of participants, affiliates and third parties to this knowledge, with the ultimate goal of speeding up the development of diagnostics and medical intervention for patients' benefit, including by stimulating clinical, translational research and clinical trials, in particular in the areas of public health interest and high unmet medical need, as identified in the World Health Organisation priority medicines report issued on 9 July 2013(5). Those conditions should apply to all participants in order to protect their background, results and sideground.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 3,525 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 3806 of 17 December 1996;
Whereas the United Kingdom Government has submitted to the Commission on 2 August 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of the west Midlands; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the single programming document satisfies the conditions and includes the information required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/7 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of the United Kingdom;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council on substances that deplete the ozone layer(1), and in particular Article 4(4)(iv) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission has, during the course of the review provided for in Article 4(4)(iv) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000, and after consultation with Member States, government representatives of the States that will accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 and stakeholders, come to the following findings with regard to the use of halon 2402.
(2) The manufacture of halon 2402 in developed countries ceased on 1 January 1994 when the parties to the Montreal Protocol agreed to halt production in developed countries. Since that time, any halon 2402 required has had to be obtained from specialised storage facilities which have stored halon that has been replaced by alternatives.
(3) Halon 2402 has wide-ranging application in the States that will accede to the European Union on 1 May 2004 for fire and explosion suppression in the military and non-military sectors where it is used, for example, in nuclear facilities as well as terrestrial, marine and air transportation.
(4) The replacement of halon fire-fighting equipment with alternative fire protection agents needs to take into account the availability of technically and economically feasible alternatives or technologies that are acceptable from the point of view of environment and health. Refit activities to install equipment that does not rely on halon for fire and explosion protection in military applications needs to be scheduled in a way that avoids unacceptably compromising the defense capability of the States that will accede to the European Union. Special budgetary consideration and a period of time to convert to an alternative are often needed to adapt alternative fire-protection agents to perform safely and effectively.
(5) Article 4(4)(v) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 requires halon installed in equipment that is not listed as a critical use in Annex VII to have been decommissioned by 31 December 2003 and the halon recovered in accordance with Article 16. In order to qualify for a critical-use exemption that would allow the continued use of halon 2402 in the countries that will accede to the European Union after that date, Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should be amended to allow this fire-extinguishing agent to be used for a range of applications.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 should therefore be amended accordingly.

The second subparagraph of that Article lays down that the weight is to be adjusted on the basis of the moisture content laid down in Annex IV for the variety concerned up to a maximum of 4 %. Certain varieties of tobacco in groups II and III, cured by traditional air-drying methods in traditional dryers, are produced in regions which can have high levels of precipitation during the delivery period. Under these circumstances it is difficult to monitor the moisture content in traditional air-cured tobacco on delivery. The maximum moisture content for those varieties of tobacco should therefore be amended.
(2) Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 lays down that the production areas referred to in Article 5(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 are as laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2848/98. Portugal has asked the Commission to include the region of Beiras in the list of traditional recognised production areas for the production of tobaccos in group I.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),

Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty (3),
Whereas the Commission organised a broad public consultation on the basis of a Green Paper on a numbering policy for telecommunications services in Europe;
Whereas this consultation underlined the importance of equal quantitative and qualitative access to numbering resources for all market players and the crucial significance of adequate numbering mechanisms, in particular for number portability and carrier selection, as key facilitators of consumer choice and effective competition in a liberalised telecommunications environment;
Whereas the Council adopted a resolution (4) on 22 September 1997 inviting the Commission to submit proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council regarding the accelerated introduction of number portability and regarding the introduction of carrier preselection;
Whereas on 17 July 1997 the European Parliament adopted a resolution (5) calling on the Commission to submit a proposal for an amendment to an already existing directive with a view to introducing carrier pre-selection and number portability;
Whereas, in the interests of the consumer and taking into account specific national market situations, national regulatory authorities may extend the obligation to provide carrier pre-selection with call-by-call override to organisations operating public telecommunications networks without significant market power, where this does not impose a disproportionate burden on such organisations or create a barrier to entry in the market for new operators;
Whereas Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of open network provision (ONP) (6) should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'title': 'Directive 98/61/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 amending Directive 97/33/EC with regard to operator number portability and carrier pre-selection', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDirective 97/33/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1. the following definitions shall be added to Article 2(1):\n\n\'(h) ""subscriber"" means any natural or legal person who or which is party to a contract with the provider of publicly available telecommunications services for the supply of such services;\n\n(i) ""geographic number"" means a number from the national numbering plan where part of its digit structure contains geographic significance used for routing calls to the physical location of the network termination point of the subscriber to whom the number has been assigned;`\n\n2. the first subparagraph of Article 12(5) shall be replaced by the following:\n\n\'5.

For this purpose facilities shall be in place by 1 January 2000 at the latest or, in those countries which have been granted an additional transition period, as soon as possible thereafter, but no later than two years after any later date agreed for full liberalisation of voice telephony services, which allow the subscriber to choose these services by means of pre-selection with a facility to override any pre-selected choice on a call-by-call basis by dialling a short prefix.\n\nNational regulatory authorities shall ensure that pricing for interconnection related to the provision of this facility is cost-orientated and that direct charges to consumers, if any, do not act as a disincentive for the use of this facility.`\n\n4. the first sentence of Article 20(2) shall be replaced by the following:\n\n\'2.

Whereas, in the case of products originating in Vietnam, release for free circulation should be permitted of quantities actually shipped from that country with the Community as intended destination; whereas to that end the issuing of import licences must be made conditional on submission of an attestation issued by the exporting country; whereas it is necessary, however, to take into consideration the special position of goods that could not be imported under the arrangements in question in 1988 following particularly rapid exhaustion of the quantities available at that time and which were subsequently placed under customs warehousing or free zone procedures pending establishment by the Council of the quota for 1989; whereas in order to prevent deflections of trade adversely affecting satisfactory operation of the 1989 quota, those goods must have been placed under the abovementioned procedures before 1 January 1989;
Whereas, in the light of past experience and given the special situation described above, the lodging of applications for abnormally large quantities should be prevented by setting a maximum quantity per application and stipulating that in no case may applications cover a quantity greater than that held by the applicant; whereas for purposes of monitoring and general administrative efficiency applications for licences for goods placed under the abovementioned procedures must be submitted to the competent authorities of the Member State in which the goods are stored;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity(1), and in particular Article 4(1), thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Member States are to notify regulated interfaces, so that the equivalence between them can be established.
(2) Given that it is already known that certain radio equipment interfaces are equivalent from a regulatory perspective, the equivalence between such interfaces should be provisionally established pending notification of regulated interfaces.
(3) Experts from Member States and the sector have studied classification of interface regulations. From these studies it was concluded that it would not be in the interest of the consumer or surveillance authorities to have extensive classification or marking.
(4) Member States have not yet notified the interfaces regulated in their territories.
(5) Nonetheless a number of interfaces are known, notably those regulated through Common Technical Regulations adopted according to Directive 98/13/EC.
(6) It is appropriate to classify equipment which can be placed on the market in the whole of the Community and which can be put into service without restriction in a single class.
(7) It is appropriate for such equipment only to bear the CE mark.
(8) It is however in the interest of market surveillance authorities and consumers to be alerted through its Equipment Class Identifier where there are limitations to the placing on the market or the putting into service of radio equipment.
(9) Provisionally all equipment where there are such restrictions can be grouped in a single class.
(10) However further classes may be envisaged after Member States have notified regulated interfaces.
(11) It would be useful not to extensively describe classes in terms of equipment types in this Decision. The Commission will therefore, after consulting the Standing Committee of Directive 1999/5/EC (TCAM), publish and maintain on the web an indicative and non-exhaustive list of equipment per equipment class as guidance to manufacturers. Manufacturers are recommended to consult a notified body for products for which such guidance is not yet available.

Whereas:
(1) Directive 66/401/EEC provides for the maximum weight of a lot in the context of seed testing.
(2) Changes in seed marketing practices, in particular methods of transporting seed including bulk shipment, suggest that an increase in the maximum prescribed lot weight for seed of grasses may be desirable.
(3) Current international practice, namely the derogatory experiment on maximum lot size of gramineae seed, as adopted by the Council of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development on 28 September 2000, and the experiment on herbage seed lot size, approved at the ordinary meeting of the International Seed Testing Association of 21 June 2001, permits procedures whereby the maximum weight of a lot may be increased for certain species, including grasses.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) in conjunction with Article 218(9) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Action by the Union in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime safety.
(2) The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at its 64th session in October 2012 approved amendments to the Condition Assessment Scheme (Resolution MEPC.94(46)), arising from the adoption of the International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers 2011. Those amendments are expected to be adopted in the 65th session of the MEPC, to be held on 13 to 17 May 2013.
(3) The IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) meeting at its 91st session approved amendments to the International Safety Management (ISM) Code as well as amendments to Chapter III of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS), the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 and the Dynamically Supported Craft Code. Those amendments are expected to be adopted in the 92nd session of the MSC, to be held in June 2013.
(4) The amendments to the Condition Assessment Scheme (CAS) for single hull oil tankers will modify the CAS to refer to the latest (2011) Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers or Enhanced Survey Programme (ESP). Regulation (EU) No 530/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 on the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers (1) provides for the application of the CAS.
(5) The amendments to the ISM Code will introduce specific clarifications to that Code in terms of appropriate manning considerations and responsibility for ISM-related delegated tasks as well as the insertion of relevant footnotes. The ISM Code, although set out in an Annex to Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February 2006 on the implementation of the International Safety Management Code within the Community (2), is also defined in that Regulation as being ‘in its up-to-date version’. Regulation (EC) No 336/2006 requires that ships covered by it comply with the requirements of Part A of the ISM Code. Hence the changes to be adopted at the 92th session of the MSC will have a direct legal effect on that Regulation.
(6) The amendments to Chapter III of the SOLAS Convention with respect to the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 as well as to the Dynamically Supported Craft Code, will introduce into Regulation 19 of Chapter III of the SOLAS Convention, into Chapter 18 of the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 and into Chapter 17 of the Dynamically Supported Craft Code an obligation for rescue training for those crew members with responsibilities for working in enclosed spaces. Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships (3) specifically applies the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 to domestic high speed passenger craft. For older crafts for which those High Speed Craft Codes do not apply, that Directive applies the previous Dynamically Supported Craft Code.
(7) The amendments to be adopted at the 65th session of the MEPC and at the 92th session of the MSC can be considered positive developments and therefore should be given the Union’s support.
(8) The Union is neither a member of the IMO nor a contracting party to the conventions and codes concerned. It is therefore necessary for the Council to authorise the Member States to express the position of the Union in the MEPC and the MSC and express their consent to the bound by these amendments,","{'header': '7.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 155/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 13 May 2013\non the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union at the 65th session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee as regards amendments to the Condition Assessment Scheme and at the 92nd session of the Maritime Safety Committee as regards amendments to the International Safety Management Code as well as amendments to Chapter III of the SOLAS Convention and to the High Speed Craft Codes 1994 and 2000 concerning enclosed space entry and rescue drills\n(2013/267/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Action by the Union in the sector of maritime transport should aim to improve maritime safety.\n\n((2)) The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at its 64th session in October 2012 approved amendments to the Condition Assessment Scheme (Resolution MEPC.94(46)), arising from the adoption of the International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers 2011.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC(1) of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat and meat products from third countries, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(2), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 91/68/EEC(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(4), lays down the animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in ovine and caprine animals.
(2) Commission Decision 97/232/EC(5), as last amended by Decision 2003/111/EC(6), draws up lists of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of sheep and goats.
(3) Greenland was recognised as being in compliance with the requirements laid down in point II of Chapter 1 of Annex A to Directive 91/68/EEC and hence was recognised as a third country that had satisfied the criteria for official brucellosis-free status.
(4) Greenland has informed the Commission of its intention not to carry out random sampling for Brucellosis melitensis in ovine and caprine animals.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3648/90 of 11 December 1990 laying down general rules  for implementing the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal as regards the compensation mechanism  on exports of fruit and vegetables originating  (1), and in particular Aricle 4  (1) thereof,
Whereas, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3819/90  (2), lays down detalied rules for the application  of the compensation mechanism to imports of fruit and vegetables from Spain and Portugal;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 318 of the Act of Accession, a compensation mechanism is to be  introduced in imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, hereinafter referred  to as the 'Community of Ten`, from 1 January 1991, of fruit and vegetables from Portugal for which  a reference price is fixed with regard to third countries;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 318  (1)  (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price  is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each  Member State of the Community of Ten, plus transport and packaging costs incurred by the products  from the production regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and bearing  in mind developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetables sector; whereas the  abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years  preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community  offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied for third countries;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal variations in prices, the marketing year should be  made up of one or more periods and a Community offer price should be fixed for each of these;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3648/90, the producer prices to be  used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product  defined by its commercial characteristics recorded on the representative market or markets located  in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a  considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter  and which meet Quality Class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas  the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices  which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared with the normal fluctuations  recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive  variations with respect of normal price fluctuations, it shall not be taken into account;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 784/90 of 29 March fixing the reducing coefficient for  agricultural prices in the 1990/91 marketing year as a result of the monetary realignment of 5  January 1990 and amending the prices and amounts fixed in ecus for that marketing year  (3)  establishes the list of prices and amounts to which the coefficient 1,001712 is applied in the  framework of the arrangements on the automatic dismantlement of negative monetary gaps; whereas the  prices and amounts fixed in ecus by the Commission for the 1990/91 marketing year must take account  of the resulting reduction; whereas this reducing coefficient is to apply to the prices referred to  above;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices  applicable to Portugal being fixed for lemons, apples, pears, artichokes, cabbage lettuce,  broad-leaf (Batavian) endives, mandarins, clementines and sweet oranges for the period 1 January  1991 to the end of the 1990/91 marketing year;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 of 28 July 1993 laying down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1630/2000(4), provides in particular that cereals held by intervention agencies are to be sold by tendering procedure at prices preventing market disturbance.
(2) Sweden still has intervention stocks of barley.
(3) Because of the difficult weather conditions in much of the Community, cereal production has been significantly reduced in the 2003/04 marketing year. This situation has resulted in high prices locally, causing particular difficulties for livestock holdings and the feedingstuffs industry, which are finding it hard to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to make stocks of barley held by the Swedish intervention agency available on the internal market. As the quantities of barley placed on the Community market by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1514/2003(5) are now exhausted, it is necessary to open a new invitation to tender and to repeal that Regulation.
(5) To take account of the situation on the Community market, provision should be made for the Commission to manage this invitation to tender. In addition, provision must be made for an award coefficient for tenders offering the minimum selling price.
(6) When the Swedish intervention agency notifies the Commission, the tenderers should remain anonymous.
(7) With a view to modernising management, the information required by the Commission should be sent by electronic mail.
(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not issued an opinion by the time limit laid down by its Chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1965/2003 of 7 November 2003 opening a standing invitation to tender for the resale on the Community market of barley held by the Swedish intervention agency', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission at its annual meeting in September 2002 recommended a number of technical measures to minimise the catch of under-sized cod with the overall aim of rebuilding the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea. These measures were implemented by Council Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002 of 20 December 2002 fixing for 2003 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required(2).
(2) During the period of application of these measures, further scientific work has been completed and practical experience has been gained which imply that the measures adopted for the trawl fisheries for cod and flatfish do not have the effect foreseen and cod below the minimum size is caught and discarded to an extent that will reduce the cod stock.
(3) Current fishing practice constitutes a serious threat to the conservation and the rebuilding of the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and requires immediate action. It is therefore appropriate for the Commission to take, on its own initiative, emergency measures to protect the incoming year-classes of cod in the Baltic. These measures should apply from 15 April 2003 until 31 May 2003 in addition to the ban on fishing for cod between 1 June and 31 August laid down in Regulation (EC) No 2341/2002,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 677/2003 of 14 April 2003 establishing emergency measures for the recovery of the cod stock in the Baltic Sea', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFishing for cod with trawls, Danish seines and similar nets shall be prohibited from 15 April to 31 May 2003 for Community fishing vessels in ICES Division III b, c and d and fishing vessels flying the flag of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in the Community waters of ICES Division III b, c and d.\n\nFishing for flatfish with trawls, Danish seines and similar nets shall be prohibited from 15 April to 31 May 2003 for Community fishing vessels in ICES Division III b, c and d.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 15 April 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 14 April 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 59.\n\n(2) OJ L 356, 31.12.2002, p. 12.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences (1), and in particular Article 7a(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The minimum requirements for fitness to drive are not harmonised to the full extent. Member States are allowed to impose standards that are stricter than the minimum European requirements, as laid down in Annex III point 5 to Directive 91/439/EEC.
(2) Since the existence of different requirements in different Member States may affect the principle of free movement the Council specifically asked for a review of the medical standards for driver licensing set out in Annex III to Directive 91/439/EEC in its resolution of 26 June 2000.
(3) In line with this Council resolution, the Commission advised that medium- and long-term work should be undertaken in order to adapt Annex III to scientific and technical progress as laid down in Article 7a(2) of Directive 91/439/EEC.
(4) Eyesight, diabetes and epilepsy were identified as being medical conditions affecting fitness to drive which needed to be considered; to that end working groups comprised of specialists appointed by Member States were set up.
(5) These working groups produced reports with a view to updating the relevant points of Annex III to Directive 91/439/EEC.
(6) Directive 91/439/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Where there is reason to doubt that the applicant’s vision is adequate, he/she shall be examined by a competent medical authority. At this examination attention shall be paid, in particular, to the following: visual acuity, field of vision, twilight vision, glare and contrast sensitivity, diplopia and other visual functions that can compromise safe driving.\nFor group 1 drivers, licensing may be considered in “exceptional cases” where the visual field standard or visual acuity standard cannot be met; in such cases the driver should undergo examination by a competent medical authority to demonstrate that there is no other impairment of visual function, including glare, contrast sensitivity and twilight vision. The driver or applicant should also be subject to a positive practical test conducted by a competent authority.\nGroup 1:\n6.1.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence shall have a binocular visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,5 when using both eyes together.\nMoreover, the horizontal visual field should be at least 120 degrees, the extension should be at least 50 degrees left and right and 20 degrees up and down. No defects should be present within a radius of the central 20 degrees.\nWhen a progressive eye disease is detected or declared, driving licences may be issued or renewed subject to the applicant undergoing regular examination by a competent medical authority.\n6.2.\nApplicants for a driving licence, or for the renewal of such a licence, who have total functional loss of vision in one eye or who use only one eye (e.g. in the case of diplopia) must have a visual acuity of at least 0,5, with corrective lenses if necessary. The competent medical authority must certify that this condition of monocular vision has existed for a sufficiently long time to allow adaptation and that the field of vision in this eye meets the requirement laid down in paragraph 6.1.\n6.3.\nAfter any recently developed diplopia or after the loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period (for example six months), during which driving is not allowed. After this period, driving is only allowed following a favourable opinion from vision and driving experts.\nGroup 2:\n6.4.\nApplicants for a driving licence or for the renewal of such a licence shall have a visual acuity, with corrective lenses if necessary, of at least 0,8 in the better eye and at least 0,1 in the worse eye. If corrective lenses are used to attain the values of 0,8 and 0,1, the minimum acuity (0,8 and 0,1) must be achieved either by correction by means of glasses with a power not exceeding plus eight dioptres, or with the aid of contact lenses. The correction must be well tolerated.\nMoreover, the horizontal visual field with both eyes should be at least 160 degrees, the extension should be at least 70 degrees left and right and 30 degrees up and down. No defects should be present within a radius of the central 30 degrees.\nDriving licences shall not be issued to or renewed for applicants or drivers suffering from impaired contrast sensitivity or from diplopia.\nAfter a substantial loss of vision in one eye, there should be an appropriate adaptation period (for example six months) during which the subject is not allowed to drive. After this period, driving is only allowed after a favourable opinion from vision and driving experts.’;\n2.\npoint 10 is replaced by the following:\n‘DIABETES MELLITUS\n10.\nIn the following paragraphs, a severe hypoglycaemia means that the assistance of another person is needed and a recurrent hypoglycaemia is defined as a second severe hypoglycaemia during a period of 12 months.\nGroup 1:\n10.1.\nDriving licences may be issued to, or renewed for, applicants or drivers who have diabetes mellitus. When treated with medication, they should be subject to authorised medical opinion and regular medical review, appropriate to each case, but the interval should not exceed five years.\n10.2.\nDriving licences shall not be issued to, nor renewed for, applicants or drivers who have recurrent severe hypoglycaemia or/and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia. A driver with diabetes should demonstrate an understanding of the risk of hypoglycaemia and adequate control of the condition.\nGroup 2:\n10.3.\nConsideration may be given to the issuing/renewal of group 2 licences to drivers with diabetes mellitus. When treated with medication which carries a risk of inducing hypoglycaemia (that is, with insulin, and some tablets), the following criteria should apply:\n—\nno severe hypoglycaemic events have occurred in the previous 12 months,\n—\nthe driver has full hypoglycaemic awareness,\n—\nthe driver must show adequate control of the condition by regular blood glucose monitoring, at least twice daily and at times relevant to driving,\n—\nthe driver must demonstrate an understanding of the risks of hypoglycaemia,\n—\nthere are no other debarring complications of diabetes.\nMoreover, in these cases, such licences should be issued subject to the opinion of a competent medical authority and to regular medical review, undertaken at intervals of not more than three years.\n10.4.\nA severe hypoglycaemic event during waking hours, even unrelated to driving, should be reported and should give rise to a reassessment of the licensing status.’;\n3.\npoint 12 is replaced by the following:\n‘EPILEPSY\n12.\nEpileptic seizures or other sudden disturbances of the state of consciousness constitute a serious danger to road safety if they occur in a person driving a power-driven vehicle.\nEpilepsy is defined as having had two or more epileptic seizures, less than five years apart. A provoked epileptic seizure is defined as a seizure which has a recognisable causative factor that is avoidable.\nA person who has an initial or isolated seizure or loss of consciousness should be advised not to drive. A specialist report is required, stating the period of driving prohibition and the requested follow-up.\nIt is extremely important that the person’s specific epilepsy syndrome and seizure type are identified so that a proper evaluation of the person’s driving safety can be undertaken (including the risk of further seizures) and the appropriate therapy instituted. This should be done by a neurologist.\nGroup 1:\n12.1.\nDrivers assessed under group 1 with epilepsy should be under licence review until they have been seizure-free for at least five years.\nIf the person has epilepsy, the criteria for an unconditional licence are not met. Notification should be given to the licensing authority.\n12.2.\nProvoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a provoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking factor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to drive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion (the assessment should be, if appropriate, in accordance with other relevant sections of Annex III (e.g. in the case of alcohol or other co-morbidity).\n12.3.\nFirst or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a first unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive after a period of six months without seizures, if there has been an appropriate medical assessment. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner.\n12.4.\nOther loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be assessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving.\n12.5.\nEpilepsy: drivers or applicants can be declared fit to drive after a one-year period free of further seizures.\n12.6.\nSeizures exclusively in sleep: the applicant or driver who has never had any seizures other than seizures during sleep can be declared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for a period which must not be less than the seizure-free period required for epilepsy. If there is an occurrence of attacks/seizure arising while awake, a one-year period free of further event before licensing is required (see “Epilepsy”).\n12.7.\nSeizures without influence on consciousness or the ability to act: the applicant or driver who has never had any seizures other than seizures which have been demonstrated exclusively to affect neither consciousness nor cause any functional impairment can be declared fit to drive so long as this pattern has been established for a period which must not be less than the seizure-free period required for epilepsy. If there is an occurrence of any other kind of attacks/seizures a one-year period free of further event before licensing is required (see “Epilepsy”).\n12.8.\nSeizures because of a physician-directed change or reduction of anti-epileptic therapy: the patient may be advised not to drive from the commencement of the period of withdrawal and thereafter for a period of six months after cessation of treatment. Seizures occurring during physician-advised change or withdrawal of medication require three months off driving if the previously effective treatment is reinstated.\n12.9.\nAfter curative epilepsy surgery: see “Epilepsy”.\nGroup 2:\n12.10.\nThe applicant should be without anti-epileptic medication for the required period of seizure freedom. An appropriate medical follow-up has been done. On extensive neurological investigation, no relevant cerebral pathology was established and there is no epileptiform activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG and an appropriate neurological assessment should be performed after the acute episode.\n12.11.\nProvoked epileptic seizure: the applicant who has had a provoked epileptic seizure because of a recognisable provoking factor that is unlikely to recur at the wheel can be declared able to drive on an individual basis, subject to neurological opinion. An EEG and an appropriate neurological assessment should be performed after the acute episode.\nA person with a structural intra-cerebral lesion who has increased risk of seizures should not be able to drive vehicles of group 2 until the epilepsy risk has fallen to at least 2\xa0% per annum. The assessment should be, if appropriate, in accordance with other relevant sections of Annex III (e.g. in the case of alcohol).\n12.12.\nFirst or single unprovoked seizure: the applicant who has had a first unprovoked epileptic seizure can be declared able to drive once five years freedom from further seizures has been achieved without the aid of anti-epileptic drugs, if there has been an appropriate neurological assessment. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner.\n12.13.\nOther loss of consciousness: the loss of consciousness should be assessed according to the risk of recurrence while driving. The risk of recurrence should be 2\xa0% per annum or less.\n12.14.\nEpilepsy: 10 years freedom from further seizures shall have been achieved without the aid of anti-epileptic drugs. National authorities may allow drivers with recognised good prognostic indicators to drive sooner. This also applies in case of “juvenile epilepsy”.\nCertain disorders (e.g. arterio-venous malformation or intra-cerebral haemorrhage) entail an increased risk of seizures, even if seizures have not yet occurred. In such a situation an assessment should be carried out by a competent medical authority; the risk of having a seizure should be 2\xa0% per annum or less to allow licensing.’'}]}"

(1) Under the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community Article 35 Member States are obliged to establish facilities to carry out continuous monitoring of the radioactivity in the environment on their territory, and the Commission has the right of access to such facilities.
(2) The European Commission has, in this context, developed a common data format called EURDEP (EUropean Radiological Data Exchange Platform) as well as an appropriate Internet based network in order to facilitate continuous and seamless exchange of data provided by the national automatic dose rate monitoring networks and the environment radiation surveillance programmes, that have been in use in the European Atomic Energy Community for several years and are now considered mature enough for expansion.
(3) The European Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have expressed a mutual determination to significantly reinforce the quality and intensity of their cooperation in a Joint Statement signed in 2008.
(4) Radiation protection, including making worldwide real time radiation monitoring data available, has been identified as one of the specific priority areas of cooperation.
(5) Using the proven technology developed by the European Commission for EURDEP is an excellent way to facilitate automatic exchange of data, and represents an important contribution to the global development of environmental radioactivity monitoring.
(6) Making EURDEP technology available to the IAEA is in the European Atomic Energy Community’s interest, since through the IAEA contribution the European network participants will have access to the environmental radioactivity monitoring data from all over the world.
(7) In this context, the present Memorandum of Understanding has been developed, in the context of the relations between Euratom and the IAEA, to cover the technical aspects of the cooperation between the IAEA and Euratom on EURDEP.
(8) No financial implications or legal obligations are incurred on the basis of the present Memorandum of Understanding,","{'header': '16.7.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(2), and in particular the second and third indents of Article 33(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 33(3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that the losses resulting from the obligation to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered by production levies on the production of A and B sugar, of A and B isoglucose and of inulin syrup A and B within certain limits.
(2) Article 33(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that, where the receipts expected from the basic production levy and the B levy, which must not exceed 2 % and 30 % respectively of the intervention price for white sugar for that marketing year, may well fail to cover the foreseeable total loss for the current marketing year, the maximum percentage of the B levy is to be adjusted to the extent necessary to cover the said total loss but without exceeding 37,5 %.
(3) The foreseeable receipts, before adjustment, of the levies to be collected in respect of the 2000/01 marketing year are below the equivalent of the average loss multiplied by the exportable surplus. Therefore, in the light of the data at present available, the maximum amount of the B levy for 2000/01 should be raised to 37,5 % of the intervention price for the white sugar concerned.
(4) The second subparagraph of Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 provides that, subject to Article 33 of that Regulation, the minimum price for B beet is 68 % of the basic price for beet. Article 33(5) of the Regulation provides that the revised maximum percentage for the B levy should be fixed for the current marketing year before 15 September of the marketing year, together with the corresponding adjustment of the minimum price for B beet set for the 2000/01 marketing year by way of Council Regulation (EC) No 1364/2000(3).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products (1) and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 16(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2) provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3) shall apply as regards exports of products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty.
(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods’ arrival at destination.
(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(4) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 (4), which was signed in October 2004, is provisionally applicable from 1 February 2005 by virtue of Council Decision 2005/45/EC of 22 December 2004 concerning the conclusion and the provisional application of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation amending the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 as regards the provisions applicable to processed agricultural products (5).
(5) Pursuant to Decision 2005/45/EC exports of certain processed agricultural goods to Switzerland and Liechtenstein are, from 1 February 2005, no longer eligible for export refunds, unless the Community decides to introduce such refunds when the Swiss domestic reference price is lower than the Community’s domestic reference price.
(6) Decision 2005/45/EC introduces special provisions on administrative cooperation aimed at combating irregularities and fraud in customs and export refund related matters.
(7) In the light of those provisions and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds.

Whereas:
(1) A Commission expert has conducted an inspection visit to the Socialist Republic of Vietnam to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The provisions of legislation of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam make the National Fisheries Inspection and Quality Assurance Centre (Nafiqacen) responsible for inspecting the health of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods and for monitoring the hygiene and sanitary conditions of production. The same legislation empowers Nafiqacen to authorise or prohibit the harvesting of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods from certain zones.
(3) Nafiqacen and its laboratories are capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
(4) The competent authorities of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have undertaken to communicate regularly and quickly to the Commission data on the presence of plankton containing toxins in the harvesting zones.
(5) The competent authorities of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam have provided official assurances regarding compliance with the requirements specified in Chapter V of the Annex to Directive 91/492/EEC and with requirements equivalent to those prescribed in that Directive for the classification of production and relaying zones, approval of dispatch and purification centres and public health control and production monitoring.

(2) In joined Cases C-410/08 to C-412/08 Swiss Caps AG v Hauptzollamt Singen
 (4), the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that products presented in capsules and intended for use as a food supplement should be classified under heading 2106, as food preparations not elsewhere specified or included.

(1) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the possibility of a crisis distillation measure in the event of exceptional market disturbance due to major surpluses. Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production, and may apply to quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) at the request of the Member State concerned.
(2) The Greek Government has requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wines produced in Greece and for quality wines psr.
(3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the market in table wines and quality wines psr in Greece, which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the current marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend, and so remedy the difficult market situation, stocks of Greek wine should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements.
(4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied, a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 370 000 hectolitres of table wine and 130 000 hectolitres of quality wines psr.
(5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms (2) as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.

(6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with while allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure.
(7) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only, for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.

Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances.\n\n((6)) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with while allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure.\n\n((7)) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only, for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Wine,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nCrisis distillation as provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 is hereby opened for a maximum of 370\xa0000 hectolitres of table wines and 130\xa0000 hectolitres of quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) in Greece, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 concerning this type of distillation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nProducers may conclude contracts as provided for in Article 65 of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 (hereinafter referred to as the contract) from 18 July 2006 to 31 August 2006.\nContracts shall be accompanied by proof that a security equal to EUR 5 per hectolitre has been lodged.\nContracts may not be transferred.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0If the total quantities covered by the contracts submitted to the intervention agency exceed the quantities laid down in Article 1, Greece shall determine the rates of reduction to be applied to those contracts.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Greece shall take the administrative steps necessary to approve the contracts not later than 15 September 2006.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
I. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(a) Imposition of definitive anti-dumping duty
(1) In February 1988 the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of small screen colour television receivers (hereafter referred to as SCTVs) originating in the Republic of Korea (2). This followed a complaint lodged by the  European Association of Consumer Electronic Manufacturers (EACEM), representing a major proportion of Community production. Following an investigation, a provisional anti-dumping duty was imposed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3232/89 (3), and a  definitive duty was subsequently imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 (4).
(b) General duty
(2) Under Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90, duties of between 10,2 and 10,5 % were imposed on imports from three exporters cooperating in the investigation.
(3) The duty applicable to other Korean exporters (hereafter referred to as the 'general duty') and in particular to one exporter who refused to cooperate in the investigation and who was known to have exported large quantities of the product concerned  to the Community, was established on the basis of what were considered to be the most appropriate facts available, i.e. by comparing an export price based on the average cif unit price of imports into the Community from Korea with a normal value based  on the average domestic selling price of the cooperating Korean exporters. The margin thus established was 19,6 %.
II. REVIEW PROCEDURE
(4) In November 1990, the Commission received information from the Electronic Industries Association of Korea (EIAK) to the effect that the non-cooperating exporter mentioned above was no longer exporting SCTVs to the European Community. It was alleged  that this changed situation removed the justification for the 19,6 % general duty and suggested that it should be reduced to the level of the highest duty imposed on imports of a cooperating exporter (i.e. 10,5 %).
(5) After consulting the Advisory Committee, the Commission decided that there was sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a partial review, limited in scope to the question of whether or not to modify the general duty. The partial review was  opened on the initiative of the Commission, in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, by a notice pubished in the Official Journal of the European Communities (5).
(6) The Commission officially advised EIAK, the exporters who cooperated in the original investigation, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant in the original proceeding (EACEM), and gave the parties concerned the opportunity  to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(7) EIAK, some exporters and EACEM made their views known in writing.
(8) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of this proceeding and in particular received and verified to the extent necessary information from EIAK.
III. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(a) Determination of general duty in original anti-dumping investigation
(9) As is stated by the Commission in recital 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 3232/89 (imposing the provisional duty), for those Korean exporters who did not make themselves known during the course of the original investigation, dumping was determined on the  basis of what were considered by the Commission to be the most appropriate facts available, in accordance with Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
(10) For these non-cooperating exporters, the Commission calculated the dumping margin by comparing an export price based on the average cif unit price of imports into the Community from Korea (according to 1987 Eurostat data) with a normal value based  on the average domestic selling price of the cooperating Korean exporters. The resulting dumping margin of 19,6 % became that applicable to the non-cooperating exporters and was imposed as the general duty, while the imports of the three cooperating  Korean exporters (Daewoo, Goldstar and Samsung) are subject to definitive anti-dumping duties of 10,2 %, 10,4 % and 10,5 % respectively.
(11) The major reason why the Commission did not consider the highest duty imposed on imports from a cooperating exporter to be appropriate for the non-cooperating exporters was the behaviour of one particular manufacturer based in Korea. This company  was known to be exporting large quantities of SCTVs to the Community, with many of them being transhipped via third countries. It was approached by the Commission during its on-the-spot investigation, with the assistance of EIAK, with a view to securing  its cooperation. However, the company refused to cooperate.
(12) The Commission decided, and the Council confirmed, that, in these circumstances, neither the dumping margins determined for the cooperating exporters nor the information contained in the complaint provided the most appropriate basis for determining  the margin of dumping for non-cooperating exporters.
(b) Changed trade situation
(13) The 19,6 % general duty was imposed on the basis of the facts available for the original investigation period - 1987. In view of the information received from EIAK and other sources, it is clear that the trade situation concerning the above  exporter has now changed considerably.
(i) Information from EIAK
(14) According to EIAK's internal statistics, and independent data obtained from the Korean Foreign Trade Association, both of which were verified by the Commission, the exporter in question has not exported SCTVs to the Community since 1988.  Furthermore, its total exports from Korea of SCTVs to all destinations in 1990 amounted to only 3 % of the 1988 volume.
(15) EIAK supplied evidence that the exporter involved had shifted its production capacity away from colour TV/receivers to other electronic products.
(16) The exporter, which is a member of EIAK, had supplied the Association with a signed declaration that it no longer planned to export SCTVs to the Community. Furthermore, it was established that it had converted its production facilities to the  manufacture of other electronic products.
(ii) Information from Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry
(17) In May 1991, the Korean Ministry of Trade and Industry certified to the Commission that the exporter had now ceased all production of SCTVs in Korea, and provided appropriate documentary evidence.
(c) Imports from other non-cooperating exporters
(18) The Commission also established that the export volumes of other non-cooperating exporters were extremely small, even before the imposition of the anti-dumping duty.
(d) Conclusion
(19) In view of these changed circumstances, the Council concludes that the situation which justified the use of a different basis from that applied to the cooperating exporters for the purpose of imposing an anti-dumping duty no longer exists. The  exporter mentioned in recitals 13 to 17 has now ceased production of SCTVs in Korea and therefore the quantities exported to the Community by non-cooperating exporters can only be very small. In these circumstances, the appropriate level for the general  duty should be the highest rate of anti-dumping duty imposed on imports from a cooperating exporter, i.e. 10,5 %.
(20) This rate of duty does not act as an incentive to circumvention, nor as a reward for non-cooperation, but constitutes an equitable response to the changed trade situation.
(21) The parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations upon which the findings were based and were granted a period within which to make representations to the Commission. Where appropriate, their comments were taken into  consideration. EACEM requested, and was granted, an opportunity to be heard by the Commission with regard to its findings in this proceeding.
IV. AMENDMENT TO REGULATION (EEC) No 1048/90
(22) Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 should therefore be amended to reduce the general anti-dumping duty from 19,6 to 10,5 %, with effect from the date of entry into force of the present Regulation.
(23) This measure shall lapse on the same day as the definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2900/91 of 1 October 1991 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 with regard to the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of small screen colour television receivers originating in the Republic of Korea', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nIn Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 '19,6 %' shall be replaced by '10,5 %'.\n\nThe remainder of Regulation (EEC) No 1048/90 shall remain unchanged.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on port State control (1), and in particular Article 27 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Company performance is one of the generic parameters determining the risk profile of a ship.
(2) In order to assess company performance, the deficiency and detention rates of all ships in a company’s fleet, which have been subject to an inspection within the Union and within the region covered by the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on port State control (Paris MoU), should be taken into account.
(3) The implementing rules to calculate the company performance criteria for the ship risk profile as well as the methodology for drawing up the lists for publication are set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 802/2010 of 13 September 2010 implementing Article 10(3) and Article 27 of Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards company performance (2).
(4) Simulations of the publication of the lists based on the information recorded in the inspection database demonstrate that the methodology for publication set out in Regulation (EU) No 802/2010 should be more targeted.
(5) Therefore in order to make the lists of companies with a low or very low performance relevant it is necessary to amend the criteria used for drawing these lists to focus publication on the poorest performing companies. This should not change the computation of the company performance calculation for the ship risk profile.
(6) To be listed on the lists of low and very low performing companies the company should have demonstrated a level of poor performance for a continuous period of 36 months directly preceding the publication. A consistently poor performance for such an extended period demonstrates an unwillingness or inability on the part of the company to improve performance. As publication on the lists is based on the processing of the data corresponding to the performance of the companies for 36 months, sufficient time should be provided before the first publication in order to gather in the THETIS database sufficient data reported by the Member States in accordance with Directive 2009/16/EC.
(7) The companies to be listed are exclusively determined on the basis of the information transferred and validated by the Member States in the inspection database, in conformity with Article 24(3) of Directive 2009/16/EC. This information includes inspections of the ships, deficiencies identified during the inspections and detentions. It also includes the ship information (name, IMO identification number, call sign and flag) as well as the name of the owner or person such as the manager or bareboat charterer, who has assumed the responsibility for the operation of the ship as well as the duties and responsibilities imposed by the International Safety Management (ISM) Code. In this way the performance of a company and of the vessels for which it is responsible can be automatically monitored in the inspection database and the lists can be updated on a daily basis.
(8) The Commission should be able to retrieve from the inspection database, using its automatic functionalities, the relevant data in order to determine the companies to be included on the list of companies with a low and very low performance.
(9) The methodology for determining the company performance matrix is based on the processing of the detention index and the deficiency index of the company as provided for in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 802/2010.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 27 April 2009
on the existence of an excessive deficit in France
(2009/414/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by France,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of the said Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that in particular the economic and budgetary background was taken fully into account in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4), the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in France. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of France on 24 March 2009 (3).
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of France, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(7) According to the data notified by the French authorities on 6 February 2009, the general government deficit in France reached 3,2 % of GDP in 2008 (4), thus exceeding the 3 % of GDP reference value. The Commission report under Article 104(3) considers that the deficit was close to the 3 % of GDP reference value but that the excess over the reference value cannot be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact with GDP growth estimated to have attained 0,7 % of GDP in 2008, after 2,2 % in 2007. The excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission services January 2009 interim forecast, the general government deficit is forecast to reach 5,4 % of GDP in 2009 and, on a no-policy change basis, to decline only slightly to 5 % in 2010 as the budgetary impact of the recovery plan is phased out. Therefore the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) if the double condition – that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary – is fully met. In the case of France, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '30.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 135/19', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 27 April 2009\non the existence of an excessive deficit in France\n(2009/414/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

Therefore the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.\n\n((8)) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) if the double condition – that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary – is fully met. In the case of France, this double condition is not met.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community (‘Overseas Association Decision’) (1), and in particular Article 37 of Annex III thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 15 November 2007 the Commission adopted Decision 2007/767/EC (2) derogating from the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ to take account of the special situation of the Falkland Islands with regard to various species of frozen fish of CN heading 0303, various species of frozen fish fillets of CN heading 0304 and frozen Loligo squid and Illex squid of CN heading 0307. That derogation expired on 30 November 2012.
(2) On 12 October 2012 the Falkland Islands requested a new derogation from the rules of origin set out in Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC for the period from 1 December 2012 until the adoption of the new Overseas Association Decision. This request covers a total quantity of 8 750 tonnes of frozen fish of CN heading 0303, 1 683 tonnes of frozen fish fillets of CN heading 0304, 29 400 tonnes of frozen Loligo squid and 15 500 tonnes of frozen Illex squid of CN heading 0307.
(3) The Falkland Islands have based their request on the fact that domestic labour constraints and skill shortages limit the extent to which vessels can be crewed by Falkland Islanders. The fact that not all specific fishing expertise required is currently available from crew from the OCTs, the Community or ACP States stems in particular from the specific geographical situation of the Falkland Islands.
(4) The derogation from the rules of origin set out in Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC should be granted for products falling within CN headings 0303 and 0304, Loligo squid of CN code 0307 49 35 and Illex squid of CN code 0307 99 11. This derogation is justified under Article 37(1) of that Annex, in particular as regards the development of an existing local industry.
(5) It is necessary to ensure continuity of importations from the Falkland Islands to the Union. Decision 2007/767/EC should therefore be prolonged with effect from 1 December 2012 until the entry into force of the new Overseas Association Decision which is foreseen to take place on 1 January 2014.
(6) Decision 2007/767/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '20.12.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 350/97', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 December 2012\namending Decision 2007/767/EC as regards the derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Council Decision 2001/822/EC as regards certain fishery products imported from the Falkland Islands\n(notified under document C(2012) 9408)\n(2012/806/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 15 November 2007 the Commission adopted Decision 2007/767/EC(2)derogating from the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ to take account of the special situation of the Falkland Islands with regard to various species of frozen fish of CN heading 0303, various species of frozen fish fillets of CN heading 0304 and frozenLoligosquid and Illex squid of CN heading 0307.

amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include buprofezin as active substance
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included buprofezin. By Commission Decision 2008/771/EC (4) it was decided not to include buprofezin in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(3) The application was submitted to the United Kingdom, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 33/2008. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as those that were the subject of Decision 2008/771/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(4) The United Kingdom evaluated the new information and data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report in August 2009. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 21 August 2009.
(5) The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the additional report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority. The Authority then presented its conclusion on buprofezin to the Commission on 21 May 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 23 November 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for buprofezin.
(6) The additional report by the rapporteur Member State and the new conclusion by the Authority concentrate on the concerns that lead to the non-inclusion. Those concerns were, in particular, the impossibility to perform a reliable consumer exposure assessment because of lack of data to determine an appropriate residue definition.
(7) The new information submitted by the applicant enabled a consumer exposure assessment. The information currently available indicates that the risk to consumers is acceptable.
(8) Consequently, the additional data and information provided by the applicant permit to eliminate the specific concerns that led to the non-inclusion. No other open scientific questions have arisen.
(9) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing buprofezin may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include buprofezin in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(10) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain confirmatory information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that the inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information to confirm the processing and conversion factors in the consumer risk assessment.
(11) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(12) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '21.1.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 18/38', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2011/6/EU\nof 20 January 2011\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include buprofezin as active substance\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Whereas point 8 of the second paragraph of Article 4 of Council Directive 65/65/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 83/570/EEC (5), provides that various types of proof of the safety and efficacy of a proprietary medicinal product may be put forward in an application for marketing authorization depending upon the objective situation of the proprietary medicinal product in question;
Whereas experience has shown that it is advisable to stipulate more precisely the cases in which the results of pharmacological and toxicological tests or clinical trials do not have to be provided with a view to obtaining authorization for a proprietary medicinal product which is essentially similar to an authorized product, while ensuring that innovative firms are not placed at a disadvantage;
Whereas additional details were provided in respect of the application of the abovementioned provision by Council Directive 75/318/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to analytical, pharmaco-toxicological and clinical standards and protocols in respect of the testing of proprietary medicinal products (6), as last amended by Directive 87/19/EEC (7);
Whereas, however, there are reasons of public policy for not conducting repetitive tests on humans or animals without over-riding cause;
Whereas it is also advisable to make the packaging of certain proprietary medicinal products, particularly sought after by drug addicts, less distinctive by removing the obligation to place a special mark on the outer packaging and the container of proprietary medicinal products classified as narcotics;
Whereas the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic should have additional time to transpose this Directive so that they may as a priority complete the review of old proprietary medicinal products as provided for in Article 39 of the Council Directive 75/319/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to proprietary medicinal products (8) as last amended by Directive 83/570/EEC,","{'title': 'Council Directive 87/21/EEC of 22 December 1986 amending Directive 65/65/EEC on the approximation of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action relating to proprietary medicinal products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nDirective 65/65/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas under schedule CXL the Community undertook to open an annual import tariff quota of 169 000 head of young male bovine animals for fattening; whereas the rules of application for that quota for the period 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 must be established;
Whereas the supply requirements of certain regions of the Community which have a serious shortfall in bovine animals for fattening should be taken into account; whereas, as those requirements are apparent particularly in Italy and Greece, priority should be given to satisfying demand in those two Member States;
Whereas a method of management should be applied which is comparable to that used in the past for corresponding quotas, involving, in particular, a continuation of the method of allocation between traditional importers and traders furnishing proof of active involvement in trade in live animals with third countries;
Whereas it should be stipulated that the arrangements are to be managed using import licences; whereas to this end rules should be laid down on submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where applicable by way of derogation from certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for certain agricultural products (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 495/97 (3), and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 266/97 (5);
Whereas the application of this tariff quota requires strict surveillance of imports and effective checks as to their use and destination; whereas, therefore, importation must take place into the Member State which issued the import licence;
Whereas a security should be lodged in order to guarantee that the animals are fattened for at least 120 days in designated production units; whereas the amount of the security should be fixed taking into account the difference between the customs duties applicable inside and outside the quota;

of 23 June 2008
amending Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and establishing national restructuring programmes for the cotton sector
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 37(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of 1979, and in particular paragraph 6 of Protocol 4 on cotton (1) annexed thereto, hereinafter ‘Protocol 4’,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas:
(1) Chapter 10a of Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers (4) as inserted by Article 1(20) of Council Regulation (EC) No 864/2004 (5) sets out rules for the specific crop payment for cotton.
(2) By judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities of 7 September 2006 in case C-310/04 (6) Chapter 10a of Title IV of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 was annulled for breach of the principle of proportionality, in particular with reference to the circumstance that ‘the Council, the author of Regulation (EC) No 864/2004, [had] not shown before the Court that in adopting the new cotton support scheme established by that Regulation it actually exercised its discretion, involving the taking into consideration of all the relevant factors and circumstances of the case, including all the labour costs linked to cotton growing and the viability of the ginning undertakings, which it was necessary to take into account for assessing the profitability of that crop’ and that the Court had not been enabled ‘to ascertain whether the Community legislature [had been] able, without exceeding the bounds of the broad discretion it enjoys in the matter, to reach the conclusion that fixing the amount of the specific aid for cotton at 35 % of the total existing aid under the previous support scheme would suffice to guarantee the objective set out in recital 5 in the preamble to Regulation (EC) No 864/2004, namely to ensure the profitability and hence the continuation of that crop, an objective reflecting that laid down in paragraph 2 of Protocol 4’. The Court also ordered that the effects of the annulment be suspended until the adoption, within a reasonable time, of a new Regulation.
(3) A new scheme of specific payment for cotton needs to be adopted in conformity with the Court’s judgement in case C-310/04.
(4) All the relevant factors and circumstances pertaining to the specific situation of the cotton sector, including all the elements necessary to assess the profitability of that crop, should be taken into consideration. To this end, an evaluation and consultation process was launched: two studies were carried out on the socioeconomic and on the environmental impact on the cotton sector in the Community of the future cotton support scheme and specific seminars and an Internet consultation were organised with stakeholders.
(5) The new scheme should meet the objectives set out in paragraph 2 of Protocol 4: to support the production of cotton in regions of the Community where it is important for the agricultural economy, to permit the producers concerned to earn a fair income, and to stabilise the market by structural improvements at the level of supply and marketing.
(6) The scheme should also be consonant with a policy of income support for farmers, which is the main guiding principle of the reformed common agricultural policy (CAP).
(7) The de-coupling of direct producer support and the introduction of the single payment scheme are essential elements in the process of reforming the CAP. Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 introduced those elements for several agricultural products.
(8) In order to meet the objectives underlying the reform of the CAP as well as the objectives set out in Protocol 4, the support for cotton should be largely de-coupled and integrated into the single payment scheme. Since those objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need for common action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(9) The complete and immediate integration into the single payment scheme of the support scheme in the cotton sector is likely to bring a significant risk of production disruption to the cotton producer regions of the Community. Part of the support should therefore continue to be linked to the cultivation of cotton through a crop-specific payment per eligible hectare. Its amount should be calculated in such a way as to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 2 of Protocol 4 while also bringing the cotton scheme into the mainstream of the CAP reform simplification process. To that end, in the light of the evaluation carried out, it is justified that the total available aid per Member State is set at 35 % of the national share of the aid that went indirectly to the producers. Such a rate allows the cotton sector to move towards long-term viability, promotes the sustainable development of the cotton-producing regions and ensures a fair income for farmers.
(10) The remaining 65 % of the national share of the aid that went indirectly to the producers should be available for the single payment scheme.
(11) For environmental reasons, a base area per producer Member State should be established. In addition, the eligible areas should be restricted to those authorised by the Member States.
(12) A fixed yield per hectare should be established per producer Member State. It will determine, together with the base area requirement, the overall capping of the funds and the mainly decoupled nature of the scheme, the programme production limiting character while at the same time fulfilling the objectives of Protocol 4.
(13) In order to meet the needs of the ginning industry eligibility for the aid should be related to a minimum quality of cotton actually harvested.
(14) Furthermore, the establishment of inter-branch organisations, to be approved by the Member States, should be encouraged to allow producers and ginners to enhance the quality of the cotton. The Community should contribute indirectly to the activities of those organisations by increasing the aid to those farmers who are members of the organisations.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(16) Besides the new regime on the specific payment for cotton, it would seem appropriate to adopt another set of rules with the purpose of helping the cotton sector to stabilise in the new legal and market context.
(17) To the extent that the presence of the ginning industry appears necessary in the producer regions, the needs of that industry would be sufficiently satisfied, inter alia, by means of setting a minimum quality of cotton actually harvested and by allowing inter-branch organisations to enhance the quality of cotton. Moreover, considering the significant over-capacity of the ginning industry, it is appropriate to provide for additional measures to support their restructuring process with a view to improved market orientation.
(18) Furthermore, it seems appropriate that market orientation measures supporting specific quality schemes and related promotion activities be introduced. Therefore, national programmes for restructuring in the cotton sector should be established. While the relevant measures should be financed by the Community, it should be left to Member States to select the right mix for the needs of their respective constituencies, taking regional particularities into account, where necessary.
(19) The restructuring programmes should be submitted to the Commission for verification of the compliance of the measures with the conditions laid down in this Regulation and its implementing rules. Member States should be responsible for the implementation of such restructuring programmes.
(20) The measures should be complementary to already existing measures in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (7).
(21) The measures in such programmes may include the full and permanent dismantling of part of the ginning processing facilities to ensure a more viable ginning industry. Support may also be provided for investments in the ginning industry, geared towards improving the economic performance of the enterprises as such. Furthermore, aid may be made available to machinery contractors affected as a consequence of the restructuring of the cotton sector.
(22) To enhance the quality of European cotton, farmers who participate in specific quality schemes should receive, in the framework of such programmes, specific support to cover some of the related costs. Equally, information and promotion actions for cotton covered by these quality schemes should be supported.
(23) The allocation of the funds for the national restructuring programmes among Member States should be based on the specific needs for restructuring and adaptation in the main cotton production regions. In view of the temporary aim to restructure and adapt the cotton sector, the programmes may be terminated on request of the Member States, after which the annual budget for restructuring programmes may be added to the national ceiling of the Member State concerned for decoupled payments as established in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.
(24) In view of the absence of ginning industry in Portugal and the application of the Single Area Payment Scheme in Bulgaria, there is no need to allocate budget to national programmes for restructuring in these two Member States.

The Court also ordered that the effects of the annulment be suspended until the adoption, within a reasonable time, of a new Regulation.\n\n((3)) A new scheme of specific payment for cotton needs to be adopted in conformity with the Court’s judgement in case C-310/04.\n\n((4)) All the relevant factors and circumstances pertaining to the specific situation of the cotton sector, including all the elements necessary to assess the profitability of that crop, should be taken into consideration. To this end, an evaluation and consultation process was launched: two studies were carried out on the socioeconomic and on the environmental impact on the cotton sector in the Community of the future cotton support scheme and specific seminars and an Internet consultation were organised with stakeholders.\n\n((5)) The new scheme should meet the objectives set out in paragraph 2 of Protocol 4: to support the production of cotton in regions of the Community where it is important for the agricultural economy, to permit the producers concerned to earn a fair income, and to stabilise the market by structural improvements at the level of supply and marketing.\n\n((6)) The scheme should also be consonant with a policy of income support for farmers, which is the main guiding principle of the reformed common agricultural policy (CAP).\n\n((7)) The de-coupling of direct producer support and the introduction of the single payment scheme are essential elements in the process of reforming the CAP. Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 introduced those elements for several agricultural products.\n\n((8)) In order to meet the objectives underlying the reform of the CAP as well as the objectives set out in Protocol 4, the support for cotton should be largely de-coupled and integrated into the single payment scheme. Since those objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need for common action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n((9)) The complete and immediate integration into the single payment scheme of the support scheme in the cotton sector is likely to bring a significant risk of production disruption to the cotton producer regions of the Community. Part of the support should therefore continue to be linked to the cultivation of cotton through a crop-specific payment per eligible hectare. Its amount should be calculated in such a way as to achieve the objectives set out in paragraph 2 of Protocol 4 while also bringing the cotton scheme into the mainstream of the CAP reform simplification process. To that end, in the light of the evaluation carried out, it is justified that the total available aid per Member State is set at 35\xa0% of the national share of the aid that went indirectly to the producers. Such a rate allows the cotton sector to move towards long-term viability, promotes the sustainable development of the cotton-producing regions and ensures a fair income for farmers.\n\n((10)) The remaining 65\xa0% of the national share of the aid that went indirectly to the producers should be available for the single payment scheme.\n\n((11)) For environmental reasons, a base area per producer Member State should be established. In addition, the eligible areas should be restricted to those authorised by the Member States.\n\n((12)) A fixed yield per hectare should be established per producer Member State. It will determine, together with the base area requirement, the overall capping of the funds and the mainly decoupled nature of the scheme, the programme production limiting character while at the same time fulfilling the objectives of Protocol 4.\n\n((13)) In order to meet the needs of the ginning industry eligibility for the aid should be related to a minimum quality of cotton actually harvested.\n\n((14)) Furthermore, the establishment of inter-branch organisations, to be approved by the Member States, should be encouraged to allow producers and ginners to enhance the quality of the cotton. The Community should contribute indirectly to the activities of those organisations by increasing the aid to those farmers who are members of the organisations.\n\n((15)) Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((16)) Besides the new regime on the specific payment for cotton, it would seem appropriate to adopt another set of rules with the purpose of helping the cotton sector to stabilise in the new legal and market context.\n\n((17)) To the extent that the presence of the ginning industry appears necessary in the producer regions, the needs of that industry would be sufficiently satisfied,inter alia, by means of setting a minimum quality of cotton actually harvested and by allowing inter-branch organisations to enhance the quality of cotton. Moreover, considering the significant over-capacity of the ginning industry, it is appropriate to provide for additional measures to support their restructuring process with a view to improved market orientation.\n\n((18)) Furthermore, it seems appropriate that market orientation measures supporting specific quality schemes and related promotion activities be introduced. Therefore, national programmes for restructuring in the cotton sector should be established. While the relevant measures should be financed by the Community, it should be left to Member States to select the right mix for the needs of their respective constituencies, taking regional particularities into account, where necessary.\n\n((19)) The restructuring programmes should be submitted to the Commission for verification of the compliance of the measures with the conditions laid down in this Regulation and its implementing rules. Member States should be responsible for the implementation of such restructuring programmes.\n\n((20)) The measures should be complementary to already existing measures in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD)(7).\n\n((21)) The measures in such programmes may include the full and permanent dismantling of part of the ginning processing facilities to ensure a more viable ginning industry. Support may also be provided for investments in the ginning industry, geared towards improving the economic performance of the enterprises as such. Furthermore, aid may be made available to machinery contractors affected as a consequence of the restructuring of the cotton sector.\n\n((22)) To enhance the quality of European cotton, farmers who participate in specific quality schemes should receive, in the framework of such programmes, specific support to cover some of the related costs. Equally, information and promotion actions for cotton covered by these quality schemes should be supported.\n\n((23)) The allocation of the funds for the national restructuring programmes among Member States should be based on the specific needs for restructuring and adaptation in the main cotton production regions. In view of the temporary aim to restructure and adapt the cotton sector, the programmes may be terminated on request of the Member States, after which the annual budget for restructuring programmes may be added to the national ceiling of the Member State concerned for decoupled payments as established in Annex VIII to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003.\n\n((24)) In view of the absence of ginning industry in Portugal and the application of the Single Area Payment Scheme in Bulgaria, there is no need to allocate budget to national programmes for restructuring in these two Member States.\n\n((25)) In order to apply the new cotton aid scheme and the scheme restructuring the cotton sector from the start of the production season, this Regulation should apply as from calendar year 2009,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003', 'text': 'Article 1\nAmendment to Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003\nRegulation (EC) No 1782/2003 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nIn Title IV, Chapter 10a shall be replaced by the following\n‘CHAPTER 10a\nCROP SPECIFIC PAYMENT FOR COTTON\nArticle 110a\nScope\nAid shall be granted to farmers producing cotton falling within CN code 5201\xa000 under the conditions laid down in this Chapter.\nArticle 110b\nEligibility\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The aid shall be granted per hectare of eligible area of cotton.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,",{'header': '26.10.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 282/35'}

Whereas Article 75 of the Act of Accession introduces a compensatory mechanism on import into 'the Community of Nine' for fruit and vegetables coming from Greece for which an institutional price is fixed;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 75 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually, on the one hand, on the basis of the arithmetical average of producer prices of each Member State of 'the Community of Nine', increased by the transport and packaging costs borne by the products from the areas of production up to the representative centres of Community consumption and, on the other hand, taking into account the trend of production costs in the fruit and vegetables sector; whereas the said producer prices are to correspond to an average of the price quotations recorded over three years prior to fixing the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price may not exceed the level of the reference price applied vis-Ă -vis third countries, this Community offer price being reduced by 21 % at the time of the seventh move towards price alignment referred to in Article 59 of the Act;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal price variations, the marketing year should be split into several periods and a Community offer price fixed for each such period;
Whereas, by virtue of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 10/81, the rates used to calculate production prices are those recorded for an indigenous product whose trade characteristics are defined, on the representative market or markets within the production zones where the rates are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a substantial proportion of marketable production throughout the year or during a part of the year and which correspond to quality category I and to set conditions in respect of packaging; whereas the average rate for each representative market is to be drawn up disregarding rates which may be considered excessively high or low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the said market;

concerning the authorisation of inositol as a feed additive for fish and crustaceans

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) Inositol was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a nutritional additive for use in all animal species as part of the group ‘Vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect’. That substance was subsequently entered in the Community Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of Inositol as feed additive for fish, crustaceans, cats and dogs. The applicant requested that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 9 April 2014 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, Inositol does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The Authority also concluded that Inositol is regarded as an effective source of essential micronutrient for fish and crustaceans. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of Inositol shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the additives, pre-mixtures and compound feed containing them, as authorised by Directive 70/524/EEC.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '22.11.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 335/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1249/2014\nof 21 November 2014\nconcerning the authorisation of inositol as a feed additive for fish and crustaceans\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

Whereas:
(1) A surge of imports into the Community in cotton yarn (category 1) originating in Syrian Arab Republic at very low prices has taken place during the last three years. Such imports have risen from almost nil in 1996 to 10 % of Community imports in 2000.
(2) Although Community consumption has remained the same during the last three years, the surge in Syrian imports at prices lower than the general market price causes or threatens to cause serious injury to the Community producers of cotton yarn by depressing normal market prices.
(3) In order to monitor imports into the Community of cotton yarn (category 1) originating in the Syrian Arab Republic while an examination according to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 takes place, it is therefore appropriate to introduce for a period of 18 months a surveillance mechanism. Accordingly, the importation of products shipped from the Syrian Arab Republic and put into free circulation in the Community should enter the Community under the surveillance mechanism and the requirements regarding production of an import document, as set out in Article 14(1)(a), (2), (3) and (4) of Regulation (EC) No 517/94 should apply.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 2 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, those Member States have applied the Common Customs Tariff as of 1 January 1995;
Whereas the Community has opened negotiations under Article XXIV, paragraph 6 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994), in order to resolve instances where the application of the Common Customs Tariff by the new Member States leads to modification or withdrawal of tariff concessions previously bound by them;
Whereas the application of the Common Customs Tariff by the new Member States has led in some cases to the increase and in other cases to the reduction of the tariffs previously applied by each of them;
Whereas, in the context of negotiations held with a number of third countries, it is appropriate, in respect of most non-agricultural products, to apply already as from 1 January 1996 the conventional duty rates corresponding to the third stage of tariff reductions provided for in the GATT 1994 schedule of the Community of 12 which, in accordance with that schedule, is due to take place on 1 January 1997;
Whereas for the same reasons it is also appropriate, in respect of certain chemical products which are currently the subject of autonomous duty suspensions, to reduce as from 1 January 1996 the conventional rates of duty,
Whereas, in respect of certain electronic components falling within CN headings 8541 and 8542, it is appropriate to reduce as from 1 January 1996 both the conventional and the autonomous rates of duty to the level of the final rates provided for in the GATT 1994 schedule of the Community of 12 and, in some cases, below that level;
Whereas it is appropriate, in respect of certain other products, to advance the implementation of the successive reduction stages of the conventional rates of duty provided for in the GATT 1994 schedule of the Community of 12 and in some cases to reduce the conventional rates of duty (in certain instances in the form of tariff quotas) below the level of the final rate provided for in that schedule,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 3093/95 of 22 December 1995 laying down the rates of duty to be applied by the Community resulting from negotiations under GATT Article XXIV.6 consequent upon the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the European Union', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Protocol 3 to the Europe Agreement between the European Communities and the Slovak Republic, approved by Decision 94/909/EC, ECSC, Euratom of the Council and the Commission of 19 December 1994 concerning the conclusion of a Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Slovak Republic, of the other part(1), provides for tariff concessions for processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic. Protocol 3 was amended by the Protocol for the adaptation of trade aspects of the Europe Agreement with the Slovak Republic(2), hereinafter referred to as the ""Adaptation Protocol"", which was approved by Council Decision 98/638/EC(3).
(2) A trade agreement has been concluded, which amends Protocol 3. The agreement aims to improve economic convergence in preparation for the accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union and is scheduled to enter into force no later than 1 June 2003. On the Community side that agreement lays down concessions in the form of complete liberalisation of trade for certain processed agricultural products and duty-free quotas for others. For imports outside of those quotas the provisions laid down in Protocol 3 continue to apply.
(3) The procedure for adopting a decision to amend the Adaptation Protocol will not be completed in time for its entry into force on 1 July 2003. It is therefore necessary to provide for the application of the tariff concessions made to the Slovak Republic on an autonomous basis as from 1 July 2003.
(4) For the importation of certain agricultural products no customs duties should be applied and for others duty-free quotas should be opened.
(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2359/2002 of 27 December 2002 on the opening of tariff quotas for the year 2003 for imports into the European Community of certain products originating in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia(4) should continue to apply for certain goods covered by Protocol 3 but not listed in this Regulation.
(6) On processed agricultural products covered by Protocol 3 but not listed in this Regulation or for which the quotas opened by this Regulation are exhausted, the trade provision laid down in Protocol 3 should continue to apply.
(7) Processed agricultural products not covered by Annex I to the Treaty should not be eligible for export refunds under Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5).
(8) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(6) provides for a system for managing tariff quotas. The tariff quotas opened by this Regulation should be managed by the Community authorities and the Member States in accordance with that system.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down the national and regional quotas for the production of sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup. For the 2006/2007 marketing year those quotas must be adjusted by 30 September 2006.
(2) The adjustments result in particular from the application of Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006, which provide for the allocation of additional sugar quotas and additional and supplementary isoglucose quotas. The adjustments must take account of the communications from the Member States provided for in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (2) relating in particular to the additional and supplementary quotas already allocated on the date on which the communication is drawn up.
(3) The adjustments to the quotas in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 also result from the application of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 of 20 February 2006 establishing a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry in the Community and amending Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (3), which provides for restructuring aid for undertakings which renounce their quotas. It is therefore necessary to take account of the renounced quotas in accordance with the Communication from the Commission (2006/C 234/04) of 29 September 2006 on the estimated availability of financial resources for granting of restructuring aid for the 2006/2007 marketing year (4).
(4) The adjustment of the quotas laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is without prejudice to the conditions governing the grant of the aid provided for in Chapter 10f of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and modifying Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) 1452/2001, (EC) 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (5) and in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006.

It is therefore necessary to take account of the renounced quotas in accordance with the Communication from the Commission (2006/C 234/04) of 29 September 2006 on the estimated availability of financial resources for granting of restructuring aid for the 2006/2007 marketing year(4).\n\n((4)) The adjustment of the quotas laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is without prejudice to the conditions governing the grant of the aid provided for in Chapter 10f of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and modifying Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) 1452/2001, (EC) 1454/2001, (EC) 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001(5)and in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 320/2006.\n\n((5)) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 is hereby replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\n‘ANNEX III\nNATIONAL AND REGIONAL QUOTAS\nMember States or regions\n(1)\nSugar\n(2)\nIsoglucose\n(3)\nInulin syrup\n(4)\nBelgium\n819\xa0812\n85\xa0694\n0\nCzech Republic\n454\xa0862\n—\n—\nDenmark\n420\xa0746\n—\n—\nGermany\n3\xa0655\xa0456\n42\xa0360\n—\nGreece\n317\xa0502\n15\xa0433\n—\nSpain\n903\xa0843\n98\xa0845\n—\nFrance (metropolitan)\n3\xa0552\xa0221\n23\xa0755\n0\nFrench overseas departments\n480\xa0245\n—\n—\nIreland\n0\n—\n—\nItaly\n778\xa0706\n24\xa0301\n—\nLatvia\n66\xa0505\n—\n—\nLithuania\n103\xa0010\n—\nHungary\n401\xa0684\n164\xa0736\n—\nNetherlands\n864\xa0560\n10\xa0891\n0\nAustria\n387\xa0326\n—\n—\nPoland\n1\xa0671\xa0926\n32\xa0056\n—\nPortugal (mainland)\n34\xa0500\n11\xa0870\n—\nThe autonomous region of the Azores\n9\xa0953\n—\n—\nSlovakia\n207\xa0432\n50\xa0928\n—\nSlovenia\n52\xa0973\n—\n—\nFinland\n146\xa0087\n14\xa0210\n—\nSweden\n325\xa0700\n—\n—\nUnited Kingdom\n1\xa0138\xa0627\n32\xa0602\n—\nTotal\n16\xa0793\xa0675\n607\xa0681\n0 ’'}]}"

(2) The detailed rules on financial planning and participation in financing the restructuring and conversion scheme laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 stipulate that the references to a given financial year refer to the payments actually made by the Member States between 16 October and the following 15 October.
(3) In accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Commission makes initial allocations to Member States each year on the basis of objective criteria, taking into account particular situations and needs and the efforts to be undertaken in the light of the objective of the scheme.
(4) The Commission fixed the financial allocations for the 2007/08 marketing year in Decision 2007/719/EC (3).
(5) Under Article 17(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000, a penalty is applied where the actual per hectare expenditure of a Member State exceeds the initial allocation. For the 2008 financial year, this penalty is to be applied to Slovakia for an amount of EUR 6 169.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No 1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006 (1), and in particular Article 17(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, masters of Union fishing vessels of 12 metres’ length overall or more engaged in fisheries on stocks subject to a multiannual plan, which are under the obligation to record fishing logbook data electronically, are under the obligation to notify the competent authorities of their flag Member State of their intention to land at least four hours before the estimated time of arrival at port.
(2) Pursuant to Article 17(2), when Union fishing vessels intend to enter a port in a Member State other than their flag Member State, the competent authorities of their flag Member State are under the obligation to forward, immediately upon receipt, the electronic prior notification to the competent authorities of the coastal Member State.
(3) Pursuant to Article 17(6), the Commission may make provision for another notification period, taking into account, inter alia, the type of fisheries products, the distance between the fishing grounds, landing places and ports where the vessels are registered.
(4) On 28 September 2012, Spain requested that the notification period provided for in Article 17(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 be reduced to at least two hours and a half for vessels flying the flag of Spain engaged in fisheries on Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula. Of the various fleets operating under the plan, the request concerns bottom trawlers, netters, bottom long liners for fishing carried out in Cantabrian Sea and North Western Iberian peninsula and bottom trawlers in Portuguese waters.
(5) Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula are subject to the multiannual plan set out by Council Regulation (EC) No 2166/2005 of 20 December 2005 establishing measures for the recovery of the Southern hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and Western Iberian peninsula and amending Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms (2).
(6) Spatial data provided by Spain shows that the specific fleets flying the flag of Spain mentioned in recital (4) operate, as a general rule, in fishing grounds which are less than four hours distance from their landing ports. On the other hand, those landing ports are always at a distance less than two hours and a half from the Spanish control authorities’ offices. Therefore, should the vessels in question be selected for inspection, a prior notification period of at least two hours and a half would allow the concerned control authorities to carry out the corresponding inspection. Accordingly, it is appropriate to reduce the prior notification period to at least two hours and a half.
(7) For reasons of equal treatment, the same reduced prior notification period should apply to vessels of other Member States intending to land in Spanish ports.
(8) Spain should assess the impact of the reduced notification period on the control of landings of the vessels concerned one year after the entry into force of this Regulation and submit a report to the Commission. The Commission will monitor the application of the reduced prior notification period with regard to the effective inspection of the concerned vessels by the national control authorities. If, on the basis of the findings of the report submitted by Spain or on the basis of the verifications, inspections and audits carried out by the Commission within the framework of Title X of Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, it appears the reduced notification period is insufficient to ensure proper control of landings by Spain, the Commission will revise that period accordingly.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 28 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provide that the losses resulting from the obligation to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered by production levies on the production of A and B sugar and of A and B isoglucose, within certain limits;
Whereas, when the total sum of the levies provided for does not fully cover the overall loss arising from these obligations, paragraph 5 of that Article requires that an adjustment be made in the maximum amount fixed for the B levy for the marketing year immediately following the marketing year in which the balance of uncovered losses was recorded;
Whereas the sum of the levies to be raised for the 1983/84 marketing year is less than the sum resulting from the multiplication of the exportable surplus by the average loss; whereas it is therefore necessary, according to the information available, to increase, for the 1984/85 marketing year, the maximum amount of the B levy to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar and also to adjust accordingly the minimum price for B beet fixed for that marketing year by Regulation (EEC) No 1106/84 (3),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1737/84 of 18 June 1984 revising the maximum amount for the production levy on B sugar and the minimum price for B beet for the 1984/85 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran have been found to be, in many cases, contaminated with excessive levels of Aflatoxin B1;
Whereas the Scientific Committee for Food has noted that Aflatoxin B1, even at extremely low doses, causes cancer of the liver and in addition is genotoxic;
Whereas this constitutes a serious threat to public health within the Community and it is imperative to adopt protective measures at Community level;
Whereas an examination of conditions of hygiene in Iran has been undertaken and revealed that improvements in hygiene practices and the traceability of pistachios are required; whereas the mission team was unable to check all stages of the handling of pistachios prior to exportation; whereas commitments have been received from the Iranian Authorities in particular in relation to improvements in production, handling, sorting, processing, packaging and transport practices; whereas it is therefore appropriate to subject pistachios or products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran to special conditions to provide a high level of protection to public health;
Whereas pistachios and products derived from pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, may be imported, provided that these special conditions are applied;
Whereas it is necessary that pistachios and products derived from pistachios have been produced, sorted, handled, processed, packaged and transported following good hygienic practices; whereas it is necessary to establish the levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin in samples taken from the consignment immediately prior to leaving Iran;
Whereas it is necessary for documentary evidence to be provided by the Iranian Authorities to accompany each consignment of pistachios originating in, or consigned from Iran, relating to the conditions of production, sorting, handling, processing, packaging and transport and the results of laboratory analysis of the consignment for levels of Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin;
Whereas, it is necessary to submit for analyses lots of pistachios originating in, or consigned from all third countries, in order to determine the levels of contamination of pistachios from all sources with Aflatoxin B1 and total Aflatoxin, whereas co-ordinated official control programmes for foodstuffs shall be completed to this end;

introducing a common measure for the encouragement of agriculture by improving the rearing of beef cattle in certain less-favoured areas of France
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 797/85 of 12 March 1985 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures (1), and in particular Article 18 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Article 39 (2) (a) of the Treaty provides that, in working out the common agricultural policy, account is to be taken of the social structure of agriculture and of the structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions;
Whereas, in order to achieve the objectives of the common agricultural policy referred to in Article 39 (1) (a) and (b) of the Treaty, special measures appropriate to the situation in the less-favoured agricultural areas should be adopted at Community level;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 797/85, specific measures may be taken to encourage agriculture as a whole in regions suffering from structural or infrastructural handicaps;
Whereas, in certain less-favoured areas of France within the meaning of Council Directive 75/271/EEC of 28 April 1975 concerning the list of less-favoured farming areas within the meaning of Directive 75/268/EEC (France) (4) as last amended by Decision 84/266/EEC (5), agricultural incomes are particularly low because of the existence of substantial structural inadequacies;
Whereas in these less-favoured areas joint land-development measures are an essential condition for improving the profitability of the rearing of beef cattle;
Whereas, because of the fragmentation of holdings, consolidation measures are necessary for the efficient management of agricultural land;
Whereas the availability of shared equipment for fodder production and improvements in the health of the cattle herds would enable better use to be made of fodder production;
Whereas closer monitoring of the yield and the progeny of beef bulls ensures more efficient selection of breeding bulls with a high genetic value;
Whereas in the areas concerned, farmers derive additional income from the management of woodlands; whereas forestry measures should be carried out and shelter belts should be planted, mainly in connection with joint landdevelopment measures;
Whereas costs can be reduced by the joint use of equipment for the management of woodlands;
Whereas rural infrastructure in these regions is extremely inadequate, particularly as regards farm roads and local roads; whereas the provision or improvement of such facilities is essential to the improvement of agricultural structures;
Whereas additional technical assistance should be provided and information campaigns should be launched with a view to remedying the lack of structural development;
Whereas, with a view to limiting Community expenditure, it is important to prohibit the granting of aid under Regulation (EEC) No 797/85 in conjunction with aid under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2088/85 of 23 July 1985 concerning the integrated Mediterranean programmes (6);
Whereas the achievement of these should be promoted by means of a measure combining these various elements and applied in the context of the programmes;
Whereas it follows from the foregoing that the measures referred to above constitute a common measure within the meaning of Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 870/85 (2);

of 21 October 2002
concerning the implementation of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP with a view to a European Union contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons in South East Europe

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP(1) and in particular Article 6 thereof, in conjunction with the second indent of Article 23(2) of the Treaty on European Union,
Whereas:
(1) The excessive and uncontrolled accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons has fuelled crime and insecurity in South Eastern Europe, exacerbating conflict in the region and undermining post-conflict peace building, and places a serious constraint on economic and social development in South Eastern Europe.
(2) In pursuing the objectives set out in Article 1 of Joint Action 2002/589/CFSP, the European Union envisages operating within the relevant international fora and in a regional context, as appropriate, to render assistance through international organisations, programmes and agencies as well as regional arrangements.
(3) The Regional Implementation Plan on Small Arms and Light Weapons established under the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe is intended to provide a framework for South East European countries to develop programmes and project proposals leading to strengthened capabilities in controlling the illicit proliferation and flow of weapons.
(4) Under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Stability Pact, a ""South East Europe Regional Clearinghouse for Small Arms Reduction"" was established, located in Belgrade, and consisting of a technical support unit, supporting a number of regional and national level operational activities.
(5) The objectives of this clearing house include strengthening capabilities of governments and non-governmental organisations to stem the illicit flow of small arms and light weapons throughout South East Europe. The clearing house should place particular emphasis on the development of regional projects to address the reality of cross-border flows of weapons.
(6) The European Union considers that the Regional Implementation Plan, as well as the objectives of the clearing house, cover matters relating to the supply of, and demand for, small arms and light weapons and are part of the follow-up to the Programme of Action to prevent, combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its aspects (New York, 9 to 20 July 2001).
(7) The European Union considers that financial assistance to the clearing house would pursue the objective of close cooperation among States to reach the goals stated in the United Nations Programme of Action, including information-sharing, assistance and standard-setting, and highlights the role of regional organisations in fostering this cooperation.
(8) The Commission has agreed to be entrusted with the implementation of this Decision.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market, for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (1) within which those products can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates. For the same reasons it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 July 2012, for two products a new tariff quota at a zero duty rate for an appropriate volume.
(2) The quota volumes, previously established, for autonomous tariff quotas of the Union with order numbers 09.2638, 09.2814 and 09.2889 are insufficient to meet the needs of the Union industry. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased with effect from 1 January 2012.
(3) Moreover, for the autonomous tariff quota of the Union with the order number 09.2633 the product description should be adapted.
(4) In addition, for the quota with order number 09.2767, it is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant a tariff quota for the second semester 2012. That tariff quota should therefore be closed with effect from 1 July 2012 and the corresponding row should be deleted from the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.
(5) Since some of the measures provided for in this Regulation should take effect from 1 January 2012 and others from 1 July 2012, this Regulation should apply from those same dates and should enter into force immediately upon publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 2001/822/EC of 27 November 2001 on the association of the overseas countries and territories with the European Community(1), and in particular Article 37 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) On 19 June 2003, Saint Pierre and Miquelon requested a derogation for five years from the rules of origin set out in Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC in respect of an annual quantity of 105 tonnes of cooked and frozen lobster tails, legs and claws, exported from Saint Pierre and Miquelon.
(2) Saint Pierre and Miquelon based its request on the disappearance of its raw material, the originating snow crab, whose population has moved out of its territorial waters. The processing of non-originating live lobsters into cooked and frozen tails, legs and claws will replace the production chain of the snow crab, which the company concerned cannot procure.
(3) The requested derogation is justified under Annex III to Decision 2001/822/EC and, specifically, under Article 37(1) thereof, in particular as regards the development of an existing industry in Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The derogation is essential for the preservation of the activity of the plant in question, which employs a significant number of people. Subject to compliance with certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration, the derogation would not cause serious injury to an established industry of the Community or one or more of the Member States.
(4) Accordingly, a derogation should be granted in respect of certain quantities of cooked and frozen lobster tails, legs and claws processed in Saint Pierre and Miquelon and imported into the Community.
(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down the provisions for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1335/2003(3), lays down rules for the management of tariff quotas. Those rules should be applied mutatis mutandis to the management of the quantities in respect of which the derogation in question is granted.
(6) Saint Pierre and Miquelon requested that the derogation apply from 1 September 2003. However, given the date on which Saint Pierre and Miquelon submitted its request and the length of the decision process, the derogation cannot be adopted before 1 September. As a result, it will apply from 1 October 2003.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6) has laid down the active substances of plant protection products, designated by the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 and identified the notifiers for each active substance.
(2) Chlozolinate is one of the 90 active substances covered by the first stage of the work programme provided for in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, Greece, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted to the Commission, on 3 November 1997 the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the sole notifier in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(1) of this Regulation.
(4) The submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health. This review was finalised on 30 November 1999 in the format of the Commission review report for chlozolinate, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7(6) of Regulation (EC) No 3600/92.
(5) It has appeared from the assessments made that the submitted information is not sufficient to demonstrate that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned satisfy the requirements laid down in Articles 5(1)(a) and (b) and 5(2)(b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The sole notifier informed the Commission and the rapporteur Member State that it no longer wished to participate in the programme of work for this active substance. Therefore, further information required to fully comply with the requirements of Directive 91/414/EEC will not be submitted.
(7) Therefore, it is not possible to include this active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) A period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks in accordance with the provisions of Article 4(6) of Directive 91/414/EEC has to be provided.
(9) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC(7).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 60 and 301 thereof,
Having regard to Council Common Position 1999/727/CFSP of 15 November 1999 concerning restrictive measures against the Taliban(1),
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 15 October 1999, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1267 (1999); in paragraph 2 of that resolution the Security Council demanded that the Taliban without delay hand over Usama bin Laden to the authorities mentioned in that paragraph.
(2) In paragraph 3 of Resolution 1267 (1999) the Security Council decided that a flight ban and a freeze of funds and other financial resources as set out in paragraph 4 of that resolution should be imposed on 14 November 1999 unless the Security Council decided that the Taliban had fully complied with the obligation set out in the aforementioned paragraph 2.
(3) The measures set out in paragraph 4 of Resolution 1267 (1999) fall under the scope of the Treaty and, therefore, notably with a view to avoiding distortion of competition, Community legislation is necessary to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council as far as the territory of the Community is concerned, such territory being deemed to encompass, for the purposes of this Regulation, the territories of the Member States to which the Treaty is applicable, under the conditions laid down in that Treaty.
(4) In order to create maximum legal certainty within the Community, names and other relevant data with regard to persons and bodies and aircraft, as designated by the Committee established under the Resolution 1267 (1999), should be made publicly known; appropriate procedures should be established within the Community regarding this aspect.
(5) Resolution 1267 (1999) provides for certain exemptions to the restrictions imposed on the condition of prior approval of the said Committee.
(6) The approval of the said Committee should be obtained through the competent national authorities of the Member States, whose names and addresses should, therefore, be made available and annexed to this Regulation.
(7) For reasons of expediency, the Commission should be empowered to supplement and/or amend the Annexes to this Regulation on the basis of pertinent notifications from the said Committee.
(8) The competent authorities of the Member States should, where necessary, be empowered to ensure compliance with this Regulation.
(9) Violations of the provisions of this Regulation should be penalised and Member States should impose appropriate penalties to that effect.
(10) The Security Council calls for the measures to be applied notwithstanding any rights conferred or obligations imposed by any international agreement signed or any contract entered into or any licence or permit granted before the entry into force of the relevant paragraphs of Resolution 1267 (1999) enter into force.
(11) The Commission and Member States should inform each other of the measures taken under this Regulation and of other relevant information at their disposal in connection with this Regulation, and cooperate with the said Committee, including by supplying information to it,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 337/2000 of 14 February 2000 concerning a flight ban and a freeze of funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:\n\n1.

of 17 July 2000
on the European Year of Languages 2001
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular to Articles 149 and 150 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) In the preamble to the Treaty, it is stated that the Member States are: ""Determined to promote the development of the highest possible level of knowledge for their peoples through a wide access to education and through its continuous updating"".
(2) Article 18 of the Treaty establishes the right of every citizen of the European Union ""to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States"". The ability to use foreign languages is essential in order in practice fully to exercise that right.
(3) Article 151 of the Treaty states that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States while respecting their national and regional diversity, and shall take cultural aspects into account in its action under other provisions of the Treaty. Among the cultural aspects, matters pertaining to languages are of great importance.
(4) All the European languages, in their spoken and written forms, are equal in value and dignity from the cultural point of view and form an integral part of European cultures and civilisation.
(5) The languages question is a challenge that must be tackled as part of the European integration process and the European Year of Languages may therefore prove to be highly instructive as far as the formulation of measures to encourage cultural and linguistic diversity is concerned.
(6) Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union shall respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
(7) Access to the vast literary heritage in the languages in which it was originally produced would contribute to developing mutual understanding and giving a tangible content to the concept of European citizenship.
(8) It is important to learn languages as it enhances awareness of cultural diversity and helps eradicate xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance.
(9) In addition to the human, cultural and political advantages, learning languages is also of considerable potential economic benefit.
(10) A command of the respective mother tongue and knowledge of the classical languages, in particular Latin and Greek, can make it easier to learn other languages.
(11) It is important to raise awareness among public and private decision-makers of the importance of easy access to language learning facilities.
(12) The Council Conclusions of 12 June 1995 on linguistic diversity and multilingualism in the European Union emphasised that linguistic diversity must be preserved and multilingualism promoted in the Union, with equal respect for the languages of the Union and with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity. Decision No 2493/95/EC of the European Parliament and Council(5) of 23 October 1995 establishing 1996 as the ""European Year of Lifelong Learning"" highlighted the importance of the role of lifelong learning in developing competencies, including linguistic, throughout an individual's lifetime.
(13) The Commission's 1995 White Paper ""Education, training, research: Teaching and learning: towards a learning society"" established as its Objective Four proficiency for all in three Community languages. The Commission's 1996 Green Paper ""Education, Training, Research: The obstacles to transnational mobility"" concluded that ""learning at least two Community languages has become a precondition if citizens of the European Union are to benefit from occupational and personal opportunities open to them in the single market"".
(14) Council Resolution of 31 March 1995 on improving and diversifying language learning and teaching within the education systems of the European Union(6) states that pupils should as a general rule have the opportunity of learning two languages of the European Union other than their mother tongue(s) for a minimum of two consecutive years during compulsory schooling and if possible for a longer period.
(15) The measures in the Lingua programme, adopted by Council Decision 89/489/EEC(7), were reinforced and partially integrated as horizontal measures into the Socrates programme adopted by Decision 819/95/EC of the European Parliament and the Council(8). Those measures have promoted the improvement of knowledge of the languages of the Union and have thus contributed to greater understanding and solidarity between the peoples of the Union. The European Parliament and Council in their Decision No 253/2000/EC(9) propose that those measures be further developed and reinforced in the second phase of the Socrates programme.
(16) The Leonardo da Vinci programme, adopted by Decision 94/819/EC(10) of the European Parliament and the Council, has, building on the results achieved under the Lingua programme, supported activities aimed at developing linguistic skills as part of vocational training measures. That support will be further developed and reinforced in the second phase of the Leonardo da Vinci programme, adopted by Council Decision 1999/382/EC(11).
(17) The Culture 2000 programme adopted by Decision No 508/2000/EC(12) also contributes to improving mutual understanding of the cultural achievements of the European peoples, especially by highlighting cultural diversity and multilingualism.
(18) A multiannual programme to promote the linguistic diversity of the Community in the information society was established by Council Decision 96/664/EC(13).
(19) The Report of the High Level Panel on the Free Movement of Persons presented to the Commission on 18 March 1997, considered ""the multiplicity of European languages [to be] ... a treasure to be safeguarded"" and suggested measures to foster language training and the use of languages in the Community.
(20) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as defined in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, inter alia because of the need for a coherent Community-wide information campaign avoiding duplication and achieving economies of scale. Those objectives can be better achieved by the Community, owing to the transnational dimension of Community actions and measures. This Decision does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(21) However, it is also important that there should be close cooperation and coordination between the Commission and the Member States, so as to ensure that measures undertaken at European level are underpinned by small-scale measures undertaken at local, regional and national level which are likely to be more suited to the needs of target groups and specific situations, and that cultural diversity is strengthened as a result.
(22) It is important to develop appropriate cooperation between the European Community and the Council of Europe so as to ensure consistency between measures undertaken at Community level and those undertaken by the Council of Europe, and such cooperation is expressly mentioned in Article 149 of the Treaty.
(23) It is important to take into account the fact that the European Year of Languages will take place against the background of preparations for the enlargement of the Union.
(24) This Decision lays down for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission(14), for the budgetary authority, during the annual budgetary procedure.
(25) The Joint Declaration of 4 May 1999 by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission(15) sets out the arrangements for the implementation of the co-decision procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty.
(26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this decision should be adopted in accordance with the Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(16),","{'title': 'Decision No 1934/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on the European Year of Languages 2001', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nEstablishment of the European Year of Languages\n\n1.

Other measures:\n\nSurveys and studies on a Community-wide scale, having, inter alia, the aim of:\n\n- better defining the situation in Europe with regard to languages (including sign languages and the classical languages), their use (including in scientific and university research) and language teaching and learning and the acquisition of related skills; as far as possible, all the languages referred to in Article 1 are concerned,\n\n- better defining the expectations of different target groups (including those in bilingual areas) with regard to language learning and the way in which the Community could fulfil those expectations,\n\n- carrying out evaluation studies concerning the effectiveness and impact of the European Year of Languages, examining best practice in the field of language teaching and training and disseminating the results throughout the Member States.\n\nB.

Technical assistance\n\nIn carrying out these measures, the Commission may have recourse to technical assistance organisations, funding for which may be provided for within the overall budget for the programme. It may, under the same conditions, have recourse to experts. The Commission shall consult the committee referred to in Article 5 on the financial impact of this assistance.'}]}"

In view of the situation on the Community market in trout reared exclusively in fresh water, the Commission cannot approve that part of the programme relating to the establishment of new installations for farming such species. Furthermore, it points out that with regard to projects for modernizing existing fish farms in this field, it will give priority to investments aimed at reducing pollution, and in particular pollution generated by waste water, and investments enabling the mortality rate in ponds to be reduced.\n\n3. The Commission points out that the investment requirement contained in the programme does not imply any commitment as regards financial support from the Community.\n\n4.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(3), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 31 August 1996, by means of two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(4) and an anti-subsidy proceeding(5) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway.
(2) These proceedings resulted in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(6) and (EC) No 1891/97(7) in September 1997, in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation.
(3) In parallel to this, by Decision 97/634/EC(8), the Commission accepted undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters and imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway which were exported by these companies to the Community were exempted from the said anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
(4) The form of the duties was later reviewed and Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and (EC) No 1891/97 were replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(9).
B. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING
(5) The undertakings offered by the Norwegian companies oblige them, inter alia, to export the product concerned to the Community at or above certain minimum price levels (""MIPs"") laid down in the undertaking. These MIPs, which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping, are applicable to different ""presentations"" or categories of salmon (e.g. ""gutted fish, head off"", ""gutted fish, head on"" etc.).
(6) The companies are also obliged to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their sales to the Community in a quarterly report of all sales transactions of farmed Atlantic salmon sold by them (or any of their related importers in the Community), to unrelated customers in the Community.
(7) Without prejudice to its right to revoke the undertaking pursuant to Article 8(10) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96, the Commission performs on-the-spot verification visits at the premises of selected companies on a regular basis in order to determine the veracity and accuracy of the information provided in these quarterly reports. In this regard, visits were made in November 2000 to several exporters in Norway.
(8) At one company visited, Haafa Fish AS (UT No 1/60, TARIC additional code 8302, ""Haafa fisk AS""), it was found that for the first and third quarters of 2000 the net weighted average sales prices for ""presentation f"" (i.e. ""whole fish fillets exceeding 300 g in weight"") was significantly below the MIP fixed in clause C.3 of the undertaking. In addition the net weighted average sales price for ""presentation b"" (i.e. ""gutted fish, head on"") during the third quarter of 2000 was also well below the MIP stipulated in the undertaking.
(9) Haafa Fish AS had also reported to the Commission several consignments of salmon apparently sold to a company in Denmark, however, the visit showed that Haafa Fish AS had prepared the invoices for these consignments on behalf of another Norwegian company which did not have an undertaking accepted by the Commission.
(10) In respect of these transactions, it was found that Haafa Fish AS did not actually pay the supplier in Norway for the goods, nor did it receive payment for them from the company in the Community. It was stated that payment for these shipments was made instead by the Community importer direct to the supplier in Norway, with Haafa Fish AS receiving what was effectively a commission from the supplier.
(11) It is considered that this type of business practice is incompatible with the obligations imposed by the undertaking since the benefit of the undertaking is only intended to cover exports made by Haafa Fish AS and not third parties from whom the Commission has not accepted an undertaking. In addition, Haafa Fish AS does not know how much was actually paid by the importer to the supplier and cannot therefore even be certain that the amount paid was at or above the MIP.
(12) It follows that in submitting quarterly undertaking reports of ""sales"" to the Community which were not made by it, but by another exporter, and which did not necessarily reflect the real value of the underlying financial transactions, the company made false representations and misled the Commission with regard to its true function as the exporter capable of respecting the undertaking granted in its favour, and also as to the true nature and price level of certain sales, contrary to the requirements of the undertaking.
(13) In view of this and the price violations set out in recital, the Commission concludes that a breach of the undertaking has occurred. Accordingly, acceptance of the undertaking offered by Haafa Fish AS should be withdrawn and definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed against it.
(14) The company was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to recommend the imposition of definitive antidumping and countervailing duties against it. It was also granted a period within which to request a hearing and to make representations, however, no comments were received within the time limit set.
C. CHANGES OF NAME AND OWNERSHIP
(15) One Norwegian exporter with an undertaking, Polar Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/140, TARIC additional code 8247 ), advised the Commission that the group of companies to which it belonged had been reorganised that another company within the group, Polar Salmon AS, was now responsible for exports to the Community. The company therefore requested that its name be replaced by that of Polar Salmon AS on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
(16) Two other exporters, Hydro Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/66, TARIC additional code 8159 ) and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS (UT No 1/145, TARIC additional code 8256 ) advised the Commission that their ownership and names had changed, and requested that the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted be amended accordingly.
(17) Having verified the nature of the requests, the Commission considers that they are all acceptable since the modifications do not entail any substantive changes which would affect the reassessment of dumping or subsidisation. Nor do these changes affect any of the considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking was based.
(18) Consequently, the names of Polar Seafood Norway, Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS should be changed to Polar Salmon AS, Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
D. CESSATION OF TRADING BY TWO NORWEGIAN COMPANIES
(19) The Commission has also been advised that two Norwegian companies from which undertakings were accepted, Delfa Norge A/S (UT No 1/36, TARIC additional code 8134 ) and OK-Fish Kvalheim AS (UT No 1/134, TARIC additional code 8239 ) recently ceased trading and have either been wound up, or are in the process of being wound up. This information was received in the case of Delfa Norge A/S from the majority shareholder in the company and, in the case of OK-Fish Kvalheim AS, from the official liquidator. Accordingly, the names of these two companies should be deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
E. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING
(20) Following changes in its trading patterns, Nova Sea AS (UT No 1/130, TARIC additional code 8235 ), advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking. Accordingly, the name of this company should be deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
(21) In view, however, of the voluntary nature of the withdrawal, the company was advised that it could, if it so wished (and subject to certain conditions), offer an undertaking again in the future as a new exporter in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999.
F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC
(22) In view of the above changes, the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC should be amended accordingly.
(23) The Advisory Committee has been consulted on all of the above changes and has raised no objections.
(24) For the sake of clarity, an updated version of the Annex to that Decision is published herewith, showing all the exporters whose undertakings are currently in force. In parallel to this Decision, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1469/2001(10) has also withdrawn the exemption from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties granted to Haafa Fish SA, Delfa Norge A/S, OK-Fish Kvalheim AS and Nova Sea AS and transferred the exemptions granted to Polar Seafood Norway AS, Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS to Polar Salmon AS, Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively by amending the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999,","{'title': '2001/544/EC: Commission Decision of 26 June 2001 amending Decision 97/634/EC accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings concerning imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway (notified under document number C(2001) 1662)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Decision 97/634/EC is replaced by the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nDone at Brussels, 26 June 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 257, 11.10.2000, p. 2.\n\n(3) OJ L 288, 21.10.1997, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ C 253, 31.8.1996, p. 18.\n\n(5) OJ C 253, 31.8.1996, p. 20.\n\n(6) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 1.\n\n(7) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 19.\n\n(8) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 81.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions, the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty and the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The French Government submitted to the Commission on 28 April 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the region of Languedoc-Roussillon fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. As permitted by Article 40(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(2), the draft includes rural development measures other than those referred to in Article 35(1) of the Regulation. It also includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000 the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible is 1 January 2000 in the case of the Structural Funds. In the case of the EAGGF Guarantee Section, Article 6 of Comission Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999(3) provides that the expenditure is eligible only if it has actually been paid to the beneficiary after the date of submission of the programme. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The rural development measures to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section are governed, in particular as regards their compatibility and consistency with common agricultural policy measures, by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(7) The Single Programming Document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(8) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(9) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(10) The EIB has been involved in drawing up the Single Programming Document in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and has declared itself prepared to contribute to its implementation in conformity with its statutory provisions.
(11) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(12) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this Single Programming Document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/511/EC: Commission Decision of 22 March 2001 approving the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon in France (notified under document number C(2001) 633)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon in France eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) In accordance with the AoA the Philippines was subsequently granted an extension of the special treatment for rice from 1 July 2005 to 30 June 2012 by modifying its Schedule LXXV.
(3) Continuation of special treatment for rice after 30 June 2012 was contingent on the outcome of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, providing an alternative special mechanism. However, the DDA negotiations have not yet been concluded.
(4) The Philippines notified the Committee on Agriculture of the WTO on 22 November 2011 of its intention to enter into negotiations with WTO Members that have substantial interest in the products concerned for the continuation of its special treatment for rice.
(5) Article IX paragraphs 3 and 4 of the WTO Agreement sets out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning Multilateral Trade Agreements.
(6) On that basis on 20 March 2012, the Philippines requested a WTO waiver from its obligations under Article 4.2 and Section B of Annex 5 of the AoA in order to receive special treatment for rice from 1 July 2012 until 30 June 2017.
(7) The Union is a net importer of rice. The granting of this waiver would thus be of minimal economic and trade importance to the Union.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 46(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2011/30/EU (2) allowed the auditors and audit entities from the third countries and territories listed in the Annex to that Decision to continue their activities in the Union in relation to audit reports concerning the annual or consolidated accounts for financial years starting during the period from 2 July 2010 to 31 July 2012.
(2) The Commission has carried out assessments of the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities of the third countries and territories listed in the Annex to Decision 2011/30/EU. The assessments were carried out with the assistance of the European Group of Auditors’ Oversight Bodies. The public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities of those third countries and territories were assessed in the light of the criteria set out in Articles 29, 30 and 32 of Directive 2006/43/EC which govern the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit firms of the Member States. The ultimate objective of cooperation between Member States and third country systems of public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty for auditors and audit entities should be to reach mutual reliance on each other’s oversight systems based on their equivalence.
(3) Following such assessments, it appears that Abu Dhabi, Brazil, Dubai International Financial Centre, Guernsey, Indonesia, Isle of Man, Jersey, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand have public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities that operate under similar rules to those set out in Articles 29, 30 and 32 of Directive 2006/43/EC. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities of those third countries as equivalent to the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit firms of the Member States.
(4) Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Egypt, Mauritius, New Zealand, Russia and Turkey have established or are in the process of establishing public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities. However, information about the functioning and the rules governing such systems is not sufficient to carry out an equivalence assessment. In order to carry out a further assessment for the purpose of taking a final equivalence decision in respect of such systems, there is a need to obtain additional information from those third countries and territories in order to better understand their system. Therefore, it is appropriate to extend the transitional period granted by Decision 2011/30/EU in respect of the auditors and audit entities that provide audit reports concerning the annual or consolidated accounts of companies incorporated in those third countries and territories.
(5) The auditors and audit entities that provide audit reports concerning the annual or consolidated accounts of companies incorporated in Hong Kong, India and Israel benefited from the transitional period granted by Decision 2011/30/EU. Since then, those third countries or territories have not established an independent system of public oversight, quality assurance, investigations and penalties. They have not provided information regarding their audit regulatory and oversight systems. Under these circumstances, it appears that those third countries or territories have not taken the necessary measures to have their audit regulation recognised by the Commission as equivalent to the public oversight, quality assurance, investigation and penalty systems for auditors and audit entities of the Member States. Therefore, the transitional period granted to them by Decision 2011/30/EU should not be extended in respect of the auditors and audit entities that provide audit reports concerning the annual or consolidated accounts of companies incorporated in those third countries.
(6) In order to protect investors, auditors and audit entities that provide audit reports concerning the annual or consolidated accounts of companies incorporated in the third countries listed in Annex II to this Decision should be able to continue their audit activities during the transitional period in the Union without being registered under Article 45 of Directive 2006/43/EC only if they provide the required information. Provided they give the information, those auditors and audit entities should be able to continue their activities in relation to audit reports concerning annual or consolidated accounts for financial years starting during the period from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2015. This Decision should not affect the right of the Member States to apply their investigation and penalty systems in respect of such auditors and audit entities.
(7) Decision 2011/30/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas establishments in non-member countries cannot be authorized to export fresh meat to the Community unless they satisfy the general and special conditions laid down in Directive 72/462/EEC;
Whereas Argentina has forwarded, in accordance with Article 4 (3) of Directive 72/462/EEC, a list of the establishments authorized to export to the Community;

of 12 July 2011
authorising Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC
(2011/445/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter of 27 December 2010, Germany sought authorisation to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’), pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.
(2) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Germany aims at promoting a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.
(3) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities. The measure is therefore expected to contribute to the Union’s environmental and health policy objectives.
(4) Allowing Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity taxation to shore-side electricity does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the abovementioned objective, since on-board generation will remain the more competitive alternative in most cases. For the same reason, and because of the current relatively low degree of market penetration of the technology, the measure is unlikely to lead to significant distortions in competition during its lifetime and will thus not negatively affect the proper functioning of the internal market.
(5) It follows from Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC that each authorisation granted under that provision is to be strictly limited in time. Given the need for a period long enough not to discourage port operators from making the necessary investments, but also the need to review the situation in Germany in due time and the need not to undermine future developments of the existing legal framework, it is appropriate to grant the authorisation requested for a period of 3 years, subject however to the entry into application of general provisions in the matter, at a point in time earlier than the expiry thus foreseen,","{'header': '22.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 191/22', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 12 July 2011\nauthorising Germany to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’) in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\n(2011/445/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter of 27 December 2010, Germany sought authorisation to apply a reduced rate of electricity tax to electricity directly provided to vessels at berth in a port (‘shore-side electricity’), pursuant to Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC.\n\n((2)) With the tax reduction it intends to apply, Germany aims at promoting a more widespread use of shore-side electricity as an environmentally less harmful way for ships to satisfy their electricity needs while lying at berth in ports as compared to the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels.\n\n((3)) In so far as the use of shore-side electricity avoids emissions of air pollutants associated with the burning of bunker fuels on board the vessels at berth, it contributes to an improvement of local air quality in port cities.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to  improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), as last amended by  Regulation (EEC) N° 3946/92 (2),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) N° 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for  the conservation and management of fishery resources (3), and in particular Article 2 (d) thereof,  lists as one of its objectives conservation measures consisting of restricting fishing effort;
Whereas the resolution of the European Parliament on the Commission's 1991 report on the common  fisheries policy (4) refers to the structural adjustment of the fleet through the adoption of a new  generation of MGPs ensuring a reduction in fishing capacity differentiated according to region and  fishery;
Whereas at its meeting of 3 April 1992 the Council concluded that in order to ensure the continuity  of fisheries, one of the objectives of the future common fisheries policy must be to re-establish  the balance between resources and fishing effort, including capacity, and to maintain a balanced  and rational management of resources;
Whereas the Economic and Social Committee, in its opinion on the 1991 report delivered on 27 May  1992,  takes the view that the MGPs are an essential means of matching fishing capacity to  exploitable resources and that further reduction of the Community's fleet must be differentiated;
Whereas on 30 April 1991 the Danish Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance  programme for the fishing fleet for the period 1992 to 1996, herinafter called 'the programme`, in  accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86; whereas it later forwarded additional  information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether the programme fulfils the conditions laid down in  Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and  national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas the objectives for reducing fleet capacity fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programme constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the  effort still needed to ensure that the objectives are achieved;
Whereas the Commission adopted a transitional programme for 1992 (5); whereas the objectives fixed  in the Danish transitional programme should be included in the objectives of the present  programme;
Whereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in  order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in  particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is most apparent; whereas coefficients for the  reduction of fishing effort, differentiated according to fishery or group of fisheries, should  therefore be applied to the segments of the fleet thus identified;
Whereas account must be taken of an annual increase of 2 % in fishing effort linked to technical  progress;
Whereas available biological and economic analyses suggest that overall reduction in fishing  effort, differentiated for the broad groups of target species, should be of 20 % for demersal  species, 15 % for benthic species and zero growth in effort for pelagic species;
Whereas, in order to attain these objectives and improve fishing methods, reductions in effort  should primarily be focused on segments of the fleet using non-selective gear, particularly those  likely to catch large numbers of juveniles, while ensuring that there is no increase in segments  using more selective gear;.
Whereas, in order to attain the objectives of the programme, it may be necessary to take steps to  influence all the parameters connected with fishing mortality, particularly the capacity and  activity of the fleet; whereas, however, structural measures must be focused chiefly on the  elimination of excess capacity;
Whereas it is necessary to verify that the objectives fixed in the programme are progressively and  coherently met; whereas intermediate and indicative annual objectives should therefore be  determined as a basis for Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86;
Whereas in addition to the six-monthly transmission by Denmark of statements concerning development  of the fishing fleet and, where applicable, its activity, it is necessary to ensure that these data  tally with the information in the Community register of fishing vessels;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the  objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken  under this programme may not warrant Community financial assistance;
Whereas to programme a concerted and balanced reduction in the overall fishing effort of the  Community's fleets requires the Community aid scheme to be focused on measures enabling the  objectives of the programme to be attained within the deadlines laid down; whereas priority  should  also be given to investments aimed at bringing the fleet into line with Community rules on hygiene  and safety and to investments in the development of selective fisheries which cause minimum damage  to the marine environment;

Final objectives for each segment The final objectives shall be fixed in terms of capacity (tonnage in GRT and engine power in kW) on  the basis of the initial objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the transitional programme for  1992.\n\nThe following formula shall be used to determine the objective for each segment:\n\nLet (a) be a segment for which the capacity in tonnage and engine power at 1 January 1992 is known  and to which a reduction coefficient (y) is applied.\n\nSegment objective (a) = (1 y) × situation at 1. 1. 1992 × overall objective at 31. 12. 1991overall  situation at 1. 1. 1992 3. Calculation of reductions in activity By the end of the programme, for the Member States applying this provision, activity must be  reduced to a predetermined level not exceeding the authorized limits, so that the sum of the annual  intermediate reductions in activity is at least equal to that which would result from a linear  reduction in activity year by year.\n\nThe reductions in fishing effort thus achieved will be calculated at the end of the programme so  that the objectives can be readjusted by a percentage equal to that due to the effect of the  reductions in activity on overall fishing effort.\n\nNon-application of these measures may not result in an authorization to increase activity.\n\n4. Annual intermediate objectives In order to ensure proper monitoring based on the gradual achievement of the objectives fixed in  the programme, annual intermediate objectives shall be set for the programme. These objectives  shall be expressed as a percentage of the objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programmes.\n\nIn addition to the single objective of 2 % fixed in the transitional programme for 1992, a  percentage equal to 25 % of the overall objective less 2 % should be achieved in each year of the  programme, starting from 31 December 1993.\n\n5. Implementation and monitoring Implementation of the measures to reduce the activity of vessels in certain segments of the fleet  will require that the Member State provide the Commission with the assurance that it will have the  following information for each of the segments concerned:\n\n- the data on the level of activity prior to the entry into force of the measures (reference basis:  1991),\n\n- assurance that it has effective time at sea management tools and is able to manage licensing  schemes, particularly with regard to multipurpose vessels,\n\n- data for monitoring the effect of the measures implemented under this programme in accordance  with Article 2 and the rules on the Community register of fishing vessels. Such measures must  produce effects which can be checked by the Commission pursuant to the Community rules on  controls.\n\n6. Planned measures Notwithstanding Articles 6 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86, priority shall be given to:\n\n- measures to adjust fishing capacity in line with exploitable resources,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels in order to bring them into line with Community rules on  hygiene and safety,\n\n- investments to improve fishing methods and allow fishing which is more selective and/or less  damaging to the marine environment,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels to improve the control of fishing operations.\n\nThe Commission hereby reminds local, regional and national authorities that any structural aid  granted to the sector in question must be included in the present programme.\n\n7. Revision of the programme The programme may be revised, on the initiative of the Commission, in the light of the experience  gained and the national and Community rules in force, in order to take account of new factors which  might help improve the implementation of the programme and ensure that its objectives are better  met.\n\nSuch revision must take place before the end of 1994.\n\nRevision may, if necessary, include the insertion into the programme of the tools for managing  measures to reduce the activity of fishing vessels for certain segments of the fleet. To this end  the objectives of the segments concerned will be expressed in a unit of measurement of capacity  (engine power and/or tonnage) per activity (time at sea), or using any other formula approved by  the Commission.\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

amending Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 as regards catch limits for certain stocks of Norway pout, whiting and haddock
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 of 16 January 2008 fixing for 2008 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (1), and in particular Articles 5(5) and 5(7) thereof:
Whereas:
(1) Preliminary catch limits for the stock of Norway pout in ICES zone IIIa and in EC waters of ICES zones IIa and IV are laid down in Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008.
(2) Pursuant to Article 5(5) of that Regulation, the Commission may revise those catch limits in the light of scientific information collected during the first half of 2008.
(3) Taking into account information collected during the first half of 2008, the final catch limits for Norway pout in the zones concerned should be fixed.
(4) The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries advises that catches in 2008 of up to 148 000 tonnes would correspond to a fishing mortality of 0,6 and are expected to maintain the stock above precautionary limits.
(5) Norway pout is a North Sea stock which is shared with Norway but which is currently not managed jointly by the two Parties. The measures provided for in this Regulation should be in accordance with consultations held with Norway pursuant to the provisions of the Agreed Record of conclusions of fisheries consultations between the European Community and Norway of 26 November 2007.
(6) In consequence, the Community share of the total allowable catches (TAC) of Norway pout in ICES zone IIIa and in EC waters of ICES zones IIa and IV should be fixed at 75 % of 148 000 tonnes.
(7) Pursuant to Article 5(7) of Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 the catch limits for the stock of whiting in ICES zone IIIa, the stock of whiting in ICES zone IV and EC waters of ICES zone IIa, the stock of haddock in ICES zone IIIa and EC waters of ICES zones IIIb, IIIc and IIId, and the stock of haddock in ICES zone IV and EC waters of ICES zone IIa may be revised by the Commission as a consequence of a revision of the catch limits for the stock of Norway pout in accordance with Article 5(5) of that Regulation, to take into account industrial by-catches of those stocks in the Norway pout fishery.
(8) In view of the limited fisheries for Norway pout in ICES zone IIIa and EC waters of ICES zones IIIb, IIIc and IIId, and in the absence of any new forecasts of the by-catches of haddock and whiting in other industrial fisheries operating in those zones, the catch limits for the stocks of whiting and haddock in ICES zone IIIa and EC waters of ICES zones IIIb, IIIc and IIId should remain unchanged for the remainder of 2008.
(9) Taking into account the fixing of the final catch limits for Norway pout in ICES zone IIIa and in EC waters of ICES zones IIa and IV, the catch limits for whiting and haddock in ICES zone IV and in EC waters of ICES zone IIa should be revised.
(10) Norway pout is a short-lived species. Consequently the catch limitations should be implemented as soon as possible, in order to avoid delays which could lead to overfishing of the stock.
(11) Annex IA to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 128 thereof,

Whereas, at its meetings in London on 5 and 6 December 1986 and Madrid on 26 and 27 June 1989, the European Council emphasized both the importance of Community actions directed towards the improvement of training and the fundamental nature of the  upgrading of human resources through training for economic and social development;
Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 22 December 1986 on an action programme on employment growth (5), took the view that an indispensable element in employment growth was the upgrading of vocational training, an improvement in the level of  qualifications and the development of cooperation between the social partners;
Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 5 June 1989 on continuing vocational training (6), stressed the essential role of continuing vocational training in making full use of human resources with a view to completion of the internal market;
Whereas, in the context of the social dialogue, a joint opinion adopted on 6 March 1987 stressed the need for effective training for workers and managerial staff in the new technologies;
Whereas, in its Decision 87/569/EEC (7), the Council adopted an action programme for the vocational training of young people and their preparation for adult and working life, stressing the need to develop the capacity of vocational training systems to  adapt to rapid technological, economic and social change;
Whereas, in its Decision 89/27/EEC (Comett II) (8), the Council reiterated the importance it attached to cooperation between universities and industry regarding vocational training in the field of advanced technology;
Whereas technological and industrial cooperation in the field of research and development, was the subject of Decisions 88/279/EEC (Esprit) (9), 85/196/EEC (Brite/Euram) (10), 88/419/EEC (Science) (11), 88/417/EEC (Delta) (12) and 89/286/EEC (Sprint)  (13);
Whereas measures to supplement the instruments adopted by the Council should be adopted in order to promote the adaptability of vocational training systems to technological change and in order to contribute to the achievement of the principle of  economic and social cohesion;
Whereas the Commission work programme for 1985 to 1988, which was the subject of a Commission communication to the Council on 18 April 1985, made consequent to the Council resolution of 2 June 1983 concerning vocational training measures relating to new  information technologies (14) demonstrated the importance of developing cooperation between the Member States with a view to making full use of the possibilities offered by new technologies in vocational training systems;
Whereas the usefulness of technological development for industry depends on the adaptability of the qualifications and the spirit of enterprise of the workforce; whereas it is necessary to reinforce Community initiatives directed towards making optimum  use, within this programme, of
;
;
;
human resources and investment in vocational training; whereas vocational training plays an important role in the strategy of achieving the internal market;
Whereas in extending the Council resolution of 3 November 1986 concerning the action programme for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (15), provision should be made for such enterprises to participate in the implementation of this programme and  in the dissemination of the results achieved;
Whereas both sides of industry at Community level have repeatedly asked to be fully associated in the implementation of such programmes.","{'title': '89/657/EEC: Council Decision of 18 December 1989 establishing an action programme to promote innovation in the field of vocational training resulting from technological change in the European Community (Eurotecnet)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nEstablishment of the Eurotecnet programme\n\n1.

They shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such cooperation and shall consult and cooperate in international negotiations and organizations with a view to achieving common fisheries objectives.\n\n1.  (a) The Government of Canada undertakes to grant access to vessels flying the flag of Member States of the Community to fish within the area off the east coast of Canada, brought under Canadian fisheries jurisdiction after 31 December 1976, for allotments, as appropriate, of parts of total allowable catches  surplus to Canadian harvesting capacity, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n(b) The Community undertakes to grant access to Canadian vessels to fish within the fishery zone of the Community for allotments, as appropriate, of parts of total allowable catches surplus to Community harvesting capacity, in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n2. Each Party shall determine annually for the waters under its fisheries jurisdiction referred to in paragraph 1, subject to adjustment when necessary to meet unforeseen circumstances:    (a) the total allowable catch for individual stocks or complexes of stocks taking into account the scientific evidence available to it, the interdependence of stocks, the work of appropriate international organizations and other relevant factors;\n\n(b) its harvesting capacity in respect of such stocks ; and\n\n(c) after appropriate consultations, allotments, as appropriate, for fishing vessels of the other Party of parts of surpluses of stocks or complexes of stocks and the areas within which these allotments may be fished.\n\n3. In determining the allotments and areas where fishing may take place, each Party will take into account inter alia:    - its interests,\n\n- the amount of the surplus of total allowable catches of relevant stocks,\n\n- traditional fishing by vessels of the other Party,\n\n- reciprocity of access,\n\n- other benefits which may be offered pursuant to the cooperation referred to in Article VIII.\n\n1. Each Party shall take all appropriate measures to oblige its vessels to operate in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and with any measures agreed upon from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement.\n\n2. Each Party may take within its area of fisheries jurisdiction such measures, in conformity with international law, as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Agreement by vessels of the other Party.\n\n3. Each Party shall take, within its area of fisheries jurisdiction, the necessary measures to give effect to the provisions of this Agreement, which may include the issuing of licences.\n\n4. Fishing vessels of one Party shall, when fishing within the area of fisheries jurisdiction of the other Party, comply with all laws governing fishing activities in that area.\n\n5. Each Party may establish measures which it deems to be required for the conservation, rational management, and regulation of fisheries within its fishery zone, provided that such measures are not taken for the specific purpose of impeding the fishing vessels of the other Party from taking the allocations granted under this Agreement.\n\nThe two Parties shall cooperate, either bilaterally or through appropriate international organizations, to ensure the proper management and conservation of stocks occurring within the fishery zones of both Parties and stocks of associated species.\n\nIn particular, they shall endeavour to harmonize the regulatory measures applicable to these stocks, and shall consult frequently and exchange relevant fisheries statistics for this purpose.\n\nEach Party shall cooperate with the other Party, as appropriate, in light of the development of their fisheries relations pursuant to the provisions of Article II, in scientific research required for the purposes of management, conservation and utilization of the living resources in the area under the fisheries jurisdiction of that other Party. For these purposes, scientists of the two Parties shall consult regarding such research and the analysis and interpretation of the results obtained.\n\n1. Each Party shall, subject to the availability of facilities and to the needs of its own vessels, allow vessels which it has licensed pursuant to this Agreement to enter its ports in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and administrative requirements, for the purpose of purchasing bait, supplies or outfits or effecting repairs, or for such other purposes as that Party may determine.\n\n2. Such authorization shall become null and void in respect of any vessel licensed pursuant to this Agreement upon the cancellation or termination of its licence, except for the purpose of entering port to purchase supplies or effect repairs necessary for its outward voyage.\n\n3. The provisions of this Article shall not affect access to the ports of either Party in cases of distress, medical emergency or force majeure.\n\n1. The two Parties reaffirm their attachment to the cooperation provided for in the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the North-West Atlantic Fisheries, to which they are Contracting Parties and, in particular, in Article XI, paragraph 4, thereof.\n\n2. In the event that third-party fishing causes a threat to the conservation of the living resources of the waters beyond and adjacent to the areas referred to in Article II, the two Parties agree to take cooperative action to overcome that threat.\n\n1. The two Parties shall encourage economic and commercial cooperation in the field of fisheries.\n\n2. To this end, the two Parties shall, in particular, utilize the possibilities offered by the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation between Canada and the European Communities in the fisheries sector with a view to improving in a reciprocal manner the conditions and terms of their fisheries relations.\n\nThe two Parties shall carry out periodic bilateral consultations regarding the development of further cooperation in relation to fisheries, including cooperation on such matters as fisheries trade, exchanges of technical information and specialized personnel, improvement of utilization and processing of catches, and arrangements for the use of the ports of each Party by fishing vessels of the other Party to ship or discharge crew members or other persons and for such other purposes as may be agreed upon.\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Decision 90/424/EEC, the Community may undertake, or assist the Member States or international organisations in undertaking the technical and scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and for the development of veterinary education or training.
(2) The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) is the intergovernmental organisation responsible for improving animal health worldwide and for setting standards for international trade of animals and their products. The OIE is currently developing guidelines on animal identification and traceability. When adopted, these guidelines will be an international reference standard according to the WTO agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS). They will be the basis for any relevant legislation implemented by the OIE member countries including the EU Member States. Therefore, they will have a direct and considerable impact on the development of Community veterinary legislation. Considering the importance of trade in animals and animal products it is important for the EU to have the future OIE standards as close as possible to the current and future Community legislation.
(3) The Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the regions on a new Animal Health Strategy for the EU (2007 to 2013) describes traceability as one of the main tools of the new animal health strategy. In this context it is appropriate to actively promote Community standards at international level.
(4) The OIE is planning a Conference on Animal Identification and Traceability aiming at supporting the worldwide implementation of international standards for identification and traceability. This conference will have a considerable influence on the further development of international standards for animal identification and traceability. It is therefore appropriate to make a Community financial contribution to the OIE conference.
(5) The OIE has a de facto monopoly in its sector, as mentioned in Article 168(1)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 (2) laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities; hence a call for proposals is not required.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. 1-naphthylacetic acid, previously referred to as ‘naphthylacetic acid’, is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 (4) and (EC) No 2229/2004 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included 1-naphthylacetic acid.
(3) In accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report referred to in Article 24(2) of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/941/EC of 8 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (6) was adopted on the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetic acid.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I.
(5) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/941/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 12 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on 1-naphthylacetic acid to the Commission on 15 February 2011 (7). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for 1-naphthylacetic acid.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetic acid may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve 1-naphthylacetic acid in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that 1-naphthylacetic acid should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(11) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetic acid. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(12) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (8) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.

(14) Decision 2008/941/EC provides for the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetic acid and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning ‘naphthylacetic acid’ in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/941/EC accordingly.

That list included 1-naphthylacetic acid.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No\xa02229/2004 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report referred to in Article 24(2) of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/941/EC of 8 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances(6)was adopted on the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetic acid.\n\n((4)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No\xa033/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I.\n\n((5)) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No\xa02229/2004. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/941/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No\xa033/2008.\n\n((6)) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 12 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No\xa033/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on 1-naphthylacetic acid to the Commission on 15 February 2011(7). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for 1-naphthylacetic acid.\n\n((7)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetic acid may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve 1-naphthylacetic acid in accordance with Regulation (EC) No\xa01107/2009.\n\n((8)) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No\xa01107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.\n\n((9)) Without prejudice to the conclusion that 1-naphthylacetic acid should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n\n((10)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n\n((11)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No\xa01107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No\xa01107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetic acid. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((12)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No\xa03600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(8)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data.

Whereas the abovementioned Decision requires Member States to have prior authorization from the Commission before introducing intra-Community surveillance of the imports concerned;
Whereas the Portuguese Government has submitted an application to the Commission for such authorization in respect of motor-cycles originating in Japan falling under Common Customs Tariff heading No ex 87.09, NIMEXE code 87.09-10;
Whereas Portugal maintains quantitative restrictions on imports of the products in question because of the economic difficulties facing the sector concerned in Portugal;
Whereas, as a result, there are differences in the conditions governing the import of these products into the Member States and these differences are capable of causing deflections of trade;
Whereas the Portuguese authorities have pointed out that, as a result of the abolition between Portugal and the Community of all quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effect concerning the movement of the products in question, there is a risk of trade in products originating in Japan being deflected through the other Member States towards Portugal; whereas such deflections are capable of aggravating the continuing difficulties affecting the sector concerned in Portugal thus putting at risk achievement of the objectives of the abovementioned trade measures;
Whereas the Commission has examined the application of the Portuguese Government and this examination has shown that Portugal should be authorized to introduce intra-Community surveillance of motor-cycles originating in Japan and put into free circulation in the other Member States;

(2) The Romanian government and the Commission, acting on behalf of the European Community, signed on 2 February 2001 the Multiannual Financing Agreement (hereinafter MAFA) laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Sapard Programme.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 provides that the ex ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 may be waived on the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance; Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2252/2001(5), provides for detailed rules for the carrying out of the said analysis.
(4) The competent authority of Romania has appointed the Sapard Agency, public institution with legal status, in the subordination of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. It will be responsible for implementing the following measures: ""Processing and Marketing of agricultural and fishery products"", ""Development and improvement of rural infrastructure"" and ""Technical assistance"" as defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development that was approved by Commission Decision C(2000) 3742 final on 12 December 2000, and amended by Commission Decision H/2002/1936 on 11 July 2002; whereas the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund has been established for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme.
(5) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, the Commission analysed the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance and considers that, for the implementation of the aforementioned measures, Romania complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(6) In particular, the Sapard Agency has implemented the following key accreditation criteria satisfactorily: written procedures, segregation of duties, pre-project approval and pre-payment checks, payment procedures, accounting procedures, computer security, internal audit, and, where appropriate, public procurement provisions.
(7) On 11 July 2002 the Romanian authorities provided the revised list of eligible expenditure in conformity with Article 4(1), Section B of the MAFA, and this did not give rise to objections by the Commission.
(8) The Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund has implemented the following criteria satisfactorily for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for Romania: audit trail, treasury management, receipt of funds, disbursements to the Sapard Agency, computer security and internal audit.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement referred to in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer on the Sapard Agency, and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund in Romania, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(10) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission are based on an operational, but not operating system, it is therefore appropriate to confer the management of the Sapard Programme on the Sapard Agency, and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.
(11) Full conferral of management of the Sapard Programme is only envisaged after further verifications, in order to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily, have been carried out and after any recommendations the Commission may issue, with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the Sapard Agency, and on the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, have been implemented.
(12) In order to take account of the requirements of Article 8(1)(b), Section A of the MAFA, expenditure pursuant to this Decision shall be eligible for Community co-finance only if incurred by beneficiaries from the date of this Decision or, if later, the date of the instrument making them a beneficiary for the project in question, except for feasibility and related studies, and for technical assistance, where this date shall be 12 December 2000, provided in all cases it is not paid by the Sapard Agency prior to the date of this Decision,","{'title': '2002/638/EC: Commission Decision of 31 July 2002 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development Romania in the pre-accession period', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe requirement of ex ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting by Romania is hereby waived.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nManagement of the Sapard Programme is conferred on a provisional basis to:\n\n1. the Sapard Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry of Romania, Negustori Street 1 B, Sector 2, RO Bucharest 2, for the implementation of measures ""Processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products"", ""Development and improvement of rural infrastructure"" and ""Technical assistance"" as defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development that was approved by Commission Decision C(2000) 3742 final on 12 December 2000, and amended by Commission Decision H/2002/1936, adopted on 11 July 2002; and\n\n2. the Ministry of Public Finance, National Fund, Apolodor Street 17, Sector 5, RO 70663 Bucharest, for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for Romania.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nExpenditure pursuant to this Decision shall be eligible for Community co-finance only if incurred by beneficiaries from the date of this Decision or, if later, the date of the instrument making them a beneficiary for the project in question, except for feasibility and related studies, and for technical assistance, where this date shall be 12 December 2000, provided in all cases it is not paid by the Sapard Agency prior to the date of this Decision.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 July 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 68.\n\n(2) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 87.\n\n(3) OJ L 342, 27.12.2001, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 253, 7.10.2000, p. 5.\n\n(5) OJ L 304, 21.11.2001, p. 8.'}]}"

Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
(3) The application of the above criteria gives the world market price for unginned cotton determined hereinafter,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2314/2002 of 20 December 2002 determining the world market price for unginned cotton', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe world price for unginned cotton as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 is hereby determined as equalling EUR 27,641/100 kg.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 21 December 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

(2) In view of the scientific opinions on the state of resources in the Mauritanian EEZ and, in particular, the results of the fourth and fifth working groups of the Mauritanian Institute of Oceanographic Research and Fisheries (IMROP) and of the joint scientific working group, and in the light of the conclusions drawn from those results at the meeting of the Joint Committee held on 10 September and 15 and 16 December 2004, the two parties have decided to amend the existing fishing opportunities.
(3) The outcome of those amendments has been the subject of an Exchange of Letters and involves a temporary reduction in the fishing effort for cephalopods (category 5), the fixing of a second closed period of one month for demersal fishing, and an increase in the number of pole-and-line tuna vessels and surface longliners (category 8) and pelagic freezer trawlers (category 9).
(4) So that those amendments to fishing opportunities can apply as soon as possible, the Agreement should, therefore, be signed in the form of an Exchange of Letters, subject to its definitive conclusion by the Council.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 (3) lays down specifications for food additives including colours and sweeteners that are listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.
(3) Those lists may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) On 6 October 2009, an application was submitted for authorisation of the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer in solid food supplements as binding/coating agent. The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.
(5) The European Food Safety Authority evaluated the safety of polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (4) when used as a food additive and concluded that the use of polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer in solid food supplements as a binding/coating agent is unlikely to be of safety concern at the proposed uses.
(6) There is a technological need for the addition of polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer to a cellulosic formulation in food supplements. It improves film toughness, increases coating application rates and promotes better film adhesion. It also enables a continuous coating process, thus reducing the time of the coating process. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of this additive as a glazing agent in solid food supplements and to assign E 1208 as E-number to polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer.
(7) The specifications for polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (E 1208) should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union lists of food additives laid down in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.

For each plan or programme a full set of forms has to be filled in. Form 1 sets out general information on the plan or programme concerned. In forms 2 to 6, each column describes an exceedance situation addressed by the plan or programme. An exceedance situation is defined by an exceedance area and the limit value (LV) plus the margin of tolerance (LV+MOT) that has been exceeded in that area. An exceedance area is a location or a collection of locations where the levels have been found to exceed an LV+MOT in the reference year. The reference year is the year in which the exceedance occurred that, following Article 8 of Directive 96/62/EC, gave rise to the obligation to prepare or implement the PP. Each row in forms 2 to 6 contains a descriptive element for the exceedance situation.\n\nAn exceedance area may be a composite of several locations where exceedance of the LV+MOT has been found in the reference year, provided that certain descriptive elements of these locations are comparable or identical. These descriptive elements are indicated in forms 2 to 6 by a merging code that is specified in box 1. For the descriptive elements that are allowed to be different for the locations, other codes are given in box 1; these codes specify how the different elements are to be aggregated.\n\nSummary descriptions of individual measures are given in form 7.\n\nBOX 1 Specification of how locations where the levels have been found to exceed an LV+MOT can be merged into a single exceedance situation: merging codes, which are given for each entry in the forms below\n\n>TABLE>\n\nFORM 1 General information on the plan or programme\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 1:\n\n1. Sub b:: The Member State shall be indicated using the following codes: Austria: AT; Belgium: BE; Denmark: DK; Finland: FI; France: FR; Germany: DE; Greece: EL; Ireland: IE; Italy: IT; Luxembourg: LU; Netherlands: NL; Portugal: PT; Spain: ES; Sweden: SE; United Kingdom: UK.\n\n2. Sub c:: The reference to the plan or programme shall be a complete and detailed reference to the document(s) in which the plan or programme is fully described. In addition, a web address may be given.\n\n3. Sub g:: The contact person is the person that the Commission must approach if it requires further information on any aspect of this reporting sheet.\n\nFORM 2 Description of the exceedance of the limit value\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 2:\n\n1. Sub a: Each exceedance situation shall be given a code number that is unique within the Member State.\n\n2. Sub b: The pollutant shall be indicated by ""SO2"", ""NO2"", ""PM10"", ""Pb"" for lead, ""C6H6"" for benzene and ""CO"".\n\n3. Sub c: The zone code shall be identical to the one submitted in the annual questionnaire 2001/839/EC of the reference year.\n\n4. Sub D: If the exceedance area extends over more than one city or municipality, all cities and municipalities where exceedance was found shall be mentioned, separated by a semicolon.\n\n5. Sub e: The limit value for which the LV+MOT was exceeded shall be identified as ""h"" (based on hourly means), ""d"" (daily means) or ""a"" (annual means).\n\n6. Sub f and h: If the exceedance has been found by modelling, the highest level in the exceedance area shall be given in this and the following forms.\n\n7. Sub i: The information should be given in the form ""year: concentration"". Entries for several years should be separated by a semicolon. Non-availability of data shall be indicated by ""n.a."", earlier communication by ""com."".\n\n8. Sub j: ""Code of the station where the exceedance was observed"" shall be the code that has been used in the annual questionnaire of the reference year (Commission Decision 2001/839/EC).\n\n9. Sub j: For ""geographical coordinates of the station"" and ""classification of the station"", the specifications that are already in use for the exchange of data under the exchange of information Decision 97/101/EC shall be used.\n\n10. Sub k: The codes for ""classification of station"" shall also be used for ""classification of the area"". If the exceedance area found by modelling includes more than one class, the class codes shall be given, separated by a semicolon.\n\n11. Sub l and m: The ""surface area (km2) above the LV"" indicates the size of the exceedance area concerned. It may be left blank for traffic stations or traffic areas. The ""length of road (km) where the level was above the LV"" shall only be given for exceedances at traffic stations or, in case of modelling, traffic areas. It indicates the total length of road sections where exceedance occurred on one or both sides.\n\n12. Sub n: ""Population exposure above the LV"" indicates an estimate of the average number of people present during the exceedance of the limit value.\n\nFORM 3 Analysis of the causes of exceedance of the limit value in the reference year\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 3:\n\n1. Sub b and c: The background level is the concentration of pollutants on a larger scale than the exceedance area. The regional background level is the level that is estimated to occur in the absence of sources within a distance of the order of 30 km. For locations in a city, this would be the background level in the absence of the city. For exceedance due to long-range transport of air pollution, the regional background can be equal to the exceedance reported in form 2. The total background is the level that is estimated to occur in the absence of local sources (with high chimneys within about 5 km and low sources within roughly 0,3 km - this distance could be smaller, e.g. for residential heating, or larger, e.g. for steel mills). The total background level includes the regional background level. In a city, the total background is the urban background, i.e. the level that would occur in the absence of significant sources in the immediate vicinity. In a rural area, the total background level is about equal to the regional background level.\n\n2. Sub d: The contributions of the local sources shall be expressed as a sequential number, using ""1"" for the largest contributor, ""2"" for the second largest contributor etc. Sources that do not contribute significantly shall be indicated by ""-"".\n\n3. Sub d: If the contribution of ""other"" sources has been indicated as significant, the source type(s) shall be clarified at the entry ""Comments for clarification"".\n\n4. Sub f: Exceptional local climatology shall be indicated by ""+"".\n\n5. Sub g: Exceptions local topography shall be indicated by ""+"".\n\nFORM 4 Baseline level\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 4:\n\n1. Form 4 shall be filled in for the limit value(s) whose LV+MOT has been exceeded.\n\n2. The baseline level is the concentration to be expected in the year when the limit value comes into force without any measures beyond those already agreed or implied by existing legislation.\n\nFORM 5 Details of measures beyond those already required by existing legislation\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNote to Form 5:\n\n1. Form 5 is to be completed only if the analysis required by form 4 shows that it is not expected that the limit values will be attained by measures already required by existing legislation.\n\n2. Sub b: Each measure must be indicated by a code, which refers to a measure described in form 7.\n\n3. Sub c: Keywords on the various implementation steps must be given followed by a date or period in the form ""mm/yy"". Entries must be separated by a semicolon.\n\n4. Sub e and f: The funding allocated refers to public funds alone; the estimated total costs include also the costs borne by the sector(s) affected.\n\nFORM 6 Possible measures that have not yet been taken and long-term measures (optional)\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 6:\n\n1. Sub b and d: Each measure must be indicated by a code, which refers to a measure described in form 7. If more than one measure is indicated, the codes must be separated by a semicolon.\n\n2. Sub c: The following codes are to be used to characterise the administrative level at which the measure could be taken: A: local; B: regional; C: national; D: European Union; E: international beyond European Union. If more than one level is appropriate, the codes must be separated by a semicolon.\n\nFORM 7 Summary of measures\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNotes to Form 7:\n\n1. Form 7 is to be used to describe the measures mentioned in forms 5 or 6. One column of Form 7 must be completed for each measure.\n\n2. Sub a: Each measure must be given a unique code.\n\n3. Sub c: The description of the measure is a free text of typically 100 to 200 words.\n\n4. Sub d: The following codes must be used to characterise the administrative level at which the measure could be taken: A: local; B: regional; C: national.\n\n5. Sub e: The following codes must be used to characterise the type of measure: A: economic/fiscal; B: technical; C: education/information; D: other.\n\n6. Sub g: The following codes must be used to characterise the time scale of the concentration reduction achieved by the measure: A: short term; B: medium term (about a year); C: long term.\n\n7. Sub h: The following codes must be used to characterise the source sector affected by the measure: A: transport; B: industry including heat and power production; C: agriculture; D: commercial and residential sources; E: other.\n\n8. Sub e and h: If the code for ""other"" is used, it must be clarified at the entry ""Comments for clarification"".\n\n9. Sub i: The following codes must be used to characterise the spatial scale of the sources affected by the measure:\n\n10.

Whereas Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1152/90 provides for the Community maximum guaranteed area to be determined for the three marketing years concerned by that Regulation; whereas that area is equal to the average area given over to cotton by small producers in 1987 and 1988; whereas, in view of the information received from the Member States, the area in question should be determined;
Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1152/90 provides for the aid to be granted in respect of areas sown and harvested; whereas, to ensure that the scheme functions correctly, some form of check on areas eligible for aid is required; whereas provision should be made for each small producer to submit an application for aid containing the information needed for verification that the areas in respect of which an application has been lodged have actually been harvested; whereas the check should take the form of random, on-the-spot inspections covering a sufficiently representative number of aid applications; whereas, however, in the case of applications lodged in respect of the 1989/90 marketing year, instead of making on-the-spot inspections, Member States should verify the extent to which the areas in respect of which applications have been lodged tally with the quantities of unginned cotton placed under supervised storage in ginning plants;
Whereas in order to ensure that the system of aid is applied correctly, it is necessary to provide for a penalty in cases where applications for aid are submitted by producers who are not eligible because the area they have given over to cotton exceeds the 2,5 hectare limit;
Whereas under Article 7 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1152/90 the Commission must record any overrun in the maximum guaranteed area and determine the resulting reduction in the aid; whereas, to facilitate such recording and determination, Member States should notify to the Commission after the check has been made the areas in respect of which aid is to be granted;
Whereas, to reduce the disadvantages to interested parties of late payment of the aid, time limits should be laid down for the recording of overruns in the maximum guaranteed area, the determination of any reduction in the aid and payment of the aid;

The IFRS Interpretations Committee received requests for guidance on the accounting for levies in the financial statements of the entity that is paying the levy. The question relates to when to recognise a liability to pay a levy that is accounted for in accordance with IAS 37\nProvisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n.\nSCOPE\n2.\nThis Interpretation addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy if that liability is within the scope of IAS 37. It also addresses the accounting for a liability to pay a levy whose timing and amount is certain.\n3.\nThis Interpretation does not address the accounting for the costs that arise from recognising a liability to pay a levy. Entities should apply other Standards to decide whether the recognition of a liability to pay a levy gives rise to an asset or an expense.\n4.\nFor the purposes of this Interpretation, a levy is an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that is imposed by governments on entities in accordance with legislation (i.e. laws and/or regulations), other than:\n(a)\nthose outflows of resources that are within the scope of other Standards (such as income taxes that are within the scope of IAS 12\nIncome Taxes\n); and\n(b)\nfines or other penalties that are imposed for breaches of the legislation.\n‘Government’ refers to government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.\n5.\nA payment made by an entity for the acquisition of an asset, or for the rendering of services under a contractual agreement with a government, does not meet the definition of a levy.\n6.\nAn entity is not required to apply this Interpretation to liabilities that arise from emissions trading schemes.\nISSUES\n7.\nTo clarify the accounting for a liability to pay a levy, this Interpretation addresses the following issues:\n(a)\nwhat is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy?\n(b)\ndoes economic compulsion to continue to operate in a future period create a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in that future period?\n(c)\ndoes the going concern assumption imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period?\n(d)\ndoes the recognition of a liability to pay a levy arise at a point in time or does it, in some circumstances, arise progressively over time?\n(e)\nwhat is the obligating event that gives rise to the recognition of a liability to pay a levy that is triggered if a minimum threshold is reached?\n(f)\nare the principles for recognising in the annual financial statements and in the interim financial report a liability to pay a levy the same?\nCONSENSUS\n8.\nThe obligating event that gives rise to a liability to pay a levy is the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation. For example, if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy is the generation of revenue in the current period and the calculation of that levy is based on the revenue that was generated in a previous period, the obligating event for that levy is the generation of revenue in the current period. The generation of revenue in the previous period is necessary, but not sufficient, to create a present obligation.\n9.\nAn entity does not have a constructive obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period as a result of the entity being economically compelled to continue to operate in that future period.\n10.\nThe preparation of financial statements under the going concern assumption does not imply that an entity has a present obligation to pay a levy that will be triggered by operating in a future period.\n11.\nThe liability to pay a levy is recognised progressively if the obligating event occurs over a period of time (i.e. if the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation, occurs over a period of time). For example, if the obligating event is the generation of revenue over a period of time, the corresponding liability is recognised as the entity generates that revenue.\n12.\nIf an obligation to pay a levy is triggered when a minimum threshold is reached, the accounting for the liability that arises from that obligation shall be consistent with the principles established in paragraphs 8-14 of this Interpretation (in particular, paragraphs 8 and 11). For example, if the obligating event is the reaching of a minimum activity threshold (such as a minimum amount of revenue or sales generated or outputs produced), the corresponding liability is recognised when that minimum activity threshold is reached.\n13.\nAn entity shall apply the same recognition principles in the interim financial report that it applies in the annual financial statements. As a result, in the interim financial report, a liability to pay a levy:\n(a)\nshall not be recognised if there is no present obligation to pay the levy at the end of the interim reporting period; and\n(b)\nshall be recognised if a present obligation to pay the levy exists at the end of the interim reporting period.\n14.\nAn entity shall recognise an asset if it has prepaid a levy but does not yet have a present obligation to pay that levy.\n(\n*1\n)\n‘Reproduction allowed within the European Economic Area.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (1), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC (2), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(4) The request to recognise that the ‘KZR INiG System’ demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was first submitted to the Commission on 17 July 2012. The scheme version that was accepted was submitted on 17 December 2013. The scheme covers raw materials cultivated and harvested in the EU as well as wastes and residues from the EU. The scheme covers the entire supply chain from raw material production to the distribution of biofuels. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.
(5) Assessment of the ‘KZR INiG System’ found it to cover adequately the sustainability criteria of Directive 98/70/EC and of Directive 2009/28/EC, as well as applying a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(6) The evaluation of the ‘KZR INiG System’ found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing and also complies with the methodological requirements in Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(7) The ‘KZR INiG System’ was assessed against legislation in force at the time of the adoption of this Commission Implementing Decision. In the case of relevant changes in the legal basis the Commission will assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Following enlargement of the European Union on 1 May 2004 the Community and Switzerland agreed on 19 May 2004 on the principle that the trade flows in accordance with the preferences granted previously under the bilateral arrangements between the new Member States and Switzerland should be maintained after enlargement. The Parties therefore agreed to adapt the tariff concessions laid down in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 21 June 1999 on trade in agricultural products (1) (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement), which entered into force on 1 June 2002. The adaptation of these concessions, which are listed in Annexes 1 and 2 to the Agreement, includes the widening of an existing duty-free Community tariff quota (products of CN codes 0705 11 00, 0705 19 00 and 0705 29 00, under the order number 09.0925) to cover a new product (CN code 0705 21 00).
(2) It has been agreed by the Parties, on the basis of reciprocity, that the changes to bilateral tariff concessions should be applied retroactively from 1 May 2004. Since the procedure for adopting bilaterally a decision to amend Annexes 1 and 2 to the Agreement will not be completed immediately, the Parties agreed to provide for the application of those concessions on an autonomous and transitional basis as from 1 May 2004.
(3) To ensure that quota benefit for products of CN code 0705 21 00 is available from 1 May 2004, a new Community tariff quota limited to those products should be provided for during a transitional period, without prejudice to continued access for other products within the framework of the existing tariff quota laid down in the Agreement and in Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/2002 of 31 May 2002 opening and providing for the management of tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in Switzerland, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 851/95 (2).
(4) To be eligible for the benefit of this tariff quota, products must originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement.
(5) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3) provides for a system for managing tariff quotas. The tariff quota opened by this Regulation should be managed by the Commission and the Member States in accordance with that system.

COMMISSION DECISION
of 13 May 2011
accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina
(2011/279/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EU) No 1036/2010 (2), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Union of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
(2) Following the adoption of the provisional anti-dumping measures, the Commission continued the investigation of dumping, injury and Union interest. The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to these imports.
(3) The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EU) No 464 of 11 May 2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina (3) (the ‘product concerned’).
B.   UNDERTAKING
(4) Subsequent to the adoption of provisional anti-dumping measures, the cooperating exporting producer in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik, together with its related company in the Union, AB Kauno Tiekimas filialas ‘Kauno Tiekimas’, located in Kaunas, Lithuania, offered a price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. In this undertaking offer, both companies offered to sell the product concerned at or above price levels which eliminate the injurious effects of dumping found during the investigation.
(5) The minimum import price (MIP) offer from the companies was based on the normal value calculated for the investigation period.
(6) The undertaking offer also contained the provision that the sales of the product concerned would be shipped directly from Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik to the first independent customer in the Union and invoiced either from Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik to the first independent customer in the Union or invoiced directly by Kauno. Furthermore, the companies offered to establish a link between the transfer invoices concerning the product concerned issued by Alumina d.o.o Zvornik to Kauno Tiekimas and the resale invoices to the first independent customer in the Union by Kauno Tiekimas.
(7) Both companies also agreed to undertake to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning their sales to the Union, allowing for the undertaking to be monitored effectively by the Commission.
C.   COMMENTS OF PARTIES AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
(8) The Union industry indicated that it disagrees with the acceptance of an undertaking offer, in particular with a fixed MIP. It was argued that prices of zeolite A powder depend on cost of raw materials, especially caustic soda, and energy and that the market prices are expected to rise. In this respect it is noted that available information concerning the evolution of the cost of production (which includes raw materials and energy costs) confirms that the evolution was linear. The information gathered throughout the investigation suggest that the prices of main raw materials did not change dramatically with exception to the caustic soda in the mid-2009, however this trend was reversed towards the end of 2009 and prices returned to long-time average. Furthermore, energy is not a raw material input and could not be linked with a MIP. The Union industry disputed whether the Bosnian exporting producer and its related company in the Union could be considered trustworthy, account taken of their financial situation. Nevertheless, no concrete and verifiable information was provided to corroborate this claim. The trustworthiness of the aforesaid parties was also questioned since it was argued that they declared on importation the product concerned under various CN codes. In this respect, it is noted that the product concerned is currently falling within CN code ex 2842 10 00 and that the customs declaration is not carried out by the companies offering the undertaking. It was also argued that the Bosnian exporting producer may sell other products in the Union, thus, increasing the danger of cross compensation and that the related company in the Union may provide compensation to its Union clients when selling the product under MIP. In this respect, it is noted that the Commission has not established any systemic danger of cross compensation, in particular as the market and clients for zeolite A powder is well defined. Indeed, the clients that purchase zeolite A powder do not purchase any other products produced by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik since they operate in completely different markets than the customers of the other products. In this respect, it is emphasised that all parties subject to this undertaking offer will be closely monitored. The Union industry also submitted that the undertaking offer was not submitted within the time period foreseen under the basic Regulation. In this respect, it is noted that the offer was indeed submitted within the time frame period foreseen under Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. The Union industry submitted some additional comments concerning the calculation method of the MIP and the monitoring of such undertaking, which were however not considered pertinent or justified since the Commission ensured that the proposed MIP is in line with its administrative practices followed with respect to undertaking offers.
(9) In view of the above, the undertaking offered by the two companies is acceptable.
(10) In order to enable the Commission to effectively monitor the companies’ compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional on (i) the presentation of an undertaking invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 464; (ii) the fact that the imported goods are manufactured by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik and shipped directly by it to the first independent customer in the Union and invoiced to the first independent customer in the Union either directly by Alumina d.o.o. Zvornik or Kauno Tiekimas and (iii) the fact that the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the undertaking invoice. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable.
(11) To ensure that the undertaking is respected, importers have been made aware by the Council Regulation mentioned above in recital 3 that the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided for by that Regulation, or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertaking, may lead to a customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions.
(12) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the anti-dumping duty imposed in accordance with Article 9(4) of the basic Regulation shall automatically apply pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '14.5.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 May 2011\naccepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n(2011/279/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe undertaking offered by the exporting producer, together with its related importer in the Union mentioned below in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of zeolite A powder originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina is hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTaric Additional Code\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nManufactured, shipped and invoiced directly by Alumina d.o.o., Zvornik, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the first independent customer in the Union\nB115\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nManufactured and shipped directly by Alumina d.o.o., Zvornik, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the first independent customer in the Union and invoiced directly by AB Kauno Tiekimas filialas, Kaunas, Lithuania to the first independent customer in the Union\nB116'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the views expressed by the Member States and the organizations representing inland waterway carriers at Community level in the consultations held by the Commission on 23 November 1990 in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No  1101/89,
Whereas with German unification Germany's inland waterway fleet capacity has increased by the number of vessels that were registered in the former German Democratic Republic at the date of unification; whereas this increase in capacity could jeopardize  the measures taken at Community level to bring about structural improvements in the Member States' inland waterway transport;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, the German Government, in its communication of 9 November 1990, requested the Commission, with a view to reducing the capacity of the vessels of its fleet which formed part of that of  the former German Democratic Republic, to organize a scrapping scheme in addition to that carried out as of 1 January 1990 under the terms of Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No  3685/89 (4);
Whereas the scrapping operation must be based on the same principles as those set out in the said Regulations, although account should also be taken of the economic situation and the structure of the fleet of German vessels registered in the former  German Democratic Republic at the date of German unification;
Whereas a 20 % reduction in the fleet's overall capacity is considered necessary to attain the objective pursued by the additional scrapping scheme; whereas because of the special situation with regard to the ownership of the vessels of the fleet, the  premium-rate percentage system provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89 should be abandoned as far as fixing the rates of the scrapping premiums is concerned and the rates of those premiums should be determined for the different types  and categories of inland waterway craft on the basis of the average rate paid per tonne or kW scrapped under the scrapping scheme begun on 1 January 1990;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89 applies to German vessels registered in the former German Democratic Republic at the date of German unification; whereas it is therefore necessary to amend that Regulation,",{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 317/91 of 8 February 1991 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89 laying down certain measures for implementing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport'}

The second subparagraph of Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union enshrines the concept of openness, stating that the Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen.
In the Joint Declaration (3) relating to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (4), the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission call on the other institutions to adopt internal rules on public access to documents which take account of the principles and limits set out in that Regulation.
The provisions laid down in Decision No 18/97 of the Court of Auditors laying down internal rules for the treatment of applications for access to documents held by the Court (5) antedate Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 and should be revised in the light of that Regulation and of the case-law of the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance.
Openness enhances the administration’s legitimacy, effectiveness and accountability, thus strengthening the principles of democracy. To that end good administrative practice on access to documents should be promoted.
However, certain public and private interests should be protected by way of exceptions to the principle of public access to documents. In particular international auditing standards concerning the confidential nature of audit information must be duly respected,","{'header': '20.4.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 96/1', 'title': 'DECISION No 12-2005\nof 10\xa0March\xa02005\nregarding public access to Court of Auditors documents\n(2005/C 96/01)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COURT OF AUDITORS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Purpose', 'text': 'Article 1\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this Decision is to define the conditions, limits and procedures under which the Court of Auditors shall give public access to documents which it holds.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Beneficiaries and scope', 'text': 'Article 2\nBeneficiaries and scope\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Within the framework and limits of the provisions laid down in this Decision and of international standards governing the confidentiality of audit information, any citizen of the Union and any other natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State, has a right of access to documents of the Court of Auditors, subject to the principles, conditions and limits defined in this Decision.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Court of Auditors may, subject to the same principles, conditions and limits, grant access to documents to any natural or legal person not residing or not having its registered office in a Member State.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision shall apply to all documents held by the Court of Auditors, that is to say, documents drawn up or received by it and in its possession.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision shall be without prejudice to rights of public access to documents held by the Court of Auditors which might follow from instruments of international law or Community acts implementing them.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Definitions', 'text': 'Article 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purpose of this Decision:\n(a)\n‘document’ shall mean any content, whatever its medium (written on paper or stored in electronic form or as a sound, visual or audiovisual recording);\n(b)\n‘third party’ shall mean any natural or legal person, or any entity outside the Court of Auditors, including the Member States, other Community or non-Community institutions and bodies and third countries.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'subtitle': 'Exceptions', 'text': 'Article 4\nExceptions\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Court of Auditors shall refuse access to a document where disclosure would undermine the protection of:\n(a)\nthe public interest including:\n—\npublic security,\n—\ndefence and military matters,\n—\ninternational relations,\n—\nthe financial, monetary or economic policy of the Community or a Member State;\n(b)\nprivacy and integrity of the individual, in particular in accordance with Community legislation regarding the protection of personal data.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0In accordance with the rules governing confidentiality laid down in Articles 143(2) and 144(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities and in corresponding provisions in other instruments of Community law, the Court of Auditors shall refuse access to its audit observations.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Commission Directive 2003/119/EC (2) propoxycarbazone was included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) When applying for the inclusion of propoxycarbazone its manufacturer Bayer CropScience gave a specification based on small-scale production. For large-scale production, that company now intends to modify the specification as regards purity. It has submitted data to show that the modified specification fulfils the requirements for inclusion.
(3) Germany evaluated the information and data submitted by the company. It informed the Commission in July 2005 that it concludes that the modified specification does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the entry for propoxycarbazone in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance.
(4) Therefore it is justified to modify the specification of propoxycarbazone.
(5) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '18.5.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 130/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/45/EC\nof 16 May 2006\namending Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards the specification of the active substance propoxycarbazone\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Commission Directive 2003/119/EC(2)propoxycarbazone was included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((2)) When applying for the inclusion of propoxycarbazone its manufacturer Bayer CropScience gave a specification based on small-scale production.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 33(2) thereof,

(1) Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(b) of that Regulation and prices for those products on the Community market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the sugar market, export refunds should therefore be fixed in accordance with the rules and certain criteria provided for in Articles 32 and 33 of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund according to destination.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Community and that comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(5) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For those two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.
