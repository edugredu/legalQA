Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 of 13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (1), and in particular Article 5(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Commission Decision 2004/370/EC (2), the use of three methods for grading pig carcases in Northern Ireland has been authorised.
(2) Due to technical adaptations, the United Kingdom has requested the Commission to authorise in Northern Ireland the use of new formulae for two apparata used for grading pig carcases and to authorise two new methods for grading pig carcases, and has therefore submitted the elements required in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases (3). As the apparatus ‘Fat-O-Meater’ has never been used in Northern Ireland, it should be deleted from the scope of this Decision concerning Northern Ireland.
(3) The evaluation of this request has revealed that the conditions for using the new formulae and the new methods are fulfilled.
(4) Decision 2004/370/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Pigmeat,","{'header': '16.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 46/34', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 3 February 2006\namending Decision 2004/370/EC authorising methods for grading pig carcases in the United Kingdom\n(notified under document number C(2006) 213)\n(Only the English text is authentic)\n(2006/99/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Commission Decision 2004/370/EC(2), the use of three methods for grading pig carcases in Northern Ireland has been authorised.\n\n((2)) Due to technical adaptations, the United Kingdom has requested the Commission to authorise in Northern Ireland the use of new formulae for two apparata used for grading pig carcases and to authorise two new methods for grading pig carcases, and has therefore submitted the elements required in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases(3).

Having regard to Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11(2) of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Finnish authorities notified to the Commission and to the other Member States a measure relating to a screw conveyor for carrots and kohlrabi of the type TSF 350 manufactured by Cabinplant A/S, Foresbjergvej 9, 5683 Haarby, Denmark. The machinery bore the CE marking and was accompanied by an EC Declaration of conformity.
(2) The measure was motivated by the non-conformity of the machinery with the following essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC:
— 1.3.7 — Risks related to moving parts
— 1.3.8 — Choice of protection against risks arising from moving parts
— 1.4.2.2 — Interlocking moveable guards
— 2.1.1 (d) and (e) — Foodstuffs machinery — cleaning.
(3) The measure followed an accident that occurred during cleaning of the machinery when the operator reached into the drainpipe of the conveyor to free blocked vegetables while the screw was running, sustaining injuries to his fingers. The flap preventing access to the drain pipe was a fixed guard. Since it had to be opened several times per day for cleaning, the Finnish authorities considered that an interlocking moveable guard should be fitted. Furthermore, the Finnish authorities noted that the machine could not be effectively cleaned while at a standstill as specified in the instructions.
(4) In accordance with Article 11(3) of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Commission asked the manufacturer Cabinplant A/S to present his observations on the measure. The manufacturer replied that the type TSF 350 screw conveyor had been designed and manufactured by a supplier and purchased by Cabinplant A/S for fitting into an integrated system. He stated if future screw conveyors of this type were purchased he would ensure that they complied with the requirements of Directive 2006/42/EC.
(5) Examination of the evidence provided by the Finnish authorities and of the observations communicated by the manufacturer confirms that the screw conveyor of the type TSF 350 not fitted with an interlocking moveable guard to prevent access to the drainpipe while the screw is running fails to comply with the essential health and safety requirements of Annex I to Directive 2006/42/EC and that this non-conformity gives rise to a serious risk of injury to operators,","{'header': '11.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 270/5', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 9 October 2013\non a measure taken by Finland according to Article 11 of Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to a screw conveyor for carrots and kohlrabi\n(notified under document C(2013) 6392)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2013/494/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with the procedure set out in Article 11(2) of Directive 2006/42/EC, the Finnish authorities notified to the Commission and to the other Member States a measure relating to a screw conveyor for carrots and kohlrabi of the type TSF 350 manufactured by Cabinplant A/S, Foresbjergvej 9, 5683 Haarby, Denmark.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas the situation in Italy, Greece and Spain respectively has been the subject of special examination; whereas as regards those three Member States the conclusions from the examination permit extending the increase in the guaranteed total quantity  laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 3950/92 (3), but solely for the period 1994/95 in the case of Italy and Greece, and to consolidate it for Spain; whereas there will be a re-examination before the beginning of the period 1995/96 as to  whether all the conditions to which the definitive increase in the total quantity for Italy and Greece is subject have been fully satisfied;
Whereas the checks carried out in Italy, covered all milk producers and thus permit, in the light of full knowledge, extending, for the period 1994/95, the increase in the guaranteed total quantity granted for the period 1993/94; whereas, however, part  of that increase should be reserved, namely 347 701 tonnes, for allocating, as need arises, reference quantities to producers when certain conditions are satisfied;

COMMISSION DECISION
of 12 November 2008
on a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Kenya with regard to tuna loins
(notified under document number C(2008) 6644)
(2008/886/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007 applying the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements (1), and in particular Article 36(4) of Annex II thereto,
Whereas:
(1) On 5 August 2008 Kenya requested, in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, a derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for a period of one year. On 19 August 2008 Kenya submitted additional information relating to its request. The request covers a total quantity of 2 000 tonnes of tuna loins of HS heading 1604. The request is made because catches and supply of originating raw tuna have decreased in the Indian Ocean.
(2) According to the information provided by Kenya catches of raw originating tuna are unusually low even compared to the normal seasonal variations and have led to a decrease in production of tuna loins. This abnormal situation makes it impossible for Kenya to comply with the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 during a certain period.
(3) In order to ensure that Kenya may continue its exports to the European Community, following the expiration of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (2), a new derogation should be granted.
(4) To ensure smooth transition from the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement to the Agreement establishing a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the East African Community partner States, on the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other part (EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement), a new derogation should be granted with retroactive effect from 1 January 2008.
(5) A temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 would not cause serious injury to an established Community industry taking into account the imports concerned, provided that certain conditions relating to quantities, surveillance and duration are respected.
(6) It is therefore justified to grant a temporary derogation under Article 36(1)(a) of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007.
(7) Kenya will benefit from an automatic derogation from the rules of origin for tuna loins of HS heading 1604 pursuant to Article 41(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, when that Agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied.
(8) In accordance with Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 the rules of origin set out in Annex II to that Regulation and the derogations from them are to be superseded by the rules of the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, the entry into force or provisional application of which is expected to take place in 2008. The derogation should therefore apply until 31 December 2008, as requested by Kenya, unless the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement enters into force or is applied provisionally before that date.
(9) In accordance with Article 41(8) of the Origin Protocol attached to the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement, the automatic derogation from the rules of origin is limited to an annual quota of 2 000 tonnes of tuna loins for the countries having initialled the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement (Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ruanda, Burundi). Kenya is the only country in the region that currently exports tuna loins to the Community. It is therefore appropriate to grant to Kenya a derogation under Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 in respect of 2 000 tonnes of tuna loins, quantity which does not exceed the full annual quota granted to the EAC region under the EAC-EU Interim Partnership Agreement.
(10) Accordingly a derogation should be granted to Kenya in respect of 2 000 tonnes of tuna loins for a period of one year.
(11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (3) lays down rules relating to the management of tariff quotas. In order to ensure efficient management carried out in close cooperation between the authorities of Kenya, the customs authorities of the Member States and the Commission, those rules should apply mutatis mutandis to the quantities imported under the derogation granted by this Decision.
(12) In order to allow efficient monitoring of the operation of the derogation, the authorities of Kenya should communicate regularly to the Commission details of the EUR.1 movement certificates issued.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '27.11.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 317/16', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 12 November 2008\non a temporary derogation from the rules of origin laid down in Annex II to Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 to take account of the special situation of Kenya with regard to tuna loins\n(notified under document number C(2008) 6644)\n(2008/886/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 5 August 2008 Kenya requested, in accordance with Article 36 of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007, a derogation from the rules of origin set out in that Annex for a period of one year.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common  organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No  1265/95  (2), and in particular Article 5 (1) and (9) and Article 5a (4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3901/89 of 12 December 1989 defining lambs fattened as  heavy carcases  (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1266/95  (4),
Whereas the last subparagraph of Article 5a (4) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 stipulates that  the provision whereby, in the case of a transfer of premium rights without transfer of the holding,  a part of the premium rights is to be surrendered without compensation to the national reserve does  not apply to members of the same producer groups meeting certain conditions to be determined by the  Commission in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 30; whereas, in order to  prevent irregularities, minimum conditions should consequently be laid down, the Member States  being authorized, where applicable, to lay down additional conditions; whereas the penalties  applying where such conditions are not met should also be specified;
Whereas the third and following subparagraphs of Article 5b (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89  provide for the establishment of special reserves with a ceiling of 600  000 rights for both Italy  and Greece to permit them to grant additional rights to certain producers; whereas that Regulation  lays down criteria for identifying such producers and for determining their additional rights and  provides for a verification procedure by the Commission; whereas to that end provision should be  made for a single centralized register to be kept by each Member State so that the producers  concerned can be located and all the details needed for such verification are available; whereas,  in addition, the penultimate subparagraph of the abovementioned Article 5b (1) provides that such  verification must ensure that the additional rights will be allocated in such a way that such  producers do not ultimately obtain more rights than would have been granted them had the situation  which led to the creation of additional rights not occurred; whereas to that end provision should  be made for the contribution referred to in the first subparagraph of abovementioned Article 5b (1)  not to be included in the national reserve so that producers other than those referred to above may  not benefit under the measure provided for in this Regulation;
Whereas the newly created additional rights constitute compensation by virtue of the fact that in  Italy and Greece, 1991, which was the reference marketing year for determining rights, coincided  with the switchover between two different premium systems resulting in under-estimation of rights;  whereas the producers receiving such additional rights should not therefore be penalized by  applying to them the condition laid down in Article 6 (1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3567/92   (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1847/95  (6);
Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 1 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3901/89 provides for the  introduction of a simplified procedure for verification of fattening as heavy carcases with regard  to lambs belonging to a limited number of meat breeds reared in geographically well-defined areas;  whereas to that end Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2814/90 of 28 September 1990 laying down  detailed rules for the definition of lambs fattened as heavy carcases  (7), as last amended by  Regulation (EC) No 277/94  (8), should be amended to simplify the administrative verification  procedure laid down while maintaining the obligation on producers to show they have actually  fattened as heavy carcases all lambs born on their holdings; whereas that obligation may be deemed  to have been fulfilled where a check shows that the lambs present as a percentage of the ewes is  above a minimum threshold determined by reference to normal breeding practice for the breeds and  areas concerned;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3), and in particular Articles 143(2) and 144(1) thereof,
Whereas:
the second subparagraph of Article 1 of the Treaty on European Union enshrines the concept of openness, stating that the Treaty marks a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen;
in the Joint Declaration (4) relating to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (5), the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission call on the other institutions to adopt internal rules on public access to documents which take account of the principles and limits set out in that Regulation;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Articles 30 and 75  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Articles 30 and 75 of the Act of Accession, the customs duties applicable to  imports into the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 of the following product coming from  Spain are to be phased out within the limits of a Community tariff quota of 200 tonnes of dried  figs falling within CN code ex 0804  20  90; whereas on 1 January 1991, the duties in question are  to be reduced to 25  % of the basic duties; whereas the said basic duties are those laid down by  Council Regulation (EEC) No 4161/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down, consequent on the entry into  force of the combined nomenclature, the basic duties to be adopted within the Community as  constituted at 31 December 1985 for the purpose of calculating the successive reductions provided  for in the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal  (1); whereas the said tariff quotas should  therefore be opened for 1991;
Whereas, by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2573/90 of 5 September 1990 totally suspending certain  customs duties applicable by the Community of Ten to imports from Spain and Portugal  (2) which  concerns the products referred to in Annex II to the Treaty, with the exception of those referred  to by Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81  (3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2886/89   (4), the said duties are totally suspended from the time they reach a level of 2  % or less;

Having regard to Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (1), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
After consulting the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers,
Whereas:
(1) Following the publication of a scientific study in 2001, entitled ‘Use of permanent hair dyes and bladder cancer risk’, the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (the SCCNFP) concluded that the potential risks were of concern. It recommended that the Commission take further steps to control the use of hair dye chemicals.
(2) The SCCNFP recommended in addition an overall safety assessment strategy for hair dyes including the requirements for testing hair dye cosmetic ingredients for their potential genotoxicity/mutagenicity.
(3) Following the opinions of the SCCNFP, the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders agreed on an overall strategy to regulate hair dyes according to which the industry was required to submit the files with scientific data on hair dyes to be evaluated by the SCCNFP.
(4) As a first step in the implementation of the strategy it was decided to give priority to permanent hair dye substances for which no explicit interest was expressed during the public consultation in defence of their use in hair dyes. Those substances should therefore be banned.
(5) According to the opinion of the SCCNFP, certain azo dyes pose a risk to the health of the consumer. They were therefore deleted from the positive list of colouring agents allowed for use in cosmetic products in Annex IV to Directive 76/768/EEC. For the same reason they should also be banned for use in hair dyes.
(6) For hair dye substances provisionally allowed in part 2 of Annex III to Directive 76/768/EEC the provisional period should be extended.
(7) Annexes II and III to Directive 76/768/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
1. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(3) (hereinafter ""the anti-dumping Regulation"") and 1891/97(4) (hereinafter ""the countervailing Regulation""), definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties (hereinafter ""the duties"") were imposed on imports of farmed (other than wild Atlantic salmon from Norway (hereinafter ""salmon""), with the exception of imports of salmon exported by the companies from which undertakings had been accepted by the Commission. The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty was set at EUR 0,32(5) per kilo net product weight, and the rate of the definitive countrvailing duty at the level of 3,8 % ad valorem applicable to the net free-at-Community-frontier price, before duties.
(2) By Decision 97/634/EC(6), the Commission accepted an undertaking from the Kingdom of Norway and price undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters.
(3) Pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter ""the basic anti-dumping Regulation"") and Article 13(9) and (10) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (hereinafter ""the basic countervailing Regulation""), provisional(7) and/or definitive(8) anti-dumping and countervailing duties have been imposed on imports of salmon exported by a number of companies which have either violated or withdrawn their undertakings. The duty rates applied in all these cases are those mentioned in recital 1 above.
2. REVIEW INVESTIGATION
(4) In the course of the monitoring of the price undertakings by the Commission, it became apparent that the effectiveness of the different measures was being undermined as, under certain circumstances, certain exporters which were not subject to the price undertakings were able to sell salmon on the Community market at injurious prices, even after payment of the duties. This situation increased the risk that other exporters which were bound by undertakings would almost be forced to lower their prices to compete with these comparatively cheap imports would therefore act in violation of their undertakings. With more than 80 % of salmon being exported by companies bound by undertakings, this would therefore undermine the overall effectiveness of the existing measures.
(5) Therefore, the Commission announced, by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(9), the initiation of an ex officio investigation pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 19(1) of the basic countervailing Regulation in order to review the possibility of a change in the form of the duties so that imports of salmon at injurious prices would be prevented.
(6) The Commission advised the producers, exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the producing and exporting industries in Norway, and the complainant Community producers of the initiation of the review investigation. In the notice of initiation, the Commission already indicated that, for low priced imports, the form of the duties might be changed to a variable duty at the level published in that notice. Interested parties were given an opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within a set time limit. Several parties made comments in writing but no hearings were requested.
3. APPRAISAL OF THE CURRENT MARKET SITUATION
(7) It should first be recalled that the product concerned by the proceeding is farmed Atlantic salmon, whether or not filleted, fresh, chilled or frozen, currently classified under CN codes ex 0302 12 00, ex 0304 10 13, ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 12, corresponding to fresh or chilled whole fish, fresh or chilled fillets, frozen whole fish, and frozen fillets, respectively.
(8) In monitoring the undertakings, the Commission found that during the second half of 1998, the price level reported for exports of salmon gradually deteriorated, on a weekly basis, to a level which was below the non-injurious price level established during the investigations which led to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This development is confirmed by the Norwegian export statistics and by wholesale selling prices found in the Community. The prices of salmon imports from Norway were therefore lower than could have been expected after the imposition of the original measures and under normal market conditions.
(9) The monitoring of the undertakings and the present investigation have shown that the downward price pressure towards an injurious level was caused, to a large extent, by Norwegian exporters not bound by price undertakings which started to sell salmon at prices which, even after payment of the duties, are below the non-injurious price level. Indeed, as was established during the investigations which led to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures, salmon is traded as a commodity in a relatively transparent and competitive market.
Under these market conditions, increasing sales of salmon on the Community market at prices below the non-injurious price levels set in the undertakings would make it more and more difficult for exporters bound by undertakings to continue to respect their price obligations. Consequently, these exporters find themselves under pressure to act in breach of their undertakings by selling at an injurious price level, or face a situation where their market share is lost to other exporters which sell outside the framework of the undertakings at an injurious price level. The Community industry, the Norwegian Government and the Norwegian producers and exporters associations all shared this assessment.
(10) In addition, comments received from certain Norwegian exporters on the findings of the present review investigation also corroborate this assessment. All parties which made submissions following the initiation of the present investigation confirmed that the measures had not led to the intended price stabilisation, and most of them supported the need to review the form of the duties.
(11) It is therefore concluded that, in their current form, the duties are not having the intended effect, notably as regards underpinning the undertakings, which were initially accepted from all known exporters and thus constitute the principal measure adopted to counteract injurious dumping and subsidisation.
4. REVISION OF THE FORM OF DUTIES
(12) It is the purpose of anti-dumping or countervailing measures to eliminate injurious dumping or subsidisation respectively. The choice of the appropriate form of anti-dumping or countervailing duties for achieving this purpose depends on the circumstances of the case under consideration.
(13) Since the early 1990s, the Community salmon market has suffered recurrent crises caused by abnormally low import prices. Therefore, on the basis of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3687/91 of 28 November 1991 on the common organisation of the market in fishery products(10), the Community, starting with Regulation (EEC) No 3270/91(11), repeatedly established minimum prices, initially for Atlantic salmon and, since March 1994, for farmed Atlantic salmon. In December 1995, on the basis of Articles 112(1) and 113(3) of the Agreement on the European Economic Area(12), a safeguard measure in the form of a floor price was imposed on farmed Atlantic salmon by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2907/95(13). Customs investigations revealed that, over the whole period, the declared values on importation frequently did not correspond with the prices actually charged by the Norwegian exporters to independent EU customers(14). It was noted, that this happened particularly where salmon was traded between related parties in Norway and the Community.
(14) Based on the above experience, it was decided in 1997 to impose the anti-dumping duty in the form of a specific duty, and the countervailing duty in the form of an ad valorem duty in order to ensure the effectiveness of these duties. Given the prevalence of trade between related parties, these duties should, in principle, be maintained to prevent circumvention of the duties.
(15) However, the present investigation has shown that these duties leave open the possibility for exporters not bound by undertaking to export salmon at very low prices, which is likely to prejudice respect for the undertakings and thus their continued general use.
(16) The current form of the duties should therefore be partially revised in order to deal with such low priced imports and thereby ensure that all salmon originating in Norway is imported at a non-injurious price level. Consequently, in circumstances where the existing duties would be insufficient to ensure a non-injurious import price, the anti-dumping duty should be replaced by a minimum price and become a variable duty.
(17) Salmon is commonly traded in different presentations (gutted head-on, gutted head-off, whole fish fillets, other fillets or fillet portions, or off-cuts or trimmings). Therefore, when translating the existing duties into their new form, a non-injurious minimum price level had to be established for each of these presentations with a view to ensuring a level of protection similar to the minimum prices set in the undertakings. The different minimum prices are essentially derived from the weight conversion factor relevant to each presentation by reference to its whole fish equivalent. The presentations and the corresponding weight conversion rates and minimum price levels were published in the Annex to the Commission notice announcing the initiation of the present investigation. No comments have been received in this respect.
5. DURATION OF THE REVISED DUTIES
(18) It should be recalled that according to Article 11(2) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 18(1) of the basic countervailing Regulation, the revision of the form of the duty resulting from the present investigation does not change the normal duration of the anti-dumping and countervailing measures since the review has not covered issues of dumping and injury.
6. REPLACEMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 1890/97 AND REGULATION (EC) No 1891/97
(19) The separate anti-dumping and countervailing Regulations were adopted following the initiation of two separate investigations concerning imports of dumped and subsidised salmon(15). In order to simplify the application of the duties, it is appropriate to replace those Regulations by a single Regulation. However, the facts and considerations established in the anti-dumping and countervailing Regulations remain valid as constituting the facts and considerations of the present Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 of 30 March 1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and (EC) No 1891/97', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 17(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2), it is for the food business operator to remove tonsils after post mortem inspection.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down requirements for the production of colostrum. It should therefore be subject to official controls.
(3) Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 establishes general principles to be followed for certificates accompanying imports of products of animal origin from third countries. In particular, it requires certificates to be drawn up at least in the official language of the third country of dispatch and the Member State of entry. Due to many practical and operational problems already raised by this double requirement, it is more appropriate to limit these requirements to the basic principle of an obligation to draw up certificates at least in the official language or languages of the Member State of entry. However, due to its interest in certain situations, provision allowing the third country of dispatch to use its official language should be maintained as one possibility in supplement to the above principle. Annex VI should be amended accordingly.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 should be amended accordingly.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for yarn of poly(p-phenyleneterephthalamide) for use in the manufacture of tyres or of products used in the manufacture of tyres, falling within subheading ex 51.01 A of the Common Customs Tariff
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the draft Regulation submitted by the Commission,
Whereas the production of yarn of poly(p-phenyleneterephthalamide) is currently insufficient in the Community to meet the requirements of the user industries in the Community; whereas, consequently, Community supplies of products of this type currently depend to a considerable extent on imports from third countries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to partially suspend the Common Customs Tariff duty for the yarn in question, within the Community tariff quota, of an appropriate volume for a relatively limited period; whereas, in order not to bring into question the development prospects of this production in the Community while ensuring an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to limit the benefits of tariff quotas solely to products for use in the manufacture of tyres, to open the quota for the period 1 July to 31 December 1985 and to fix the volume of this quota at a level of 600 tonnes, corresponding to the needs for imports from third countries during that period, and to fix the quota duty at 2 %;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate of duty for the tariff quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is exhausted; whereas, in the light of these principles, arrangements for the utilization of the tariff quota based on an allocation among Member States would seem to be consistent with the Community nature of the quota; whereas, to correspond as closely as possible to the actual trend in the market in the product in question, allocation of the quota should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States as calculated by reference to statistics of imports from third countries during a representative reference period and to the economic outlook for the quota period in question;
Whereas, however, since the quota is an autonomous Community tariff quota intended to cover import needs arising in the Community, for experimental purposes, the quota volume may be allocated on the basis of the temporary import needs from third countries expressed by each of the Member States; whereas these arrangements for allocation will equally ensure the uniform application of the Common Customs Tariff;
Whereas, to take account of possible import trends for the product concerned, the quota volume should be divided into two tranches, the first being allocated between certain Member States and the second held as a reserve to meet subsequent requirements of Member States which have used up their initial shares and any additional requirements which might arise in the other Member States; whereas, to give importers of the Member States some degree of certainty, the first tranche of the tariff quota should be fixed at a relatively high level, which in this case could be 560 tonnes;
Whereas initial shares may be used up at different rates; whereas, to avoid disruption of supplies on this account, it should be provided that any Member State which has almost used up its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas each time its additional share is almost used up a Member State should draw a further share, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares should be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, which latter must be in a position to keep account of the extent to which the quotas have been used up and to inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of a Member State's initial share remains unused, it is essential that the Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, in order to prevent a part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State while it could be used in others; Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1249/85 of 13 May 1985 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for yarn of poly(p-phenyleneterephthalamide) for use in the manufacture of tyres or of products used in the manufacture of tyres, falling within subheading ex 51.01 A of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Directive 77/504/EEC of 25 July 1977 on pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species (1), as last amended by Regulation EEC No 3768/85 (2) and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Directive 77/504/EEC was intended gradually to liberalize intra-Community trade in pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species; whereas, for this purpose, additional harmonization with regard to the acceptance of such animals and their semen for breeding purposes is necessary ;
Whereas, in this respect, it is necessary to prevent national provisions relating to the acceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species and their semen from constituting a prohibition, restriction or impediment to intra-Community trade either in the case of natural service or artificial insemination ;
Whereas there must be no prohibition, restriction or impediment on pure-bred female animals of the bovine species for breeding purposes ;
Whereas artificial insemination constitutes an important technique for increasing the use of the best breeders and, hence, for improving the bovine species; whereas in so doing, however, any impairment of the pedigree must be avoided, particularly with regard to male breeders, which must possess all guarantees of their genetic value and of their freedom from hereditary defects ;
Whereas it is necessary to make a distinction between the acceptance for artificial insemination of pure-bred bulls and their semen which have undergone all the official tests laid down for their breed in a Member State and the acceptance of bulls and their semen accepted solely for the purposes of testing ;
Whereas it is useful to establish a procedure for solving, in particular, difficulties that may arise in the assessment of the results of tests ;
Whereas the provision that semen must come from officially approved centres responsible for artificial insemination is capable of providing the guarantees necessary for attaining the desired end ;
Whereas it is desirable that pure-bred bulls and their semen be identified by blood grouping or any other appropriate methods ;
Whereas it is useful to provide for the designation of certain bodies for collaborating in the harmonization of testing methods and of the assessment of results ;
Whereas in the light of particular conditions currently existing in Spain and Portugal it is necessary to provide for an additional prolongation for the implementation of this Directive,","{'title': 'Council Directive 87/328/EEC of 18 June 1987 on the acceptance for breeding purposes of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMember States shall ensure that, without prejudice to animal health rules, there is no prohibition, restriction or impediment on the acceptance of pure-bred female animals of the bovine species for breeding purposes and the acceptance of pure-bred bulls for natural service.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the unit amount of the production aid must be reduced where the actual production for a given marketing year exceeds the maximum guaranteed quantity fixed for that marketing year; whereas,  however, producers whose average production is less than 500 kilograms of olive oil per marketing year are not affected by that reduction;
Whereas Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that, in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil which may be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be established;  whereas, for the 1991/92 marketing year, the estimated production and the unit amount of the production aid which may be paid in advance were fixed by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1090/93 (5);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 17a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84, not more than six months after the end of the marketing year the quantity actually produced in respect of which entitlement to the aid has been recognized must be determined; whereas,  to that end, in accordance with Article 12a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3061/84 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2796/93 (7), the Member States concerned must notify the Commission, not later than 31 March following each marketing year,  of the quantity recognized as qualifying for the aid in each Member State; whereas as a result of those communications the quantity eligible for aid for the 1992/93 marketing year amounts to 410 000 tonnes for Italy, 1 840 tonnes for France, 314 432  tonnes for Greece, 636 000 tonnes for Spain and 17 075 tonnes for Portugal; whereas, as a consequence, the sum of the quantities thus forwarded constitutes the quantity eligible for reimbursement from the EAGGF;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns a new use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) (Safizym X), as a feed additive for ducks, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) was authorised without a time limit for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1453/2004 (2), without a time limit for turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005 (3), without a time limit for laying hens by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/2005 (4) and for ten years for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 497/2007 (5).
(5) New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation for ducks. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 July 2007 that the preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8 produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CNCM MA 6-10) (Safizym X) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (6). It further concluded that that preparation does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation for this additional animal category. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation is efficacious in digestibility of feedingstuffs. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ‘cereal products’, namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ‘other cereals’, these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) The current situation on the cereals market and, in particular, the supply prospects mean that the export refunds should be abolished.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Directive 2009/82/EC (2) tetraconazole was included as active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/CEE for use as a fungicide.
(2) However, the inclusion of tetraconazole is limited to uses on field crops with a restricted rate and timing of application. Uses on apples and grapes are entirely excluded. Those restrictions were necessary because at the time of inclusion the information required for the groundwater assessment was insufficient, in particular as regards the risk of contamination by two metabolites which had not been identified by the notifier. As regards uses on apples and grapes, the information necessary for the assessment of the risk to consumers was incomplete.
(3) The notifier Isagro has requested an amendment to the inclusion of tetraconazole extending its use as a fungicide by removing those restrictions. It has submitted further scientific data in support of its request.
(4) Italy which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) assessed those data and submitted to the Commission on 10 February 2010 an addendum to the draft assessment report on tetraconazole, which was circulated for comments to the other Member States and to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The draft assessment report together with that addendum was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 October 2010 in the format of the Commission review report for tetraconazole.
(5) The new data submitted by the notifier and the new assessment carried out by the rapporteur Member State indicate that the requested extension of use does not cause any risks in addition to those already taken into account in the specific provisions for tetraconazole in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC and in the Commission review report for that substance. In particular as regards the risk of groundwater contamination, the rapporteur Member State considered that the new study submitted by the notifier identifies those metabolites and that there is no unacceptable leaching. Concerning use on apples and grapes, it concluded that, as completed by the new supervised and field trials, the residue data show that there are no risks as regards the acute and chronic intake by consumers.
(6) In accordance with Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, it is therefore justified to modify the specific provisions for tetraconazole by removing the restrictions on its use as a fungicide.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

MORO\n\nANNEX\n\nCHAPTER I SPECIFICATIONS FOR METERS FOR LIQUIDS OTHER THAN WATER\n\n1. Definitions      1.1. ""Minimum delivery"" means the smallest volume of liquid which may be measured by a particular pattern.\n\n1.2. ""Cyclic volume"" means the volume of liquid corresponding to the operating cycle of the measuring device, that is to say to the whole of the movements at the end of which all the internal moving parts of the measuring device return, for the first time, to their original position.\n\n1.3. ""Periodic variation"" means the maximum difference, during one working cycle, between the volume displaced by the moving components and the corresponding volume shown by the indicator, the latter being connected to the measuring device without play or slip and in such a way that it indicates at the end of the cycle and for this cycle a volume equal to the cyclic volume. This difference may be reduced by a suitable calibration device.\n\n2. Indicating mechanisms      2.1. Meters must incorporate an indicating mechanism showing the measured volume in cubic centimetres or millilitres, in cubic decimetres or litres or in cubic metres.\n\n2.2. In an indicating mechanism having one or more elements, that which is marked with the smallest scale intervals is called the ""first element"".\n\n2.3. The drive between the indicating mechanism and the measuring device must be reliable, durable and effected by means of a mechanical connection or by a permanent magnet device.\n\n2.4.1. Reading of the indications must be reliable, easy and unambiguous.\n\n2.4.2. If the indicating mechanism incorporates several elements, the indicating mechanism as a whole must he so constructed that the reading of the indication can be performed by simple juxtaposition of the indications of the different elements.\n\n2.5. The maximum capacity of the indicating mechanism must be of the form 1 × 10n, 2 × 10n or 5 × 10n authorised units of volume, n being a whole positive or negative number, or zero.\n\n2.6. The movement of an element may be either continuous or discontinuous.\n\n2.7. When the moving part of an element has a continuous movement, a graduated scale and a datum mark must enable the measured quantity to be determined for every position at which the element might come to rest.\n\n2.8. Scale intervals on the first element must be in the form 1 × 10n, 2 × 10n or 5 × 10n authorised units of volume.\n\n2.9. Except for the element which corresponds to the maximum capacity of the indicating mechanism, the value of one revolution of an element must be of the form 10n authorised units, when the graduated scale on this unit is completely visible.\n\n2.10. When an element consists of a fixed circular scale and a rotating pointer, the direction of rotation of this pointer must be clockwise.\n\n2.11. On an indicating mechanism having several elements, each rotation of the moving part of the elements of which the graduation is entirely visible must correspond to the value of the scale interval of the next element.\n\n2.12. On an indicating mechanism having several elements, the indication of an element with a discontinuous movement, other than the first element, must move forward by one figure while the preceeding element moves through not more than one-tenth of its revolution. This forward movement must cease when the preceding element indicates zero.\n\n2.13. When an indicating mechanism has several elements and when only a pan of the scale of the second and subsequent elements is visible in the windows, the movement of the latter elements must be discontinuous. The movement of the first element may be continuous or discontinuous.\n\n2.14. If the indication is given by figures in-line and if the movement of the first element is discontinuous, the marking of one or more fixed zeros to the right of this element is permissible.\n\n2.15. When the first element has only a portion of its scale visible in a window and has a continuous movement, there can be a resulting ambiguity in the reading which should be eliminated so far as is possible. To this end, and in order to allow for reading by interpolation, the relevant window must have, parallel to the movement of the scale, a dimension not less than 1 75 times the distance between the centre lines of two consecutively numbered graduation marks, in such a way that at least two graduation marks of which one will have a figure, are always visible. The window may be assymmetrical relative to the datum mark.\n\n2.16. On scales having graduation marks, the marks must have the same thickness, constant along the length of the mark, which shall not exceed one quarter of the distance between the centre lines of two consecutive marks.\n\nMarks corresponding to 1 × 10n, 2 × 10n or 5 × 10n authorised units shall only be distinguished by difference in their lengths.\n\n2.17. The actual or apparent distance between the axes of two consecutive graduation marks must not be less than 2 millimetres.\n\n2.18. The actual or apparent height of the figures must not be less than 4 millimetres.\n\n3. Calibrating devices      3.1. Meters must incorporate a calibrating device which can vary the relationship between the indicated and actual volumes of liquid passing through the meter.\n\n3.2. When this device changes this relationship in a discontinuous manner, the consecutive increments of this relationship must never differ by more than 0 7002.\n\n3.3. Regulation by means of a bypass arrangement on the meter is prohibited.\n\n4. Special conditions concerning the minimum delivery      4.1. The minimum delivery must be such that each of the following values shall be not greater than the maximum permissible error for such delivery as specified in items 2 and 3 of Chapter II:        1. the volume corresponding to a movement of 2 millimeters of the scale of the first element of the indicating mechanism and to one-fifth of the value of the scale interval, when the first element has a continuous movement;\n\n2. the volume corresponding to two consecutive movements of the figures when the first element has a discontinuous movement;\n\n3. the error which, under normal operation conditions, is caused by play or slip in the drive between the measuring device and the first element of the indicating mechanism;\n\n4. twice the periodic variation.\n\n4.2. In the determination of this minimum delivery, account must also be taken, where necessary, of the effect of the additional components on the measuring equipment, in accordance with the requirements stated in the directive concerning this equipment.\n\n4.3. The minimum delivery must be in the form 1 × 10n, 2 × 10n or 5 × 10n authorised units, n being a whole positive or negative number, or zero.\n\n5. Maximum and minimum rates of flow      5.1. The maximum and minimum rates of flow are specified in the certificate of approval in accordance with results obtained during the examination. The meter must be capable of operation for a determined period specified in the certificate of approval, at approximately its maximum rate of flow without showing any noticeable change in its measuring qualities.\n\n5.2. The ratio between the maximum and minimum rates of flow must be at least equal to 10 for meters in general and to 5 for meters for liquefied gases.\n\n6. Effect of the nature of the liquid, of temperature and of pressure      6.1. The certificate of approval of a meter must specify the liquid or liquids for which the meter is intended, the temperature limits for the liquid to be measured where these limits are below -10 ºC or above + 50 ºC, as well as the maximum working pressure.\n\n6.2. The examination carried out for the purpose of approving a model of a meter must show that the variations in error due to maximum variations in the properties of the liquids, to the pressure and the temperature of the liquid, within the limits which are to be specified in the certificate of approval, must not exceed, for each of these factors, one half of the values stated in items 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter II.\n\n7. Maximum permissible errors on a meter alone      7.1. When the initial verification of a measuring system is preceded by metrological examination of the meter alone, within the meaning of Article 3, the maximum permissible errors at the time of this examination are equal to one half of the maximum permissible errors specified in items 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter II but not less than 0 73 % of the measured quantity, if the liquid used is the same as that for which the meter is intended.\n\n7.2. However, if the precision of measurement is not sufficient to permit the application of this requirement, the certificate of approval may increase the maximum permissible errors, within the limits of those specified in items 1, 2 and 3 of Chapter II.\n\n7.3. Moreover, the certificate of approval may reduce and/or vary the maximum permissible errors where the verification referred to above will be carried out either with only one of the liquids provided for or with a different liquid.\n\nIn the latter case (that is to say when the liquid used in the verification is different from that for which the meter is intended), the certificate of approval may specify the rates of flow during testing at rates other than those which lie between the maximum and minimum rates of flow.\n\n8. Legends      8.1. Each meter must carry, in a legible and indelible manner, either on the dial of the indicating mechanism or on a special plate, the following information:        (a) the EEC pattern approval symbol\n\n(b) the identification mark or name of the manufacturer\n\n(c) the manufacturer\'s description, if any\n\n(d) serial number of meter and the year of manufacture\n\n(e) the cyclic volume\n\n(f) the maximum and minimum rates of flow\n\n(g) the maximum working pressure\n\n(h) the temperature range in the case where the liquid can be measured at a temperature below -10 ºC or above + 50 ºC\n\n(i) the nature of the liquid or liquids to be measured and the limits of viscosity, kinematic or dynamic, where an indication of the nature of the liquid alone is not sufficient to determine their viscosity.\n\n8.2. The following items must be visibly marked on the dial of the indicating mechanism:        (a) the unit in which the measured volumes are expressed or the symbol for this unit,\n\n(b) the minimum delivery.\n\n8.3. Where there is a possibility of ambiguity the direction of movement of the liquid must be indicated by an arrow on the meter casing.\n\n8.4. On meters which measure potable liquids and which can be dismantled, the serial number or the three last figures of this number must be repeated on parts whose replacement can affect the measurement results.\n\n8.5. The indicating mechanism may carry a special description and identifying number.\n\n9. Placing of seals and verification marks      9.1. Sealing devices must prevent access to parts which can alter the calibration and, the dismantling, even partially, of the meter where such dismantling is not authorised in the certificate of approval (meters which measure potable liquids and which can be dismantled).\n\n9.2. A firm location on an essential part, visible without dismantling, must be provided on the measuring device, on the indicating mechanism or on their housing for the application of the EEC verification mark.\n\n9.3. The certificate of approval may require a location for the application of a stamp on interchangeable components of meters which can be dismantled, alongside the serial number referred to in item 8.4 in this Chapter.\n\nCHAPTER II MAXIMUM PERMISSIBLE ERRORS ON MEASURING SYSTEMS\n\n1. When a meter is incorporated in a measuring system, the maximum permissible errors, in excess or in deficiency, at the initial verification of this system, under the normal working conditions and within the working limits specified in the certificate of approval, are laid down by the following table, in terms of the measured quantities : >PIC FILE= ""T0011029"">\n\n2. However, the maximum permissible error on the maximum delivery is double the value laid down in item 1 of Chapter II and, whatever might be the measured quantity, the maximum permissible error is never less than that permitted on the minimum delivery.\n\n3. Because of difficulties inherent in the testing facilities, the maximum permissible errors are double those given in items 1 and 2 of Chapter II where these are applicable to measuring equipment for liquid gases or other liquids measured at a temperature below -10 ºC or above +50 ºC, as well as for equipment for which the minimum rate of flow is not greater than 1 litre per hour.\n\n4. If, on initial verification, the errors are all of the same sense, one at least amongst them must not exceed the limits laid down in item 7.1 of Chapter I.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 established quantitative restrictions on imports of certain textile products originating in certain third countries to be allocated on a first come, first served basis.
(2) Under that Regulation it is possible, in certain circumstances, to use other allocation methods, to divide quotas into tranches, or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance.
(3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2014 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly.
(4) The measures adopted in previous years, such as those in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1163/2012 (2), proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2014.
(5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ‘first come, first served’ allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method.
(6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration, operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2014 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2013.
(7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities, an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount, provided that quantities are available in the quotas.
(8) To secure a sound administration, import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should, however, be authorised, in response to importers’ applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2015 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.

Having regard to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (1), and in particular Article 22 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2006/88/EC lays down the animal health requirements to be applied for the placing on the market, the importation into and the transit through the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof. That Directive provides that aquaculture animals and products thereof are to be introduced into the Community only from third countries or parts of third countries that appear on a list drawn up and updated in accordance with the procedure referred to therein.
(2) Article 11 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 of 12 December 2008 implementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards conditions and certification requirements for the placing on the market and the import into the Community of aquaculture animals and products thereof and laying down a list of vector species (2) lays down the rules applicable to the import of ornamental aquatic animals intended for closed ornamental facilities.
(3) Pursuant to Article 11(2) of that Regulation, Member States are to authorise the imports of ornamental fish which are not of susceptible species to any of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, and ornamental mollusc and ornamental crustaceans intended for closed ornamental facilities only from third countries or territories that are members of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). That provision ensures that relevant epidemiological data related to those animals is made available to all OIE members.
(4) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 lays down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which imports are permitted of aquaculture animals intended for farming, put and take fisheries and open ornamental facilities, and of ornamental fish susceptible to one or more of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC and intended for closed ornamental facilities.
(5) The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) is an international organisation that provides technical assistance, policy advice, training and research services to 22 Pacific Island countries and territories in areas such as health, human development, agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Certain SPC members are not members of the OIE.
(6) The OIE and the SPC concluded an Agreement in September 1999. Pursuant to that Agreement, the SPC is to encourage those of its members that are not members of the OIE to participate in the OIE information network for animal health and aquatic animal health.
(7) The Annex to that Agreement, concluded by the SPC and the OIE on 10 April 2003, lays down the terms of collaboration between both parties for the development, maintenance and distribution of a Regional Animal Health Information System for the Pacific Island Countries and its Territories.
(8) By letters of 31 March 2009 and 30 April 2009, the SPC informed the Commission that SPC members that are not members of the OIE are able to upload relevant disease information in the OIE World Animal Health Information System in accordance with OIE criteria, as from May 2009.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Article 11(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, in order to authorise imports of ornamental fish which are not of susceptible species to any of the diseases listed in Part II of Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, and ornamental molluscs and ornamental crustaceans, intended for closed ornamental facilities also from third countries and territories that are not members of the OIE but have an official agreement with that organisation in order to participate in its information network for animal health and aquatic animal health.
(10) The United States have confirmed that Puerto Rico, US Virgin Island, American Samoa, Guam and Northern Mariana Islands are considered territories of the United States and the competent authority of the United States is responsible for notification of animal diseases to the OIE.
(11) Annex III to that Regulation should also be amended accordingly, to include the relevant SPC members.
(12) Pursuant to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products (3), Member States were to ensure that imports of aquaculture animals and products from third countries were subject to conditions at least equivalent to those applying to the production and placing on the market of Community products.
(13) While Directive 91/67/EEC was in force, imports from the United States of crustaceans for farming, put and take fisheries, and open ornamental facilities were permitted in the Member States. That Directive was repealed and replaced by Directive 2006/88/EC, which harmonised the animal health requirements for such imports.
(14) Article 20(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 lays down a transitional period during which consignments of crustaceans for farming, put and take fisheries, and open ornamental facilities may continue to be imported in accordance with the regime in place before the entry into force of Directive 2006/88/EC. That transitional period expires on 30 June 2009.
(15) Therefore, the United States should be included in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008, pending the completion of on-the-spot inspections carried out in accordance with Directive 2006/88/EC in order to verify conformity with Community aquatic animal health rules.
(16) Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1251/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(1) By virtue of Regulation (EC) No 2505/96(1), the Council opened Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural and industrial products. Community demand for the products in question should be met under the most favourable conditions. Community tariff quotas should therefore be opened at reduced or zero rates of duty for appropriate volumes, and increased or extended in the case of certain existing tariff quotas, while avoiding any disturbance to the markets for these products.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2505/96 should therefore be amended.

Where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a vessel on the high seas has been engaged in unauthorised fishing within an area under the jurisdiction of a coastal State, the flag State of that vessel, at the request of the coastal State concerned, shall immediately and fully investigate the matter. The flag State shall cooperate with the coastal State in taking appropriate enforcement action in such cases and may authorise the relevant authorities of the coastal State to board and inspect the vessel on the high seas. This paragraph is without prejudice to Article 111 of the Convention.\n\n7. States Parties which are members of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or participants in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement may take action in accordance with international law, including through recourse to subregional or regional procedures established for this purpose, to deter vessels which have engaged in activities which undermine the effectiveness of or otherwise violate the conservation and management measures established by that organisation or arrangement from fishing on the high seas in the subregion or region until such time as appropriate action is taken by the flag State.'}, {'id': '21', 'title': 'Article 21', 'text': 'Article 21\n\nSubregional and regional cooperation in enforcement\n\n1. In any high seas area covered by a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, a State Party which is a member of such organisation or a participant in such arrangement may, through its duly authorised inspectors, board and inspect, in accordance with paragraph 2, fishing vessels flying the flag of another State Party to this Agreement, whether or not such State Party is also a member of the organisation or a participant in the arrangement, for the purpose of ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks established by that organisation or arrangement.\n\n2. States shall establish, through subregional or regional fisheries management organisations or arrangements, procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as procedures to implement other provisions of this Article. Such procedures shall be consistent with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22 and shall not discriminate against non-members of the organisation or non-participants in the arrangement. Boarding and inspection as well as any subsequent enforcement action shall be conducted in accordance with such procedures. States shall give due publicity to procedures established pursuant to this paragraph.\n\n3. If, within two years of the adoption of this Agreement, any organisation or arrangement has not established such procedures, boarding and inspection pursuant to paragraph 1, as well as any subsequent enforcement action, shall, pending the establishment of such procedures, be conducted in accordance with this Article and the basic procedures set out in Article 22.\n\n4. Prior to taking action under this Article, inspecting States shall, either directly or through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, inform all States whose vessels fish on the high seas in the subregion or region of the form of identification issued to their duly authorised inspectors. The vessels used for boarding and inspection shall be clearly marked and identifiable as being on government service. At the time of becoming a Party to this Agreement, a State shall designate an appropriate authority to receive notifications pursuant to this Article and shall give due publicity of such designation through the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement.\n\n5. Where, following a boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has engaged in any activity contrary to the conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1, the inspecting State shall, where appropriate, secure evidence and shall promptly notify the flag State of the alleged violation.\n\n6. The flag State shall respond to the notification referred to in paragraph 5 within three working days of its receipt, or such other period as may be prescribed in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2, and shall either:\n\n(a) fulfil, without delay, its obligations under Article 19 to investigate and, if evidence so warrants, take enforcement action with respect to the vessel, in which case it shall promptly inform the inspecting State of the results of the investigation and of any enforcement action taken; or\n\n(b) authorise the inspecting State to investigate.\n\n7. Where the flag State authorises the inspecting State to investigate an alleged violation, the inspecting State shall, without delay, communicate the results of that investigation to the flag State. The flag State shall, if evidence so warrants, fulfil its obligations to take enforcement action with respect to the vessel. Alternatively, the flag State may authorise the inspecting State to take such enforcement action as the flag State may specify with respect to the vessel, consistent with the rights and obligations of the flag State under this Agreement.\n\n8. Where, following boarding and inspection, there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a serious violation, and the flag State has either failed to respond or failed to take action as required under paragraphs 6 or 7, the inspectors may remain on board and secure evidence and may require the master to assist in further investigation including, where appropriate, by bringing the vessel without delay to the nearest appropriate port, or to such other port as may be specified in procedures established in accordance with paragraph 2. The inspecting State shall immediately inform the flag State of the name of the port to which the vessel is to proceed. The inspecting State and the flag State and, as appropriate, the port State shall take all necessary steps to ensure the well-being of the crew regardless of their nationality.\n\n9. The inspecting State shall inform the flag State and the relevant organisation or the participants in the relevant arrangement of the results of any further investigation.\n\n10. The inspecting State shall require its inspectors to observe generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to the safety of the vessel and the crew, minimise interference with fishing operations and, to the extent practicable, avoid action which would adversely affect the quality of the catch on board. The inspecting State shall ensure that boarding and inspection is not conducted in a manner that would constitute harassment of any fishing vessel.\n\n11. For the purposes of this Article, a serious violation means:\n\n(a) fishing without a valid licence, authorisation or permit issued by the flag State in accordance with Article 18(3)(a);\n\n(b) failing to maintain accurate records of catch and catch-related data, as required by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement, or serious misreporting of catch, contrary to the catch reporting requirements of such organisation or arrangement;\n\n(c) fishing in a closed area, fishing during a closed season or fishing without, or after attainment of, a quota established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement;\n\n(d) directed fishing for a stock which is subject to a moratorium or for which fishing is prohibited;\n\n(e) using prohibited fishing gear;\n\n(f) falsifying or concealing the markings, identity or registration of a fishing vessel;\n\n(g) concealing, tampering with or disposing of evidence relating to an investigation;\n\n(h) multiple violations which together constitute a serious disregard of conservation and management measures; or\n\n(i) such other violations as may be specified in procedures established by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement.\n\n12. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, the flag State may, at any time, take action to fulfil its obligations under Article 19 with respect to an alleged violation. Where the vessel is under the direction of the inspecting State, the inspecting State shall, at the request of the flag State, release the vessel to the flag State along with full information on the progress and outcome of its investigation.\n\n13. This Article is without prejudice to the right of the flag State to take any measures, including proceedings to impose penalties, according to its laws.\n\n14. This Article applies mutatis mutandis to boarding and inspection by a State Party which is a member of a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or a participant in a subregional or regional fisheries management arrangement and which has clear grounds for believing that a fishing vessel flying the flag of another State Party has engaged in any activity contrary to relevant conservation and management measures referred to in paragraph 1 in the high seas area covered by such organisation or arrangement, and such vessel has subsequently, during the same fishing trip, entered into an area under the national jurisdiction of the inspecting State.\n\n15. Where a subregional or regional fisheries management organisation or arrangement has established an alternative mechanism which effectively discharges the obligation under this Agreement of its members or participants to ensure compliance with the conservation and management measures established by the organisation or arrangement, members of such organisation or participants in such arrangement may agree to limit the application of paragraph 1 as between themselves in respect of the conservation and management measures which have been established in the relevant high seas area.\n\n16. Action taken by States other than the flag State in respect of vessels having engaged in activities contrary to subregional or regional conservation and management measures shall be proportionate to the seriousness of the violation.\n\n17. Where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a fishing vessel on the high seas is without nationality, a State may board and inspect the vessel. Where evidence so warrants, the State may take such action as may be appropriate in accordance with international law.\n\n18. States shall be liable for damage or loss attributable to them arising from action taken pursuant to this Article when such action is unlawful or exceeds that reasonably required in the light of available information to implement the provisions of this Article.'}, {'id': '22', 'title': 'Article 22', 'text': ""Article 22\n\nBasic procedures for boarding and inspection pursuant to Article 21\n\n1.

The degree of force used shall not exceed that reasonably required in the circumstances.\n\n2. The duly authorised inspectors of an inspecting State shall have the authority to inspect the vessel, its licence, gear, equipment, records, facilities, fish and fish products and any relevant documents necessary to verify compliance with the relevant conservation and management measures.\n\n3. The flag State shall ensure that vessel masters:\n\n(a) accept and facilitate prompt and safe boarding by the inspectors;\n\n(b) cooperate with and assist in the inspection of the vessel conducted pursuant to these procedures;\n\n(c) do not obstruct, intimidate or interfere with the inspectors in the performance of their duties;\n\n(d) allow the inspectors to communicate with the authorities of the flag State and the inspecting State during the boarding and inspection;\n\n(e) provide reasonable facilities, including, where appropriate, food and accommodation, to the inspectors;\n\n(f) facilitate safe disembarkation by the inspectors.\n\n4. In the event that the master of a vessel refuses to accept boarding and inspection in accordance with this Article and Article 21, the flag State shall, except in circumstances where, in accordance with generally accepted international regulations, procedures and practices relating to safety at sea, it is necessary to delay the boarding and inspection, direct the master of the vessel to submit immediately to boarding and inspection and, if the master does not comply with such direction, shall suspend the vessel's authorisation to fish and order the vessel to return immediately to port.

A precautionary reference point is an estimated value derived through an agreed scientific procedure, which corresponds to the state of the resource and of the fishery, and which can be used as a guide for fisheries management.\n\n2. Two types of precautionary reference points should be used: conservation, or limit, reference points and management, or target, reference points. Limit reference points set boundaries which are intended to constrain harvesting within safe biological limits within which the stocks can produce maximum sustainable yield. Target reference points are intended to meet management objectives.\n\n3. Precautionary reference points should be stock-specific to account, inter alia, for the reproductive capacity, the resilience of each stock and the characteristics of fisheries exploiting the stock, as well as other sources of mortality and major sources of uncertainty.\n\n4. Management strategies shall seek to maintain or restore populations of harvested stocks, and where necessary associated or dependent species, at levels consistent with previously agreed precautionary reference points. Such reference points shall be used to trigger pre-agreed conservation and management action. Management strategies shall include measures which can be implemented when precautionary reference points are approached.\n\n5. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that the risk of exceeding limit reference points is very low. If a stock falls below a limit reference point or is at risk of falling below such a reference point, conservation and management action should be initiated to facilitate stock recovery. Fishery management strategies shall ensure that target reference points are not exceeded on average.\n\n6. When information for determining reference points for a fishery is poor or absent, provisional reference points shall be set. Provisional reference points may be established by analogy to similar and better-known stocks. In such situations, the fishery shall be subject to enhanced monitoring so as to enable revision of provisional reference points as improved information becomes available.\n\n7. The fishing mortality rate which generates maximum sustainable yield should be regarded as a minimum standard for limit reference points. For stocks which are not overfished, fishery management strategies shall ensure that fishing mortality does not exceed that which corresponds to maximum sustainable yield, and that the biomass does not fall below a predefined threshold. For overfished stocks, the biomass which would produce maximum sustainable yield can serve as a rebuilding target.'}]}"

Whereas the average world market price must be determined on the most favourable purchasing terms available on that market;
Whereas relevant figures should be those recorded during the marketing period for Community seeds for offers on the world market and prices quoted on the major international exchanges ; whereas, however, those offers which cannot be considered representative of the true trend of the market should be ignored;
Whereas, if there are no representative offers or quotations for linseed, the average world market price for linseed should be determined on the value of the products resulting from the processing of this seed ; whereas where the offers or quotations for linseed on the world market would prejudice the sale of the Community production of linseed the world market price should be determined on the value of the average quantities of oil and oil-cake derived from the processing of linseed less the processing costs;
Whereas, to ensure the smooth running of the subsidy system, the average world market price must be recorded for a Community frontier crossing point ; whereas in fixing this point account should be taken of the extent to which it is representative for imports of linseed and therefore the port of Rotterdam should be chosen ; whereas offers and quotations will have to be adjusted if they relate to a different frontier crossing point;

Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) That list may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2).
(3) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) An application for authorisation of the use of polyglycitol syrup in several food categories was submitted and was made available to the Member States.
(5) The European Food Safety Authority evaluated the safety of polyglycitol syrup when used as a food additive (3). It considers that the chemical and toxicological data available for polyglycitol syrup are insufficient to establish an acceptable daily intake. However, it concludes, on the basis of the available data, that there are no indications of a safety concern for the proposed uses and use levels.
(6) There is a technological need for the use of polyglycitol syrup as an alternative polyol for the other already authorised polyols. Polyglycitol syrup is less sweet and provides more bulk, opacity, binding and stability in energy-reduced or sugar-free products. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories applied for and to assign E 964 as E-number to that food additive.
(7) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives (4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories concerned before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to that food additive.
(8) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.

Polyglycitol syrup is less sweet and provides more bulk, opacity, binding and stability in energy-reduced or sugar-free products. It is therefore appropriate to authorise the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories applied for and to assign E 964 as E-number to that food additive.\n\n((7)) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives(4), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of polyglycitol syrup in the food categories concerned before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to that food additive.\n\n((8)) Therefore, Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 should be amended accordingly.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nin point 2 of Part B the following entry for E 964 is inserted after the entry for E 962:\n‘E 964\nPolyglycitol syrup’\n(2)\nin Part E the following entries for E 964 are inserted in numerical order in the relevant food categories:\n‘\n03.\nEdible ices\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n200\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n04.2.5.1\nExtra jam and extra jelly as defined by Directive 2001/113/EC\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n500\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n04.2.5.2\nJam, jellies and marmalades and sweetened chestnut puree as defined by Directive 2001/113/EC\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n500\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n04.2.5.3\nOther similar fruit or vegetable spreads\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n500\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n05.1\nCocoa and Chocolate products as covered by Directive 2000/36/EC\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n200\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n05.2\nOther confectionery including breath refreshening microsweets\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n200\xa0000\nonly cocoa based energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n600\xa0000\nonly starch based confectionery energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n800\xa0000\nonly chewy candy with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n990\xa0000\nonly hard candy with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n05.3\nChewing gum\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n200\xa0000\nOnly with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n06.3\nBreakfast cereals\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n200\xa0000\nonly breakfast cereals or cereal-based products, energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n07.2\nFine bakery wares\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n300\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012\n16.\nDesserts excluding products covered in category 1, 3 and 4\nE 964\nPolyglycitol syrup\n300\xa0000\nonly energy-reduced or with no added sugar\nPeriod of application:\nFrom 29 November 2012’'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/220/EEC of 23 April 1990 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 94/15/EC (2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with Articles 10 to 18 of Directive 90/220/EEC, there is a Community procedure enabling the competent authority of a Member State to give consent to the placing on the market of live products consisting of genetically modified organisms;
Whereas, a notification concerning the placing on the market of such a product (a hybrid herbicide-tolerant swede-rape marketed as seed) has been submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom for the purpose of growing for obtaining seed but not for marketing for human food or animal feed;
Whereas, the competent authorities of the United Kingdom has subsequently forwarded the dossier thereon to the Commission with a favourable opinion;
Whereas the Commission has forwarded the dossier to the competent authorities of all Member States; whereas the competent authorities of other Member States have raised objections to the said dossier;
Whereas the objections raised concern:
- the assessment of the product's effects on the pattern of use of chemical herbicides and the uncertainty concerning any resulting long-term environmental consequences,
- the assessment of the health (toxicological) effects of the product if its is to be used for human food or animal feed, and
- the labelling of the product;
Whereas, therefore, in accordance with Article 13 (3), the Commission is required to take a decision in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21 of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas the authorization for use in the environment of chemical herbicides is subject to other Community legislation, and in particular Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (3), as last amended by Directive 94/43/EC (4); whereas, therefore, issues related to the authorization of the herbicide are not within the scope of Directive 90/220/EEC;
Whereas in the notification made under Directive 90/220/EEC the risk to human health and the environment from the survival and spread of this herbicide-tolerant swede-rape was evaluated, as well as the transfer of the herbicide tolerance gene or the other modified genes to compatible species; whereas it was concluded that the risk of establishment was low and that any spread or transfer of the herbicide tolerance gene could be controlled by using existing management strategies;
Whereas, the Commission, having examined the dossier submitted under Directive 90/220/EEC, and having taken into account all the information submitted by the Member States, has found that the information on the environmental risk contained in the dossier is sufficient to enable the Commission to take a favourable decision on the placing on the market of the said product as seed, provided that the specified conditions of use and labelling are followed;
Whereas, Article 11 (6) and Article 16 (1) of Directive 90/220/EEC provide additional safeguards if new information on risks of the product becomes available;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3944/90 (2), and in particular Article 4  thereof,
Whereas, on 30 April 1991, the Government of Greece forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet for the period 1992 to 1996, hereinafter referred to as 'the programme', as required by Article 3 (3) of Regulation  (EEC) No 4028/86; whereas it forwarded at a later date additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether, having regard to the foreseeable trend in fishery resources, the market for fishery and aquaculture products, the measures adopted under the common fisheries policy and the guidelines for the latter, the  programme fulfils the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas the objectives of the previous programme approved by Commission Decision 88/148/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 90/106/EEC (4), constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the effort still needed to ensure  that the Community objectives are achieved;
Whereas the objectives of the guidance programme for 1991 have not been uniformly achieved; whereas the current or likely situation as regards availability of fish in conjunction with the activities of the fleet concerned does not allow for any  adjustment of the forecast on the basis of which these objectives were determined and approved; whereas the efforts made to adapt the fleet should therefore be sustained and strengthened over the period 1992 to 1996, in view of the fact that  availability of fish continues to deteriorate;
Whereas the scope of the planned modernization efforts implies a substantial improvement in the overall performance of the fleet concerned which should be taken into account when assessing the relationship to be achieved by the end of the programme  period between fleet capacity and fish availability;
Whereas the development recorded should be monitored on a regular basis so as to improve or adjust the fishery support measures that accompany the implementation of the programme;
Whereas any development that does not comply with the programme objectives would run counter to the objectives of the common fisheries policy; whereas, therefore, certain specific measures undertaken under this programme may not warrant public financial  assistance; whereas, in this context, approval of the programme should only be effective where the limitations and conditions upon which such approval was made conditional are complied with;
Whereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is  most apparent; whereas there is insufficient information available at present to achieve comprehensive segmentation of the fleet in accordance with stocks and zones fished; whereas a broader range of parameters should therefore be developed to evaluate  fishing effort as well as fleet capacity;
Whereas the Commission cannot approve programmes for the full period until adequate information is available to Member States to permit this new approach and additional time will be required to execute the work programme necessary to complete this  process;
Whereas it is not appropriate to interrupt the process of reduction of the fleet inherent in the guidance programmes; whereas transitional programmes, for the period 1 January to 31 December 1992, should therefore be approved;
Whereas further reduction in fleet capacity is needed in view of the present state of the fish stocks; whereas available information indicates that a minimum reduction of 2 % expressed in tonnage and engine power, based on the objectives for the end of  1991, is necessary to compensate for technological progress; whereas in addition to that reduction, a certain percentage reduction is also necessary for catching-up, in the case of those Member States which have not reached the 1991 objectives;

GENERAL REMARKS  This programme relates to the whole of the Greek fishing fleet and covers the entire territory of Greece.\n\nII. OBJECTIVES  1. The aims of the programme are:\n\n(a) to reduce the overall level of the operational fishing fleet to 64 627 GRT and 237 658 kW, in accordance with point II.2 below;\n\n(b) to modernize the vessels of the Mediterranean fleet with a view to improving the safety of vessels at sea and the fishermen on board;\n\n(c) to redeploy fishing activities in coastal areas towards more distant and deeper waters;\n\n(d) to improve the supervision and control of fishing operations and changes in the size of the fleet;\n\n(e) to modernize existing vessels without increasing overall fishing capacity (expressed in tonnage and engine power) in the category to which the vessels concerned belong. Modernization measures must give priority to the introduction of selective  fishing gear and the improvement of facilities for the on-board preservation and treatment of catches.\n\n2. During the period covered by the programme the operational fishing fleet, with the exception of:\n\n- working vessels used solely for aquaculture,\n\n- vessels used solely for bivalve fishing,\n\nmust remain within the following limits:\n\nTonnage  (in GRT)\n\nType\n\nObjectives of\n\n1986\n\nprogramme at\n\n31. 12. 1986\n\nSituation at\n\n1. 1. 1987\n\n(¹)\n\nSituation at\n\n1. 1. 1992\n\nObjectives at\n\n31. 12. 1989\n\n31. 12. 1990\n\n31. 12. 1991\n\nObjective at\n\n31. 12. 1992\n\n1.

Global figures will consequently be adjusted.\n\n(³) Some flexibility can be allowed between these segments of the fleet.\n\nIII. PLANNED MEASURES  1.1. Whereas the objectives specified at point II.2, Total A require fishing capacity to be reduced by the difference between the situation at 1 January 1992 and the target to be achieved by 31 December 1992, account must also be  taken of changes, if any, in fishing capacity resulting from:\n\n- projects for new construction which have qualified for Community and national aid in respect of 1991,\n\n- applications for Community financing of projects for new construction currently under consideration by the Commission (¹),\n\n- vessels joining or leaving the fleet during 1992, if not covered by the first two subparagraphs,\n\nwhich, when added, give the overall fishing capacity to be reduced.\n\n1.2. The reduction referred to in point III.1.1 above must be achieved by the following measures, provided that the fishing capacities used remain within the limits laid down in the programme, although the reduction achieved by each measure may be  varied provided that the overall fishing capacity defined in III.1.1 is reduced as planned:\n\n- a reduction in the total fleet by renewal of operational vessels which have been damaged or lost at sea, in particular by the withdrawal of operational units directly linked with new vessels, in line with the guidelines and objectives laid down at  point II.2,\n\n- the adoption and implementation of measures to adjust fishing capacity, such as the granting of the final cessation premiums as compensation for any necessary reductions which cannot be achieved by the methods referred to in the first subparagraph,\n\n- other measures which enable the same results to be achieved.\n\n2. Establishment of a register of fishing vessels.\n\n3. Reduction of in-shore fishing capactiy (vessels measuring less than nine metres between perpendiculars).\n\n(¹) Overall capactiy may be adjusted to take account of the withdrawal of applications for financing currently under examination by the Commission.\n\n4. Redeployment of the coastal fleet by the withdrawal of obsolete or unsuitable vessels and by encouraging the use of more selective fishing techniques.\n\n5. Restructuring and modernization of the middle-water fleet by deploying vessels that can be used more flexibly.\n\n6. Reduction of the ocean-going fleet by encouraging the permanent withdrawal of existing vessels.\n\n7. Adoption and implementation of legislative and/or administrative measures designed to ensure effective control of fishing capacity and fishing activities with a view to achieving the objectives specified in point I.2 above.\n\nIV. COMMENTS  1. The objectives for the fleet given in the above table can be revised only on the basis of scientific evaluations leading to the establishment of the existence of resources which are not fully exploited at present.\n\n2. The objectives in tonnage and power of the programme for 1992 should be fully realized by 31 December 1992 at the latest. Reductions in fishing capacity greater than or equal to those fixed for the objectives at 31 December 1991 which were achieved  by Member States (¹) can be taken into account in 1992. In that case, the Member States may achieve a minimum of 75 % of the overall reduction for 1992 indicated in the present Annex through permanent withdrawal of vessels from fishing, while the  remaining maximum of 25 % can be attained through fishing control measures as long as they are based on permanent legal or administrative measures.\n\n3. The Commission recalls that structural financial interventions by national, regional or local authorities in favour of the sector concerned should henceforth be inserted within the framework of the present programme.\n\n(¹) On the basis of data provided by 15 February 1992 at the latest, in accordance with Article 2 of the Decision of the Commission on the multiannual guidance programme for the period 1987 to 1991.'}]}"

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1569/77 of 11 July 1977 fixing the procedure and conditions for the taking over of cereals by intervention agencies (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1841/90 (5), provides for a minimum intervention  quantity of 80 tonnes for common wheat, rye, barley, maize and grain sorghum;
Whereas, under the intervention scheme existing in Portugal up to 31 December 1990, there was no lower limit on intervention buying; whereas the Portuguese Government is attempting to promote a better organization of producers in the cereal sector;  whereas the transition from the national scheme to that resulting from the application of the common organization of the markets may create difficulties, in particular for small Portuguese producers; whereas to enable these producers to improve their  structures, provisions should be adopted permitting a gradual adjustment to Community rules;
Whereas, with regard to the minimum characteristics, the gradual transition from the measures applied in Portugal during the first stage to those provided for under the common organization of the markets should be provided for and the necessary  conversion allowed for; whereas, the immediate application of the Community scheme would risk the exclusion of large quantities from intervention; whereas, therefore, such an application would create considerable difficulties for Portuguese producers  and would, to a certain extent, go against the aims of the Act of Accession;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular points (f) and (g) of Article 43, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro (2), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 121/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) has established a scheme whereby food products may be distributed to the most deprived persons in the Union. For that purpose, products in intervention stocks may be made available or, where intervention stocks suitable for the food distribution scheme are not available, food products may be purchased on the market. For 2012 and 2013, that scheme is included in the list of measures eligible for financing by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), within an annual ceiling of EUR 500 million.
(2) In accordance with Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 the Commission has to adopt annual plans. The annual distribution plan for 2012 was adopted on 10 June 2011 by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 562/2011 (5) solely on the basis of products available in intervention stocks. The additional resources made available on the 2012 budget year for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union, as a result of the amendment of Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 by Regulation (EU) No 121/2012, should be allocated to the Member States.
(3) In order to enforce the annual budgetary ceiling, the intra-Union transfer costs, where relevant, should be included into the total financial allocation made available for each Member State to implement the 2012 distribution plan. Moreover, the deadlines fixed by Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 of 14 September 2010 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Union (6) for the requests for payment and the execution of payments by the competent authorities should be adjusted, in order to ensure that the resources allocated within the 2012 distribution plan are only eligible for Union support if those payments are made in the 2012 budget year.
(4) Taking into account the shortened time-frame left to the Member States for the implementation of the 2012 distribution plan as a consequence of the date of entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 121/2012, it is appropriate to grant an extension of the deadlines provided for in Article 3(1) and (3) of Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 as regards the implementation period of the annual plan and the completion of the payment operations for products mobilised on the market.
(5) That revision of the distribution plan for 2012 being made at a time when national administrative arrangements for the implementation of the plan should be approaching completion, the quantities of products available in intervention stocks which are reallocated following the decision of Finland to renounce to a part of its allocation of skimmed milk powder or to reassessment of the exact quantities in intervention storage should not be taken into account for calculating whether Member States have respected the obligation laid down in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) No 807/2010 to have withdrawn 70 % of cereals and skimmed milk powder by the deadlines fixed in that Article.
(6) In view of the fact that the implementation period of the 2012 distribution plan is already advanced and to allow Member States as much time as possible to proceed to the actions needed for the implementation of the amended plan, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication.
(7) Implementing Regulation (EU) No 562/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(Text with EEA relevance)
(2007/314/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (3), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 4(1) and Article 4(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Since 3 March 2007, several outbreaks of classical swine fever have occurred in Croatia close to the border with Slovenia. On 8 March 2007, Slovenia took, on the basis of the information provided by Croatia, control and precautionary measures relating to pig holdings and movements of pigs in restriction zones, located in the municipality of Brežice and within a distance of 3 and 10 kilometres from an outbreak in Croatia. Different measures apply in the 3 and in the 10 km restriction zones that have been based on the requirements laid down in Council Directive 2001/89/EC of 23 October 2001 on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever (4).
(2) In addition, on 12 March 2007 Slovenia took similar measures in zones located in the municipalities Razkrizje, Ljutomer, Ormoz and Črenšovci and within a distance of 10 kilometres from another outbreak in Croatia.
(3) The measures taken by Slovenia were notified to the Commission and the Member States without delay. Those measures include a ban on the dispatch of pigs and pig meat from the restriction zones to other parts of Slovenia and to other Member States.
(4) The control and precautionary measures taken by Slovenia have proven effective, as to date no outbreaks of classical swine fever have been detected in that Member State.
(5) Nevertheless, in order to prevent the spread of classical swine fever in the Community it is appropriate to provide for a prohibition, in this Decision, on the dispatch of pigs from holdings situated within the restriction zones established by Slovenia.
(6) However, due to the prolonged restrictive period, welfare problems are expected on pig holdings that make it necessary to allow derogations to the movement restriction.
(7) Therefore, the dispatch of pigs from the restriction zones to a designated slaughterhouse in Slovenia for immediate slaughter and to holdings in that Member State situated outside the restriction zones should be permitted subject to the condition that the pigs have been submitted with negative results to examinations in accordance with Commission Decision 2002/106/EC of 1 February 2002 approving a Diagnostic Manual establishing diagnostic procedures, sampling methods and criteria for evaluation of the laboratory tests for the confirmation of classical swine fever (5).
(8) No slaughterhouse is available in the restriction zones making it necessary for the Slovenian authorities to designate a slaughterhouse outside those zones for the slaughter, for welfare reasons, of pigs from the restriction zones.
(9) Strict controls are to be put in place by Slovenia for dispatches of pigs from holdings in the restriction zones to a designated slaughterhouse or other holding outside those zones. Due to those strict controls, it is unnecessary to subject meat from those pigs to a treatment pursuant to Directive 2002/99/EC. Furthermore, such meat should not be permitted to enter into intra-Community or international trade.
(10) It is appropriate to provide for specific measures with respect to the marking of fresh pigmeat from the restriction zones in Slovenia and its subsequent use as well as the destination of the processed products. Such measures should not reduce the degree of protection from classical swine fever in the Community and should not impair intra-Community trade or international trade.
(11) Accordingly, it is appropriate in this particular case to provide for a specific alternative identification mark that Slovenia may apply to fresh meat from the restriction zones and which cannot be confused with the identification marks for pigmeat provided for in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (6) or Commission Regulation (EC) No 2076/2005 of 5 December 2005 laying down transitional arrangements for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 (7), and the health mark for fresh pigmeat provided for in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (8).
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '8.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 118/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 April 2007\nconcerning measures taken by Slovenia following outbreaks of classical swine fever in Croatia\n(notified under document number C(2007) 1830)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/314/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Since 3 March 2007, several outbreaks of classical swine fever have occurred in Croatia close to the border with Slovenia.

The application of the relevant provision was postponed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 270/2002(9).
(3) The ban on feeding processed animal protein to certain farmed animals in Decision 2000/766/EC should be extended to the feeding of any animal protein to ruminants, as a matter of coherence and to avoid any risk of BSE transmission. Certain animal proteins, which use is neither considered to pose a risk of BSE nor to hamper controls, should continue to be allowed.
(4) Eggs and egg products are not considered to present a risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, therefore the feeding of eggs and egg products to farmed animals should be allowed.
(5) As regards the feeding of animals other than ruminants, the rules on the production of fishmeal should be clarified in relation to establishments which produce both fish and fishery products for human consumption, and fishmeal for animal feeding.
(6) Therefore, Decisions 2000/766/EC and 2001/9/EC should be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94, as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 68(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 19 January 2012, the Kingdom of Denmark submitted to the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter ‘Agency’) a dossier pursuant to Article 69(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, in order to initiate the restrictions process in accordance with Articles 69 to 73 of that Regulation (hereinafter ‘Annex XV dossier’). In that dossier, it was demonstrated that exposure to chromium VI, when contained in leather articles or leather parts of articles coming into contact with the skin, poses a risk to human health. Chromium VI compounds can induce new cases of sensitisation and elicit allergic response. The dossier demonstrates that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary.
(2) Chromium VI compounds can be formed in leather through the oxidation of chromium III compounds, which are added in some tanning processes to cross-link the collagen subunits in order to increase leather’s dimensional stability, as well as its resistance to mechanical action and heat. According to the Annex XV dossier, the mechanisms of and conditions under which chromium VI is formed are known and most tanneries in the Union have already developed and widely implemented measures in order to control and minimise its formation.
(3) On 28 November 2012 the Committee for Risk Assessment (hereinafter ‘RAC’) adopted by consensus the opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the RAC opinion, the restriction is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks posed by chromium VI compounds in leather, both in terms of effectiveness and practicability. However, in its opinion RAC proposed to modify the restriction by deleting the notion of direct and prolonged contact with the skin, originally included in the Annex XV dossier.
(4) The proposed restriction focuses on the risk of induction of skin sensitisation related to direct or indirect skin contact with leather articles or leather parts of articles containing chromium VI. In already sensitised people, such contacts may also elicit allergic response at lower concentrations than those needed for the induction of sensitisation.
(5) The proposed restriction should cover leather articles and articles containing leather parts used by consumers or workers, that under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use come into contact with the skin.
(6) The EN ISO 17075 standard method is the only internationally recognised analytical method currently available to detect chromium VI in leather, including leather in articles. The determination limit of the EN ISO 17075 standard method is 3 mg/kg (0,0003 % by weight) of chromium VI content in the total dry weight of the leather. Fixing such threshold for the restriction of the placing on the market of leather articles or articles containing leather parts is therefore justified for monitorability and enforceability purposes.
(7) According to the RAC opinion, the threshold of 3 mg/kg (0,0003 % by weight) of chromium VI content in the total dry weight of the leather corresponds to exposures higher than the Lowest-Observed Adverse Effect Level for elicitation. According to the opinion of RAC, that threshold is expected to be 80 % effective in reducing the occurrence of new chromium VI-related allergic dermatitis cases due to chromium VI in leather articles.
(8) The effectiveness of the restriction on the number of cases of chromium allergy can be determined by monitoring cases of chromium VI-related allergic dermatitis. Should the prevalence of the allergy not decrease, or should an analytical method to detect lower content of chromium VI become available and be recognised as reliable, this restriction should be reviewed.
(9) On 6 March 2013 the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (hereinafter ‘SEAC’) adopted by consensus the opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the SEAC opinion, the restriction, as modified by RAC, is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs.
(10) The Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement was consulted during the restrictions process.
(11) On 8 April 2013 the Agency submitted to the Commission the opinions of RAC and SEAC based on which the Commission concluded that an unacceptable risk to human health arose where chromium VI compounds were present in leather articles and articles containing leather parts, coming into contact with the skin, which needs to be addressed on a Union-wide basis. The socioeconomic impacts of this restriction, including the availability of alternatives, have been taken into account.
(12) The restriction on the placing on the market of second-hand articles would impose a disproportionate burden on the consumers re-selling these articles. Furthermore, due to the nature of those transactions, such restriction would be difficult to enforce. Therefore, this restriction should not apply to leather articles or articles containing leather parts which were in end-use in the Union before this Regulation applies.

In that dossier, it was demonstrated that exposure to chromium VI, when contained in leather articles or leather parts of articles coming into contact with the skin, poses a risk to human health. Chromium VI compounds can induce new cases of sensitisation and elicit allergic response. The dossier demonstrates that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary.\n\n((2)) Chromium VI compounds can be formed in leather through the oxidation of chromium III compounds, which are added in some tanning processes to cross-link the collagen subunits in order to increase leather’s dimensional stability, as well as its resistance to mechanical action and heat. According to the Annex XV dossier, the mechanisms of and conditions under which chromium VI is formed are known and most tanneries in the Union have already developed and widely implemented measures in order to control and minimise its formation.\n\n((3)) On 28 November 2012 the Committee for Risk Assessment (hereinafter ‘RAC’) adopted by consensus the opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the RAC opinion, the restriction is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks posed by chromium VI compounds in leather, both in terms of effectiveness and practicability. However, in its opinion RAC proposed to modify the restriction by deleting the notion of direct and prolonged contact with the skin, originally included in the Annex XV dossier.\n\n((4)) The proposed restriction focuses on the risk of induction of skin sensitisation related to direct or indirect skin contact with leather articles or leather parts of articles containing chromium VI. In already sensitised people, such contacts may also elicit allergic response at lower concentrations than those needed for the induction of sensitisation.\n\n((5)) The proposed restriction should cover leather articles and articles containing leather parts used by consumers or workers, that under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use come into contact with the skin.\n\n((6)) The EN ISO 17075 standard method is the only internationally recognised analytical method currently available to detect chromium VI in leather, including leather in articles. The determination limit of the EN ISO 17075 standard method is 3\xa0mg/kg (0,0003\xa0% by weight) of chromium VI content in the total dry weight of the leather. Fixing such threshold for the restriction of the placing on the market of leather articles or articles containing leather parts is therefore justified for monitorability and enforceability purposes.\n\n((7)) According to the RAC opinion, the threshold of 3\xa0mg/kg (0,0003\xa0% by weight) of chromium VI content in the total dry weight of the leather corresponds to exposures higher than the Lowest-Observed Adverse Effect Level for elicitation. According to the opinion of RAC, that threshold is expected to be 80\xa0% effective in reducing the occurrence of new chromium VI-related allergic dermatitis cases due to chromium VI in leather articles.\n\n((8)) The effectiveness of the restriction on the number of cases of chromium allergy can be determined by monitoring cases of chromium VI-related allergic dermatitis. Should the prevalence of the allergy not decrease, or should an analytical method to detect lower content of chromium VI become available and be recognised as reliable, this restriction should be reviewed.\n\n((9)) On 6 March 2013 the Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (hereinafter ‘SEAC’) adopted by consensus the opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the SEAC opinion, the restriction, as modified by RAC, is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs.\n\n((10)) The Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement was consulted during the restrictions process.\n\n((11)) On 8 April 2013 the Agency submitted to the Commission the opinions of RAC and SEAC based on which the Commission concluded that an unacceptable risk to human health arose where chromium VI compounds were present in leather articles and articles containing leather parts, coming into contact with the skin, which needs to be addressed on a Union-wide basis. The socioeconomic impacts of this restriction, including the availability of alternatives, have been taken into account.\n\n((12)) The restriction on the placing on the market of second-hand articles would impose a disproportionate burden on the consumers re-selling these articles. Furthermore, due to the nature of those transactions, such restriction would be difficult to enforce. Therefore, this restriction should not apply to leather articles or articles containing leather parts which were in end-use in the Union before this Regulation applies.\n\n((13)) It is appropriate to provide for a period of 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation for the stakeholders concerned to take measures to comply with this Regulation, including addressing articles that are already in the supply chain, including in stocks.\n\n((14)) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((15)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 May 2015.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nIn Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the following paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 are added to column 2 of entry 47:\n‘5.\nLeather articles coming into contact with the skin shall not be placed on the market where they contain chromium VI in concentrations equal to or greater than 3\xa0mg/kg (0,0003\xa0% by weight) of the total dry weight of the leather.\n6.\nArticles containing leather parts coming into contact with the skin shall not be placed on the market where any of those leather parts contains chromium VI in concentrations equal to or greater than 3\xa0mg/kg (0,0003\xa0% by weight) of the total dry weight of that leather part.\n7.\nParagraphs 5 and 6 shall not apply to the placing on the market of second-hand articles which were in end-use in the Union before 1 May 2015.’'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) Import duties and export refunds still apply to certain sugar products traded between the Community, of the one part, and the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, hereinafter referred to as ""new Member States"", of the other part, and the level of export refunds is appreciably greater than the level of import duties. In view of the accession of these countries to the Community on 1 May 2004, the appreciable gap between the level of import duties and the level of export refunds granted for the products in question may result in speculative trade flows.
(10) To prevent any abuse through the re-import or re-introduction into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund or levy should be set for all the new Member States for the products covered by this Regulation.
(11) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

(2) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 395(2) of the VAT Directive, the Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 4 May 2010 of the request made by Latvia. By letter dated 7 May 2010, the Commission notified Latvia that it had all the information necessary to consider the request.
(3) A special scheme for small enterprises is an option which is already available to Member States under Title XII of the VAT Directive. The measure derogates from Title XII of the VAT Directive only insofar as the taxable person’s annual turnover threshold for the special scheme is higher than that currently allowed for Latvia under Article 287(10) of the VAT Directive, which is EUR 17 200.
(4) A higher threshold for the special scheme may significantly reduce the VAT obligations of the smallest businesses, whilst that special scheme is optional for taxable persons and allows businesses to opt for the normal VAT arrangements.
(5) In its proposal for a Directive simplifying value added tax obligations of 29 October 2004 (2), the Commission included provisions aimed at allowing Member States to set the annual turnover ceiling for the VAT exemption scheme at up to EUR 100 000 or the equivalent in national currency, with the possibility of updating this amount each year. The request submitted by Latvia is in line with this proposal.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals.

","COUNCIL  DECISION
of 6 March 1986
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dead-burned (sintered) natural magnesite originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea
(86/59/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
1. In June 1982 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Greek producers of dead-burned natural magnesite whose collective output constitutes all Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of natural magnesite, dead-burned (sintered), corresponding to NIMEXE code ex 25.19-51, originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea, and began an investigation.
2. The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 3542/82 (3), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of natural magnesite, dead-burned (sintered), with an MgO content varying between 85 and 92 % originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea. Subsequently, the duty was extended for a period of two months by Regulation (EEC) No 991/83 (4).
3. In June 1983 the Commission submitted a proposal to the Council for the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on the imports of the product concerned. The Council did not, however, adopt this proposal and the provisional duty expired on 30 June 1983.
4. Considering that the proceeding with regard to imports of dead-burned natural magnesite was still pending since it had not been terminated by the Council, the Commission continued the proceeding with regard to these imports. The Commission received from the complainants new prima facie evidence of dumping and renewed injury caused by the Chinese imports. A notice concerning the continuation of the investigation with regard to imports from the People's Republic of China and North Korea was published by the Commission (5).
B. Like product
5. The parties concerned expressed strongly conflicting opinions throughout the investigation concerning the comparability of the products originating in the exporting countries, those originating in the market economy third country (for determining normal value) and those originating in the Community. The
experts appointed by the Commission after the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty to make a study on this matter reached contradictory conclusions.
Subsequently, the Commission continued examining this problem mainly by contacting a significant number of users. However, given the findings with regard to injury (see recitals 6 to 8) it is not considered necessary to take a decision on this question.
C. Injury
6. With regard to the allegation of injury caused by the imports of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea, the evidence available to the Commission shows that the imports into the Community, after having increased from approximately 82 500 tonnes in 1981 to almost 112 000 tonnes in 1982, decreased to approximately 73 000 tonnes in 1983 and further to approximately 61 000 tonnes in 1984, corresponding to an increase of 36 % between 1981 and 1982 but to a decrease of 35 % and 16 % respectively in 1983 and 1984.
7. As far as the possible impact of these imports on the Community industry is concerned, the following findings were made:
1. The production of the Community producers increased between 1981 and 1984 from approximately 73 000 tonnes to almost 153 000 tonnes, which corresponds to an increase of 110 %.
2. The utilization of the production capacity of each of the Community producers increased significantly between 1981 and 1984.
3. The sales of the Community producers on the Community market increased from approximately 42 000 tonnes in 1981 to approximately 60 000 tonnes in 1984 corresponding to an increase of 43 %.
4. The market share held by the Community producers increased from 15,4 % in 1981 to 19,4 % in 1984, whereas the market share held by the products concerned originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea decreased from 30,4 % in 1981 to 19,7 % in 1984.
5. The average sales prices of the Community producers on the Community market increased by 27 % between 1981 and 1984.
6. The profitability of two Community producers improved significantly between 1981 and 1984, but that of the third producer did not. However, the financial difficulties of this company, which have existed for many years, were due mainly to a number of factors unrelated to the imports concerned.
7. The number of people employed by the Community producers increased by 20 % between 1981 and 1984.
8. In the light of these findings it is considered that the Community industry is no longer suffering material injury from the imports of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China and North Korea.
D. Dumping
9. In view of the above findings with respect to injury the Commission considered it unnecessary to further investigate the allegation of dumping with regard to the imports concerned since anti-dumping measures may in general only be taken where examination shows that there has been dumping during the period under investigation, that material injury has been caused thereby and that the interests of the Community call for such measures.
10. In these circumstances it is considered appropriate that the proceeding be terminated without the imposition of protective measures.
11. However, as objections to this course of action were raised in the Advisory Committee by one Member State, the proceeding was not terminated by the Commission, but a proposal to that effect was submitted by the Commission to the Council.
12. The complainants were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate this proceeding. Subsequently, the complainants commented in writing and orally upon this information,","{'title': ""86/59/EEC: Council Decision of 6 March 1986 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dead-burned (sintered) natural magnesite originating in the People' s Republic of China and North Korea""}"

of 18 December 2008
rejecting the proposal from the Commission for a Council Regulation implementing Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the use of antimicrobial substances to remove surface contamination from poultry carcasses
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2009/121/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 202 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (1), and in particular Article 3(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission for a Council Regulation implementing Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 as regards the use of antimicrobial substances to remove surface contamination from poultry carcasses,
Having regard to Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators. It provides that food business operators are not to use any substance other than water to remove surface contamination from products of animal origin, unless the use of such substance has been approved in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) A high level of protection of human health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies. Measures adopted by the Community governing food and feed must be based on an appropriate assessment of the possible risks for human and animal health and must, taking into account existing scientific evidence, maintain, or if scientifically justified, increase the level of protection of human and animal health ensured in the Community. High hygiene standards throughout the food production chain and avoidance or prohibition on the use of substances which can potentially mask poor hygiene practices are a key priority in the Community.
(3) In addition, a high level of protection of the environment should be ensured in the pursuit of Community policies, both by acts of environmental policy itself and by the integration of environmental policy requirements into the definition and implementation of other Community policies and activities.
(4) The Commission proposal underlines that several antimicrobial substances such as chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate or peroxyacids that are used to remove surface contamination from poultry carcasses can pose a risk to the aquatic environment, the health of staff working in waste water systems and the operation and performance of sewerage systems and/or waste water treatment plants. The use of antimicrobial substances containing chlorine can also lead to the formation of chloroorganic compounds, several of which are persistent, bioaccumulable or carcinogenic. Phosphorus compounds are also one of the sources of the eutrophication of European regional seas, leading to mass growth algae and other undesirable disturbance of the aquatic environment.
(5) The Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health (SCVPH) issued a report on 30 October 1998 on the ‘benefits and limitations of antimicrobial treatments for poultry carcasses’ and recommended that before any decontamination compound or decontamination technique is authorised for use, it should be fully assessed.
(6) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) adopted a scientific opinion on 14-15 December 2005‘on the evaluation of the efficacy of peroxyacids for use as an antimicrobial substance applied on poultry carcasses’. It concluded that the efficacy of peroxyacids was difficult to assess because the protocols submitted were not always clearly described, and, even if they were, would not be sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of peroxyacids under commercial conditions.
(7) The EFSA adopted a scientific opinion on 6 March 2008‘on the assessment of possible effect of the chlorine dioxide, acidified sodium chlorite, trisodium phosphate and peroxyacids on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance’. The findings led the EFSA to encourage further research on the likelihood of the emergence of susceptibility to these types of substances, and the possibility of their resistance to therapeutic antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents.
(8) The Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) adopted a joint scientific opinion on 18 March 2008 and 2 April 2008 on the environmental impact and effect on the antimicrobial resistance of the four substances used for the removal of microbial surface contamination of poultry carcasses. They stated that ‘there is currently insufficient knowledge on the potential negative effects of using different biocides’ and concluded that there was not enough information available for producing comprehensive quantitative assessments. There were environmental concerns about the possibility to disseminate or select more resistant strains and in relation to the potential residues in the poultry carcasses.
(9) Taking into account scientific information available, it cannot be excluded that the approval of theses substances may lead to an increased antimicrobial resistance in humans.
(10) The emergence of antimicrobial resistance is also a major and permanent concern of international bodies involved in human medicine. The Commission has taken various important legislative initiatives aiming at reducing antimicrobial resistance linked to feed, veterinary treatment of animals and food.
(11) Likewise the Council adopted, at its session of 9 and 10 June 2008, Council conclusions on antimicrobial resistance stressing that antimicrobial resistance is still a growing European and global health problem.
(12) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 19 June 2008, voiced its disapproval of the Commission proposal for the reasons stated above and called on the Council to reject it.
(13) The lack of scientific data in relation to hazards related to the use of these substances leads to the application of the precautionary principle as referred to in Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (3). According to this principle, in specific circumstances where, following an assessment of available information, the possibility of harmful effects on health is identified but scientific uncertainty persists, provisional risk management measures necessary to ensure the high level of health protection chosen in the Community may be adopted, pending further scientific information for a more comprehensive risk assessment.
(14) Data collection by food business operators and research programmes should therefore be encouraged so that both the efficacy of these substances and the development of antimicrobial resistances as well as possible environmental impact could be fully assessed. For this purpose, the EFSA has published a joint AFC/BIOHAZ guidance document (4) on the submission of data for the evaluation of the safety and the efficacy of substances for the removal of microbial surface contamination of foods of animal origin. Pending the collection and evaluation of such data, the Council considers it necessary to await the outcome thereof and, in the meantime, to reject the Commission’s proposal,","{'header': '13.2.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 42/13', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 18 December 2008\nrejecting the proposal from the Commission for a Council Regulation implementing Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the use of antimicrobial substances to remove surface contamination from poultry carcasses\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/121/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators.

(2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2002/18/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), provides for the adoption of a list of active substances of plant protection products to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list is contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), and includes ethofumesate.
(2) For ethofumesate the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. By Regulation (EC) No 933/94, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 491/95(7), Sweden was designated as rapporteur Member State. Sweden submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission on 2 October 1998 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(3) This assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 26 February 2002 in the format of the Commission review report for ethofumesate.
(4) The review did not reveal any open questions or concerns, which would have required a consultation of the Scientific Committee on Plants.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing ethofumesate may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include ethofumesate in Annex I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations of plant protection products containing ethofumesate can be granted in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide that the finalised review report, except for confidential information, is kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties. If the review report has to be updated to take account of technical and scientific developments, the conditions for the inclusion of the substance concerned in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC should also be amended in accordance with that Directive.
(7) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to take the requisite preparatory steps.
(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing ethofumesate, and in particular, to review existing authorisations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC to ensure that the conditions regarding ethofumesate set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided within which a complete dossier for each such plant protection product, satisfying the requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC should be submitted and that product re-evaluated in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) It is therefore necessary to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,

Whereas:
(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in Kazakhstan to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The requirements in the legislation of Kazakhstan on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular, the ""Committee of Forestry, Fishing and Hunting (CFFH) of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment Protection"" is capable of effectively verifying the implementation of the legislation in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from Kazakhstan. In particular those rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) It is also necessary to draw up a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the requirements of Council Directive 92/48/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the minimum hygiene rules applicable to fishery products caught on board of certain vessels in accordance with article 3(1) (a) (I) of Directive 91/493/EEC(3). These lists should be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the CFFH to the Commission. It is therefore the responsibility of the CFFH to ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of Directive 91/493/EEC.

Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries (1), as last amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (2), and in particular Articles 14 and 16 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community  rules referred in Annex A (1) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC (3), as last amended by Commission Decision 94/723/EC (4), and in particular point (c) of Article 10 (2) in conjunction with Chapter 10 of Annex I,
Whereas Commission Decision 82/425/EEC (5), as last amended by Decision 92/453/EEC (6), lays down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification of imports of fresh meat from Czechoslovakia;
Whereas, following the partition of this country, it is necessary to lay down the animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from the Czech Republic and to revoke Decision 82/425/EEC;
Whereas, following a Community veterinary mission, it appears that the animal health situation in the Czech Republic compares favourably with that in Member States particularly as regards diseases transmissible through meat; whereas, however, the Czech  authorities have submitted a plan to control classical swine fever in the districts of Benesov, Ceske Budejovice, Havlickuv Brod, Jihlava, Jindrichuv, Hradec, Pelhrimov, Písek, Tábor, Trebic and Zdár nad Sazavou;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93  (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1164/95   (4), lays down the detailed rules for applying the arrangements for importing bananas into the  Community;
Whereas in August and September 1995 the tropical storms Iris, Luis and Marilyn caused severe  damage to the banana plantations in the Community regions of Martinique and Guadeloupe and in the  ACP States of Saint Vincent, Saint Lucia and Dominica; whereas the effects of these exceptional  circumstances on production in the regions affected will be felt until July 1996 and will greatly  affect imports and supplies to the Community markets during the fourth quarter of 1995; whereas  this is likely to cause an appreciable increase in market prices in certain regions of the  Community;
Whereas Article 16 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 stipulates that where necessary, in particular  to take account of the effects of exceptional circumstances affecting production or import  conditions, the forecast supply balance may be adjusted and, in such a case, the tariff quota is  adapted;
Whereas the adaptation of the tariff quota must permit adequate supplies to the Community market  during the fourth quarter of 1995 and provide compensation to operators who include or directly  represent banana producers who suffered damage and who, in addition, in the absence of appropriate  measures, risk losing their traditional outlets on the Community market on a long-term basis;
Whereas the measures to be taken should have a specific transitional nature, within the meaning of  Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93; whereas, prior to the entry into force of the new common  market organization on 1 July 1993, existing national market organizations, in order to cope with  urgent cases or exceptional circumstances such as the tropical storms cited above, included  provisions ensuring supplies to the market from other suppliers while safeguarding the interests of  operators who are victims of such exceptional events;
Whereas also, under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community negotiated  an agreement which provides for the implementation of a provision for the reallocation of supplies  which is intended to overcome such exceptional circumstances and which will safeguard the interests  of operators in the supplier countries which have suffered such damage; whereas this agreement  applies from 1 January 1995;
Whereas, the Community producer regions and the ACP States which suffer such exceptional  circumstances should be able to benefit from comparable measures; whereas the measures should  include the granting of the right to import in compensation third-country bananas and  non-traditional ACP bananas for the benefit of the operators who directly suffered damage as a  result of the impossibility of supplying the Community market with bananas originating in affected  producer regions; whereas, in addition, provision should be made for the quantities marketed on the  Community market pursuant to this measure to be taken into consideration, in due course, for  determining the reference quantities for the operators concerned for the tariff quotas for future  years; whereas these measures should be to the benefit of the operators who have directly suffered  actual damage, without the possibility of compensation, and as a function of the extent of the  damage;
Whereas the competent authorities in the Member States where the operators concerned are  established are the only authorities capable of determining those who should benefit from the  measure in view of their experience and their knowledge of the actual characteristics of the trade  in question and to assess the damage on the basis of the supporting documentation provided by the  operators;

Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) Taking into account the close historical relationship and progressively closer links between the Parties, as well as their desire to strengthen and widen relations in an ambitious and innovative way, the negotiations on the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Moldova, of the other part (‘the Agreement’), were successfully finalised by the initialling of the Agreement on 29 November 2013.
(3) On 10 March 2014, the Commission proposed to the Council that the Agreement should be signed on behalf of the Union and applied in part on a provisional basis in accordance with Article 464 of the Agreement, pending its conclusion at a later date.
(4) The Agreement covers matters falling under the European Atomic Energy Community competence, namely those listed in point (i) of Article 77 of the Agreement.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products(1), as amended by Directive 93/68/EEC(2), and in particular Article 13(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission is required to select, as between the two procedures under Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC for attesting the conformity of a product, the least onerous possible procedure consistent with safety. This means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria set out in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approval certification body is required.
(2) Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined shall be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications. It is therefore desirable to identify the products referred to in the technical specifications.
(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC. It is therefore necessary to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures shall be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.
(4) The procedure referred to in point (a) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III. The procedure referred to in point (b) of Article 13(3) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of Section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of Section 2 of Annex III.

","Commission Regulation (EC) No 129/2004
of 26 January 2004
fixing the export refunds on pigmeat
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2000(2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1) of that Regulation and prices for these products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in pigmeat that the refund should be fixed as set out below.
(3) In the case of products falling within CN code 0210 19 81, the refund should be limited to an amount which takes account of the qualitative characteristics of each of the products falling within these codes and of the foreseeable trend of production costs on the world market. It is important that the Community should continue to take part in international trade in the case of certain typical Italian products falling within CN code 0210 19 81.
(4) Because of the conditions of competition in certain third countries, which are traditionally importers of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 and 1602, the refund for these products should be fixed so as to take this situation into account. Steps should be taken to ensure that the refund is granted only for the net weight of the edible substances, to the exclusion of the net weight of the bones possibly contained in the said preparations.
(5) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 according to destination.
(6) The refunds should be fixed taking account of the amendments to the refund nomenclature established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 118/2003(4).
(7) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to circulate freely within the Community. Therefore, to be eligible for a refund, products should be required to bear the health mark laid down in Council Directive 64/433/EEC(5), as last amended by Directive 95/23/EC(6), Council Directive 94/65/EC(7) and Council Directive 77/99/EEC(8), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(9).

Whereas:
(1) In April 2002 classical swine fever was confirmed in the feral pig population in North Rhine-Westfalia at the border with Rhineland-Palatinate in Germany.
(2) In accordance with Articles 16 and 20 of Directive 2001/89/EC, the German authorities have submitted plans for the eradication of classical swine fever and for the emergency vaccination of feral pigs in North Rhine-Westfalia.
(3) The German authorities have authorised the use of a live attenuated vaccine against classical swine fever (C strain) to be used for the immunisation of feral pigs by means of oral baits.
(4) The submitted plans have been examined and found to comply with the provisions of Directive 2001/89/EC.
(5) In relation to the classical swine fever situation in the feral pigs in certain areas of Germany, by means of Decisions 1999/335/EC(2) and 2002/161/EC(3), the Commission approved the plans presented by Germany for the eradication of classical swine fever and for the emergency vaccination of feral pigs in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. Decision 2002/161/EC also establishes certain conditions on trade of live pigs and certain pig products from the areas in which the evolution of the disease would probably be influenced by the vaccination.
(6) In accordance with the plans already approved by the Commission and the ones referring to North Rhine-Westfalia vaccination is to be applied in a single area which includes some bordering areas of Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and North Rhine-Westfalia.
(7) For the sake of clarity, it is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2002/161/EC to include under the approval the new plans submitted by Germany referring to North Rhine-Westfalia and to ensure that the same conditions are applied in the whole area within which the evolution of the disease will probably be influenced by the vaccination.

(2) The list in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 includes existing active substance/product-type combinations which were notified in accordance with Article 4(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000 of 7 September 2000 on the first phase of the programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on biocidal products (3), in which a Member State has indicated an interest in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000, or for which a dossier was submitted by 1 March 2006 and accepted as complete.

In some cases, the common understanding shared between the Commission and the competent authorities designated in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 98/8/EC has changed over time.

(4) Persons relying on guidance notes published, or written advice given, by the Commission or by a competent authority designated in accordance with Article 26 of Directive 98/8/EC may therefore have failed to notify the existing active substance/product-type combination in a product placed on the market, or to take over the role of participant, in the objectively justified belief that the product is excluded from the scope of Directive 98/8/EC or that it falls under a different product-type.
(5) Those persons should have the possibility of submitting a dossier for examination under the review programme in such cases, subject, where relevant, to prior notification, in order to avoid the market withdrawal of products for which a justified interpretation as regards its character as a biocidal product or its correct product-type is subsequently contested by Member States or the Commission.
(6) In addition, in cases where, for the same reasons, active substances have not yet been identified as existing, Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 should be updated to correctly reflect all existing active substances.
(7) The situation of persons wishing to notify an active substance/product-type combination on the basis of this Regulation will be similar to that of persons wishing to take over the role of participant in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide for similar procedure and deadlines for informing stakeholders and allowing declarations of intention to the Commission.
(8) Furthermore, it is appropriate to align the deadlines and other requirements for notification with those set out in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1896/2000 for the first notifications of existing active substances to the extent possible, while taking account of the current working methods of the European Chemicals Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).
(9) In cases where no Rapporteur Member State has been designated for the active substance concerned by a notification, and in order to ensure that the substance will be evaluated for approval, confirmation is to be required from the notifier that a competent authority agrees to evaluate the forthcoming application for approval of the active substance.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) In order to ensure a smooth transition from Directive 98/8/EC to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (6), certain parts of this Regulation should apply from the same date as Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.

Whereas technical progress combined with the arrangements for controlling milk production have had the result of developing the use of casein and caseinates in products for which the primary objective of the aid did not intend them; whereas such substitution operations resulted in affecting the stability of the milk market; whereas, while it appears vital, for reasons of competition, to maintain the principle of aid of a sufficient amount, measures to ensure that the granting of the aid may not disturb the balance of the milk market and that casein and caseinates of Community and non-Community origin receive the same treatment must be adopted;
Whereas the characteristics of casein and caseinates and those of cheese show similarities such that the latter products are particulary vulnerable to the abovementioned substitution operations; whereas only the use of casein and caseinates in cheese should accordingly be governed by rules at Community level;
Whereas the sound operation of such arrangements requires, on the part of the Member States, controls ensuring compliance with the obligations laid down: whereas, to that end, provision should be made in particular for controls and the relevant penalties: whereas the penalties must be such as to neutralize at least the economic benefit arising from unauthorized utilization,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2204/90 of 24 July 1990 laying down additional general rules on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products as regards cheese', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe use of casein and caseinates in the manufacture of cheese shall be subject to prior authorization, which shall be granted only if such use is a necessary condition for the manufacture of the products.\n\nAccording to the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/86, the Commission shall determine the conditions under which States shall grant the authorizations and the maximum percentages to be incorporated, on the basis of objective criteria laid down having regard to what is technologically necessary.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n\n(a) 'cheese' means products covered by CN code 0406 and manufactured within Community territory;\n\n(b) 'casein and caseinates' means products covered by CN codes 3501 10 90 and 3501 90 90 and used as such or in the form of a mixture.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

(2) Commission Decision 2009/861/EC (2) provides for certain derogations from the requirements set out in subchapters II and III of Chapter I of Section IX of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 for the milk processing establishments in Bulgaria listed in that Decision. That Decision is to apply from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2013.
(3) According to Decision 2009/861/EC, certain milk-processing establishments listed in Annex II to that Decision may process non-compliant milk without separate production lines.
(4) Bulgaria sent the Commission a revised and updated list of those milk processing establishments on 13 December 2012.
(5) In that revised and updated list, certain establishments currently listed in Annex II to Decision 2009/861/EC have been deleted as they are now authorised to place dairy products on the intra-Union market, since they are considered to comply with the requirements set out in Chapter I of Section IX of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Articles 47, 65, 80 and 81 thereof,
Whereas:
On the basis of complaints and of its own inquiries, the Commission has reason to believe that agreements or concerted practices have been and still are being applied on the common market for steel in such a way as to restrict or distort normal competition within the meaning of Article 65 (1) of the ECSC Treaty. In particular there are grounds for suspecting that there have been and still are agreements or concerted practices between steel-producing undertakings, between steel-distributing undertakings and between steel-producing and distributing undertakings, fixing production and supply quotas, supply channels and prices and sharing out markets.
In order to ascertain the facts, the Director-General for Competition has ordered checks to be made at a number of steel-producing or distributing undertakings pursuant to the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty.
The investigation at Stahlwerke Rรถchling-Burbach GmbH, Vรถlklingen, planned for 7 September 1976, was to have extended to books and papers which were withheld from officials of the Federal Cartel Office during an investigation carried out on 25 August 1976 at the same undertaking, of the grounds that the Federal Cartel Office had no authority in respect of the relevant products. However, Commission investigators discovered during their investigation that the files described by the Federal Cartel Office were no longer kept in the Richardstraรe 12 premises.
The company's management stated that the books and papers had been destroyed on its instructions.
The fact that no written explanation of this behaviour, as required by the Commission and promised by the undertaking, was ever provided, despite a written reminder on 21 September 1976, gives grounds for suspecting that the books and papers in which the Commission is interested are being kept elsewhere. It is accordingly necessary, to require the undertaking by Decision to submit them for inspection.
The undertaking must guarantee that the Commission officials carrying out the investigation will be permitted, during normal office hours, to enter its premises, to inspect the books and papers described in Article 1, to take copies and photocopies as they may require, and to call for immediate verbal and written explanations regarding the matter under investigation.
Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty, the full text of which is annexed hereto, empowers the Commission to impose fines of up to one per cent of annual turnover, or periodic penalty payments of up to five per cent of average daily turnover for each day's delay on undertakings which evade their obligations under decisions taken in pursuance of that Article, or which knowingly furnish false information,","{'title': '77/595/ECSC: Commission Decision of 27 July 1977 concerning checks to be made pursuant to the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty at Stahlwerke Röchling-Burbach GmbH, Völklingen/Saar (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '47', 'title': ""Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty, the full text of which is annexed hereto, empowers the Commission to impose fines of up to one per cent of annual turnover, or periodic penalty payments of up to five per cent of average daily turnover for each day's delay on undertakings which evade their obligations under decisions taken in pursuance of that Article, or which knowingly furnish false information,"", 'text': ""Article 47 of the ECSC Treaty, the full text of which is annexed hereto, empowers the Commission to impose fines of up to one per cent of annual turnover, or periodic penalty payments of up to five per cent of average daily turnover for each day's delay on undertakings which evade their obligations under decisions taken in pursuance of that Article, or which knowingly furnish false information,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:""}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nStahlwerke Röchling-Burbach GmbH, Völklingen, is hereby required to permit checks to be made in its business premises in Völklingen.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 27 June 1984
on a proposed aid by the Netherlands Government in respect of certain investments to be carried out by an oil company at its refinery in Borsele
(Only the Dutch text is authentic)
(84/417/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments,
Whereas:
I
Article 6 of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978 on the promotion and guidance of investment (Wet Investeringsrekening - WIR) (1) introduced an 'additional premium for major schemes' for the benefit of projects where investment exceeds Fl 30 million. The amount of the premium depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question.
When examining the Netherlands Law at the draft stage, in the course of the procedure laid down under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that since the 'additional premium for major schemes' involved no sectoral or regional objectives it therefore constituted a general aid system, and that since the arrangements applied to all investment, without distinction by reference to given undertakings, regions or sectors, they could not qualify under the exceptions laid down in Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). In the absence of such specification, the Commission could not assess the system's effects on trade between Member States and on competition and therefore assess its compatibility with the common market.
In respect of such general aid systems it is now the well-established policy of the Commission to accept them subject to one of two conditions, namely, that the Member Commission State concerned notifies the Commission either of a plan for regional or sectoral application or alternatively, where this is felt not to be possible, of significant individual cases of application.
In line with this approach, and in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission requested prior notification in good time of individual cases of application of the 'additional premium for major schemes', account being taken of the amount of investment concerned.
During discussions with the Netherlands authorities the Commission stated that it would assess each case its own merits in the light of the rules contained in Article 92 et seq., or rules developed during administration of those provisions. The Netherlands Government could not infer that, by requesting regular prior notification the Commission had taken a favourable view of the additional premium system.
The Netherlands Government complied with the Commission's request by including the prior notification of procedure in Articles 6 (7) and 7 (3) of Chapter V of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978.
II
In accordance with this procedure, the Netherlands Government informed the Commission, by telex dated 24 August 1983, of its intention to apply the aid provided for under the abovementioned 'WIR-GPT' aid scheme in favour of investments to be carried out at a refinery in Borsele.
The investment plan foresees the installation of a 'hydrocracker' which can produce a greater proportion of light products to heavy fractions than is possible by the production method hitherto used. The 'hydrocracker' method is rarely used in Europe.
The investment costs are estimated at Fl 1 000 million. The GPT premium proposed is Fl 2 200 000. Realization of the project would result in the creation of approximately 80 jobs.
III
In a series of communications to the Council in recent years, the Commission has drawn attention to the difficulties facing the oil refining industry in the Community as a result of the oil crisis. Briefly described, the difficulties are as follows: the total demand for refined products both of heavy products (heavy fuel oil, etc.) and of light fractions (petrol, etc.)
has declined, but the demand for heavy products has declined more than that for light fractions. At the same time as reducing capacity, the industry has consequently had to invest in plants to raise the relative yield of lighter products. However, the price differential between light distillates and residual fuel oil has, in recent years, generally provided sufficient incentive to companies to carry out the necessary investments.
During recent years, several aid proposals have been notified to the Commission for the same and related purposes. On the grounds that these aids were incompatible with the common market, particularly in view of the situation in the refinery sector, these proposals were subject to negative decisions (1).
The aid initially proposed by the Netherlands Government is likely to affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring the undertaking in question or the production of its goods within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
On 6 October 1983, the Commission initiated the procedure under Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty in respect of the Netherlands proposal.
IV
In their reply to the observations of the Commission when opening the Article 93 (2) procedure, the Netherlands authorities did not challenge the Commission's analysis that, in view of the situation in the refinery sector, the Commission's decisions in similar cases in the past, and the financial capacity of the company concerned, meant that there was no counterpart in Community terms of the proposed aid which would allow the Commission to make a finding of compatibility under Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
However, the Netherlands authorities pointed out that as a result of the construction of the hydrocracker, other investments would be undertaken at the refinery in question in its existing installations which would lead to improved standards of environmental control, particularly in the field of water pollution caused by the existing refinery installations. The cost of this investment was estimated at Fl 5 million. The Netherlands authorities proposed, therefore, the grant of a GPT premium of Fl 750 000 towards these investment costs, justifying the intensity of the aid, 15 %, as being the level normally permitted for aids for environmental purposes in line with the Community framework on such aids.
The Commission considers that this proposal does not meet the basic legal and economic conditions attaching it to GPT grants, i.e. the size of the aided investment falls below the Fl 30 million threshold, it is not associated with job creation, and the intensity of aid 15 % as against 4 % under the GPT system, means that the proposal cannot be considered to be in line with the Commission decision of 21 April 1978 on the GPT/WIR. The Netherlands Government has not produced any evidence that these environmental investments are necessary as a result of the imposition of new norms in the Netherlands which imposes new obligations upon undertakings which would be required if they were to benefit from the policy in the framework of aids for the environment. The project appears to be motivated by a desire to pass at least some GPT grant to the undertaking in question. Its effect is to strengthen the financial position of the undertaking without providing any discernible Community counterpart.
Furthermore, the Commission cannot accept that because it has raised initial objections to an aid proposal, a radically new and different proposal with different objectives and legally and economically incompatible with the basis of the original proposal should be considered without the original proposal having been formally withdrawn or the subject of a negative decision by the Commission. Had the original proposal been withdrawn or subject to a negative decision, an aid proposal based legally and economically on environmental considerations could then have been considered on those bases.
In the framework of the procedure, the Commission has received comments from the Belgian, Danish and French Governments, all expressing the view that the initially proposed aid should not be granted.
V
The terms of the Treaty provide that aid fulfilling the criteria set out in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty shall be incompatible with the common market. The exemptions from this incompatibility set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty specify objectives to be pursued in the Community interest and not that of the individual beneficiary. These exemptions must be strictly
construed in the examination both of regional or sectoral aid schemes and of individual cases of application of general aid systems. In particular, they may be granted only when the Commission can establish that this will contribute to the attainment of the objectives specified in the exemptions, which the recipient firms would not attain by their own actions under normal market conditions alone.
To grant an exemption where there is no compensatory justification would be tantamount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any benefit in terms of the interest of the Community, which at the same time accepting that undue advantages accrue to some Member States.
When applying the principles set out above in its examination of individual cases of application of general aid systems, the Commission must be satisfied that there exists on the part of the particular beneficiary a specific compensatory justification in that the grant of aid is required to promote the attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3). Where such evidence cannot be provided and especially where the aided investment would take place in the absence of aid, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to the attainment, of the objectives specified in the exemptions but serves to increase the financial power of the undertaking in question.
In the case in question, there does not appear to be such a compensatory justification on the part of the undertaking benefiting from the aid.
The Netherlands Government has not been able to provide, nor has the Commission found, any evidence which establishes that the proposed aid meets the conditions justifying one of the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
As regards the exemptions set out in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) in respect of aids designed to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, it is the case that the area in which Borsele is situated continues to enjoy a better socioeconomic situation than that of other regions in the Netherlands; so, therefore, there is no reason to grant the aid in question on the grounds that it will promote or facilitate the development of that area, a purpose, moreover, for which this aid was not intended.
As regards the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), since the market for the production of light distillates does not show the over-capacity characteristics of the rest of the refining sector, this investment would be brought about in any event by normal market forces. There is nothing peculiar to the investment in question to qualify it as a project of common European interest or as one designed to remedy as a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, which merits exemption under Article 92 (3) (b) from the provision laid down in Article 92 (1) on the incompatibility of aids. Finally, as regards the exemption specified in Article 92 (3) (c) of the EEC Treaty in favour of 'aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities', examination of the refinery investment it is proposed to aid shows that the investment can be carried out by the firm using its own resources. In the light of this fact and the general state of the refining industry for light products, it is clear that the aid is not necessary to promote the development of the economic activity in question.
In view of the above, the aid proposal of the Netherlands Government does not meet the conditions necessary to qualify for any of the exemptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '84/417/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 June 1984 on a proposed aid by the Netherlands Government in respect of certain investments to be carried out by an oil company at its refinery in Borsele (Only the Dutch text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '6', 'title': ""Article 6 of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978 on the promotion and guidance of investment (Wet Investeringsrekening - WIR) (1) introduced an 'additional premium for major schemes' for the benefit of projects where investment exceeds Fl 30 million. The amount of the premium depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question."", 'text': ""Article 6 of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978 on the promotion and guidance of investment (Wet Investeringsrekening - WIR) (1) introduced an 'additional premium for major schemes' for the benefit of projects where investment exceeds Fl 30 million. The amount of the premium depends on the number of jobs created and may account for up to 4 % of the investment in question.\n\nWhen examining the Netherlands Law at the draft stage, in the course of the procedure laid down under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that since the 'additional premium for major schemes' involved no sectoral or regional objectives it therefore constituted a general aid system, and that since the arrangements applied to all investment, without distinction by reference to given undertakings, regions or sectors, they could not qualify under the exceptions laid down in Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). In the absence of such specification, the Commission could not assess the system's effects on trade between Member States and on competition and therefore assess its compatibility with the common market.\n\nIn respect of such general aid systems it is now the well-established policy of the Commission to accept them subject to one of two conditions, namely, that the Member Commission State concerned notifies the Commission either of a plan for regional or sectoral application or alternatively, where this is felt not to be possible, of significant individual cases of application.\n\nIn line with this approach, and in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission requested prior notification in good time of individual cases of application of the 'additional premium for major schemes', account being taken of the amount of investment concerned.\n\nDuring discussions with the Netherlands authorities the Commission stated that it would assess each case its own merits in the light of the rules contained in Article 92 et seq., or rules developed during administration of those provisions. The Netherlands Government could not infer that, by requesting regular prior notification the Commission had taken a favourable view of the additional premium system.\n\nThe Netherlands Government complied with the Commission's request by including the prior notification of procedure in Articles 6 (7) and 7 (3) of Chapter V of the Netherlands Law of 29 June 1978.\n\nII\n\nIn accordance with this procedure, the Netherlands Government informed the Commission, by telex dated 24 August 1983, of its intention to apply the aid provided for under the abovementioned 'WIR-GPT' aid scheme in favour of investments to be carried out at a refinery in Borsele.\n\nThe investment plan foresees the installation of a 'hydrocracker' which can produce a greater proportion of light products to heavy fractions than is possible by the production method hitherto used. The 'hydrocracker' method is rarely used in Europe.\n\nThe investment costs are estimated at Fl 1 000 million. The GPT premium proposed is Fl 2 200 000. Realization of the project would result in the creation of approximately 80 jobs.\n\nIII\n\nIn a series of communications to the Council in recent years, the Commission has drawn attention to the difficulties facing the oil refining industry in the Community as a result of the oil crisis. Briefly described, the difficulties are as follows: the total demand for refined products both of heavy products (heavy fuel oil, etc.) and of light fractions (petrol, etc.)\n\nhas declined, but the demand for heavy products has declined more than that for light fractions. At the same time as reducing capacity, the industry has consequently had to invest in plants to raise the relative yield of lighter products.

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 42 and Article 43(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinions of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (4), which was subsequently repealed and integrated into Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (5), has provided a reliable scheme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons of the Union (food distribution scheme) for more than two decades and has positively contributed to the social cohesion of the Union by reducing economic and social disparities.
(2) The objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP) as defined in Article 39(1) of the Treaty include stabilising markets and ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. Over the years, the food distribution scheme has underpinned the fulfilment of both objectives and, by reducing the food insecurity of the most deprived persons in the Union, has proved to be an essential tool contributing to guaranteeing the broad availability of food within the Union while reducing intervention stocks.
(3) The European Parliament, in its resolution of 7 July 2011, called on the Commission and the Council to develop a transitional solution for the remaining years of the current multiannual financial framework, so as to avoid a sharp cutback in food aid as a result of the reduction in funding from EUR 500 million to EUR 113 million and so as to ensure that people who are dependent on food aid do not suffer from food poverty.
(4) The current food distribution scheme relies on the distribution of products from Union intervention stocks, supplemented, on a temporary basis, by purchases on the market. However, successive reforms of the CAP and favourable developments in producer prices have resulted in a progressive reduction in intervention stocks and in the range of products available. The current version of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 only allows market purchases in the case of temporary unavailability of products. In the light of the judgment of the General Court in Case T-576/08 (6), purchases of food on the Union market cannot replace the reduced intervention stocks on a regular basis. In these circumstances, it appears appropriate to end the food distribution scheme. In order to give charity organisations in Member States that are using the current food distribution scheme sufficient time to adapt to the new situation, the food distribution scheme should be amended to provide for a phasing-out period, during which market purchases should become a regular source of supply for the food distribution scheme, in order to complement intervention stocks where suitable intervention stocks are not available. The phasing-out period should end on the completion of the 2013 annual plan.
(5) The Union’s food distribution scheme should apply without prejudice to any national food distribution schemes.
(6) In order to ensure sound budgetary management, it is necessary to lay down a fixed ceiling for Union aid. The food distribution scheme should be added to the list of expenditure in Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (7) to be financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF).
(7) Experience has shown that certain improvements in the management of the food distribution scheme are necessary. The Commission should therefore establish annual plans for the implementation of the food distribution scheme in 2012 and 2013, based on requests by Member States that have been communicated to the Commission and on other information considered to be relevant. Member States should base their requests for food products on national food distribution programmes setting out their objectives and priorities for food distribution to the most deprived persons, which should include nutritional considerations. In this context, it is appropriate that Member States have the option of giving preference to products of Union origin. Finally, in order to secure a proper coverage of costs linked to the implementation of the annual plans, it is necessary for Member States to be given the option to reimburse, within the resources made available through the annual plans, certain costs incurred by designated organisations in relation to administration, transport and storage.
(8) Member States should undertake adequate administrative and physical controls and provide penalties in the case of irregularities in order to ensure that the annual plans are implemented in accordance with the applicable rules.
(9) In order to ensure the continuing operation of the current food distribution scheme, enabling it to be phased out in an efficient manner, this Regulation should apply from 1 January 2012 until the completion of the 2013 annual plan.
(10) Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '16.2.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 44/1', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 121/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 15 February 2012\namending Council Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards distribution of food products to the most deprived persons in the Union', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organisations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community(4), which was subsequently repealed and integrated into Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation)(5), has provided a reliable scheme for the distribution of food products to the most deprived persons of the Union (food distribution scheme) for more than two decades and has positively contributed to the social cohesion of the Union by reducing economic and social disparities.\n\n((2)) The objectives of the common agricultural policy (CAP) as defined in Article 39(1) of the Treaty include stabilising markets and ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes chlorsulfuron, cyromazine, dimethachlor, etofenprox, lufenuron, penconazole, tri-allate and triflusulfuron.
(2) For those active substances the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifiers. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For chlorsulfuron and cyromazine the rapporteur Member State was Greece and all relevant information was submitted on 27 July 2007 and on 31 August 2007. For dimethachlor and penconazole the rapporteur Member State was Germany and all relevant information was submitted on 2 May 2007 and on 19 June 2007 respectively. For etofenprox the rapporteur Member State was Italy and all relevant information was submitted on 15 July 2005. For lufenuron the rapporteur Member State was Portugal and all relevant information was submitted on 20 September 2006. For tri-allate the rapporteur Member State was the United Kingdom and all relevant information was submitted on 6 August 2007. For triflusulfuron the rapporteur Member State was France and all relevant information was submitted on 26 July 2007.
(3) The assessment reports have been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA and presented to the Commission on 26 November 2008 for chlorsulfuron, on 17 September 2008 for cyromazine and for dimethachlor, on 19 December 2008 for etofenprox, on 30 September 2008 for lufenuron and triflusulfuron, on 25 September 2008 for penconazole and on 26 September 2008 for tri-allate in the format of the EFSA Scientific Reports (4). These reports have been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 26 February 2009 in the format of the Commission review reports for chlorsulfuron, cyromazine, dimethachlor, lufenuron, penconazole, tri-allate and triflusulfuron and on 13 March 2009 for etofenprox.
(4) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing chlorsulfuron, cyromazine, dimethachlor, etofenprox, lufenuron, penconazole, tri-allate and triflusulfuron may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review reports. It is therefore appropriate to include these active substances in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(5) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, for lufenuron, dimethachlor and chlorsulfuron the notifiers should be required to submit further information on the chemical specification of the active substances as manufactured. Furthermore, for cyromazine and penconazole it is appropriate to require that the notifiers submit further information on the fate and behaviour of the soil metabolite NOA 435343 (for cyromazine) and U1 (for penconazole) and on the risk to aquatic organisms. Moreover, it is appropriate as regards tri-allate, to require that the notifier submit further information on the primary plant metabolism, the fate and behaviour of the soil metabolite diisopropylamine, the potential for biomagnification in aquatic food chains, the risk to fish-eating mammals and the long-term risk to earthworms. In addition, it is appropriate for the etofenprox to require that the notifier submit further information on the risk to aquatic organisms, including the risk to sediment dwellers, further studies on the endocrine disruption potential in aquatic organisms (fish full life cycle study) and biomagnification. Finally, for dimethachlor, chlorsulfuron and triflusulfuron, the notifiers should be required to submit further information on the toxicological relevance of metabolites in case the substance is classified as carcinogenic category 3.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing chlorsulfuron, cyromazine, dimethachlor, etofenprox, lufenuron, penconazole, tri-allate and triflusulfuron to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a letter registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 1 September 1999, the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands requested authorisation on the basis of Article 27 of the Sixth VAT Directive, to apply a measure derogating from Article 1(A)(1)(a) thereof.
(2) Under Article 27(1) of the Sixth VAT Directive, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from the provisions of the Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.
(3) In accordance with Article 27, the other Member States were informed of the request from the Kingdom of the Netherlands by letter of 28 October 1999.
(4) Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the Sixth VAT Directive states that, in principle, the taxable amount in respect of supplies of goods and services is to be everything which constitutes the consideration which has been or is to be obtained by the supplier for such supplies from the purchaser, the customer or a third party.
(5) By way of derogation from these provisions, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has requested authorisation to include in the taxable amount for transactions involving the working of investment gold the value of the raw material provided by the purchaser and used to make the finished product.
(6) The aim of the derogation is to avoid abuse of the exemption for investment gold and thus to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance; it therefore meets the conditions set out in Article 27 of the Sixth VAT Directive.
(7) The forms of tax evasion or avoidance in question consist mainly of the purchase of VAT-exempt investment gold which is then worked to make jewellery or other goods, with VAT not being charged on the value of the investment gold included in the outgoing transaction.
(8) The derogation will expire on 31 December 2004, so that an assessment can then be made as to whether it is appropriate in the light of changes in the practical application of the special scheme for investment gold established by Directive 98/80/EC(2).
(9) The derogation will have no negative impact on the European Communities' own resources provided from value added tax,","{'title': '2000/256/EC: Council Decision of 20 March 2000 authorising the Kingdom of the Netherlands to apply a measure derogating from Article 11 of the Sixth Directive (77/388/EEC) on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is hereby authorised, by derogation from Article 11(A)(1)(a) of the Sixth VAT Directive, to include in the taxable amount in respect of the supply of goods or services involving the working of non-taxed investment gold the value of the gold contained in the finished product, based on the current market value of the investment gold.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe authorisation granted under Article 1 shall expire on 31 December 2004.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 March 2000.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2475/2000 of 7 November 2000 establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Slovenia(1), and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As an autonomous and transitional measure with effect from 1 July 2000, Regulation (EC) No 2475/2000 adjusts the agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Slovenia.
(2) To allow the application of the arrangements provided for in the above Regulation once this Regulation has been published, the tariff quotas with the serial Nos 09.4083, 09.4084, 09.4090, 09.4111, 09.4112, 09.4115, 09.4116, 09.4117, 09.4118 and 09.4119 should be administered in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1602/2000(3), which codify the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.
(3) Previous tariff quotas for poultry products originating in Slovenia were administered under Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/97 of 20 March 1997 laying down procedures for applying in the poultry sector the Interim Agreement on trade and accompanying measures between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part(4), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1514/97(5), which should be repealed.
(4) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 509/97, in July and October 2000 import licences valid for 150 days were issued for certain products now covered by the quotas introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2475/2000.
To limit the potential trade problems that might temporarily arise from the parallel existence of two different management procedures for some tariff quotas in the poultrymeat sector, i.e. management via the quarterly issue of import licences and management according to the ""first come, first served"" principle in line with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93, import licence holders should be given the possibility of cancellation with release of the security.
(5) A deadline should be laid down for the submission of requests for cancellation, giving traders a reasonable time for submission.
(6) Repayment of import duties on products of groups 80, 90 and 100 listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 509/97 and imported under licences used from 1 July 2000 falls within the scope of Articles 878 to 898 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in eggs (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 806/2003 (2), and in particular Articles 3(2), 8(12) and 15 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 of 22 December 1994 on the adjustments and transitional arrangements required in the agricultural sector in order to implement the agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1340/98 (4), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1371/95 of 16 June of 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of export licences in the egg sector (5) has been substantially amended several times (6). In the interest of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that all exports for which export refunds are requested, with the exception of exports of hatching eggs, shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence with advance fixing of the refund. Therefore specific implementing rules should be laid down for the egg sector which should, in particular, include provisions for the submission of the applications and the information which must appear on the applications and licences, in addition to those contained in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 322/2004 (8).
(3) In order to assure proper administration of the system, the rate of the security for export licences under the said system should be fixed. In view of the risk of speculation inherent in the system in the egg sector, export licences should not be transferable and precise conditions governing access by traders to the said system should be laid down.
(4) Article 8(12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that compliance with the obligations arising from agreements concluded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations regarding the export volume shall be ensured on the basis of the export licences. Therefore a detailed schedule for the lodging of applications and for the issuing of licences should be laid down.
(5) In addition, the decision regarding applications for export licences should be communicated only after a period of consideration. This period would allow the Commission to appreciate the quantities applied for as well as the expenditure involved and, if appropriate, to take specific measures applicable in particular to the applications which are pending. It is in the interest of traders to allow the licence application to be withdrawn after the acceptance coefficient has been fixed.
(6) In the case of applications concerning quantities equal to or less than 25 tonnes, the export licence should be issued immediately if the trader requests it. However, such licences should be restricted to short-term commercial transactions in order to prevent the mechanism provided for in this Regulation from being circumvented.
(7) In order to ensure an exact follow up of the quantities to be exported, a derogation from the rules regarding the tolerances laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 should be laid down.
(8) The Commission should dispose of precise information concerning applications for licences and of the use of licences issued, in order to be able to manage this system. In the interest of efficient administration, the notifications from Member States to the Commission should be made according to a uniform model.
(9) Article 8(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 2771/75 provides that for hatching eggs export refunds may be granted on the basis of an ex post export licence. Therefore implementing rules for such a system should be laid down with the aim of ensuring efficient verification with the obligations arising from the agreements concluded in the framework of the Uruguay Round negotiations are complied with. However, it would appear unnecessary to require the lodging of a security in the case of licences applied for after exportation.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes boric oxide.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, boric oxide has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to Directive 98/8/EC.
(3) The Netherlands was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 7 July 2006 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 20 February 2009, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the examinations made that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric oxide may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include boric oxide in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States authorisations for biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing boric oxide can be granted, modified, or cancelled in accordance with Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) However, unacceptable risks were identified for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors and for treated wood exposed to weathering. Therefore, authorisations for these uses should not be granted unless data have been submitted in order to demonstrate that the products can be used without unacceptable risks to the environment.
(7) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Community level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those risks to the compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Community level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to mitigate the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(8) In the light of the findings of the assessment report, it is appropriate to require that specific risk mitigation measures are applied at product authorisation level to products containing boric oxide and used as wood preservatives. In particular, appropriate measures should be taken to protect the soil and aquatic compartments since unacceptable risks to these compartments have been identified during the evaluation. Products should also be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for professional and industrial users cannot be reduced by other means.
(9) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance boric oxide and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(11) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing boric oxide to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.
(12) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '5.8.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 203/58', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2009/98/EC\nof 4 August 2009\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include boric oxide as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

Products should also be used with appropriate protective equipment if the risk identified for professional and industrial users cannot be reduced by other means.\n\n((9)) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all the Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance boric oxide and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.\n\n((10)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.\n\n((11)) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC, and in particular, to grant, modify or cancel authorisations of biocidal products in product-type 8 containing boric oxide to ensure that they comply with Directive 98/8/EC.\n\n((12)) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 98/8/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall adopt and publish, by 31 August 2010 at the latest, the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.\nThey shall apply those provisions from 1 September 2011.\nWhen Member States adopt those provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication.

of 21 March 1990
determining the maximum amount of the compensation for tuna supplied to the canning industry for the period 1 October to 12 November 1988
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 of 29 December 1981 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2886/89 (2), and in particular Article 17 (6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1196/76 of 17 May 1976 laying down general rules for the granting of compensation to producers of tuna for the canning industry (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas the rules regarding the granting of compensation were modified with effect from 13 November 1988 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3468/88 (4); that this date divides into two periods the last quarter of the 1988 compaign, for which the conditions for the triggering of and, where applicable, granting of compensation must still be analysed;
Whereas, during the period 1 October to 12 November 1988, compensation for tuna supplied to the canning industry was administrated by the abovementioned rules in Regulations (EEC) No 3796/81 and (EEC) No 1196/76 and the maximum amount of this compensation should therefore be determined according to these rules, notwithstanding the fact that these rules have been modified since then;
Whereas compensation is to be granted, if necessary, to Community producers of tuna in respect of tuna for the canning industry; whereas this measure was to compensate Community producers for any disadvantages that may arise under the import arrangements; whereas by virtue of those arrangements a fall in the import prices for tuna could directly threaten the income level of Community producers of this product;
Whereas compensation is granted for the tuna supplied to the canning industry during the three-month period for which prices were recorded, where simultaneously the quarterly average price on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price are less than 90 % of the Community producer price and this fall in prices is caused by the level of prices on the world market in tuna and not by an abnormal increase in the quantities produced;
Whereas, under the arrangements, an analysis should be made of the situation on the Community market in order to determine the maximum amount of the compensation for the period 1 October to 12 November 1988; whereas this analysis has shown that for certain species and presentations of the product considered, during the periods concerned, both the quarterly average market price and the free-at-frontier prices referred to in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1196/76 were less than 90 % of the Community producer price in force, as fixed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3765/87 of 14 December 1987 fixing the Community producer price for tuna intended for the canning industry for the 1988 fishing year (5);
Whereas the information available to the Commission does not suggest that the level of prices on the Community market is caused by an abnormal increase in the quantities of Community production during the period concerned;
Whereas therefore compensation should be granted to Community tuna producers, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2469/86 of 31 July 1986 laying down detailed rules for the granting of compensation to producers of tuna for the canning industry (6), for the period 1 October to 12 November 1988 and the maximum amount of compensation should be fixed for this period for each of the products concerned;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 of 10 February 1975 establishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (3) includes provisions concerning the organisation of the Centre, and in particular its Management Board. Those provisions have been amended several times following each accession of new Member States, when new members had to be added to the Management Board.
(2) An external evaluation of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (hereinafter the Centre) was carried out in 2001. The Commission's response and the Action Plan established by the Management Board on the basis of that response underline the need to adapt the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 in order to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the Centre and of its management structures.
(3) The European Parliament has called upon the Commission to review the composition and working methods of agencies' boards and to put forward appropriate proposals.
(4) A Joint Opinion concerning the future governance and functioning of the Boards of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, of the Centre and of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has been submitted to the Commission by their respective management or administrative Boards.
(5) The tripartite governance of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the Centre and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions by representatives of governments, employers’ organisations and employees’ organisations, is fundamental to the success of those bodies.
(6) The participation of the social partners in the governance of those three Community bodies creates a specificity, which requires them to function according to common rules.
(7) The existence, within the tripartite Board, of the three groups, drawn from government, employers and employees and the designation of a coordinator for the groups of employers and employees have proved to be essential. That arrangement should therefore be formalised and also extended to the government group.
(8) The maintenance of the tripartite representation from each Member State ensures that all major stakeholders are involved and that account is taken of the diversity of systems and approaches which characterise vocational training issues.
(9) It is necessary to anticipate the practical consequences for the Centre of the forthcoming enlargement of the Union. The composition and functioning of its Board should be adjusted to take account of the accession of new Member States.
(10) The Bureau, provided for in the Rules of Procedure of the Management Board, needs to be strengthened in order to ensure continuity in the functioning of the Centre and efficiency in its decision making. The composition of the Bureau should continue to reflect the tripartite structure of the Board.
(11) According to Article 3 of the Treaty, the Community is to aim to eliminate inequalities, and promote equality, between men and women in all its activities. It is therefore appropriate to make provision for encouraging a balanced representation of men and women in the composition of the Governing Board and the Bureau.
(12) Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 should, therefore, be amended accordingly.
(13) The Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, for powers other than those under Article 308,","{'header': '1.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 355/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 2051/2004\nof 25 October 2004\namending Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 establishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/75 of 10 February 1975 establishing a European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training(3)includes provisions concerning the organisation of the Centre, and in particular its Management Board.

Whereas:
(1) Point B.IV, paragraph 1, of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that, for the classification of pig carcases, the lean-meat content has to be assessed by means grading methods authorised by the Commission, which methods may only be statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase. The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance is defined in Article 23(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 of 10 December 2008 laying down detailed rules on the implementation of the Community scales for the classification of beef, pig and sheep carcases and the reporting of prices thereof (2).
(2) Greece has asked the Commission to authorise one method for grading dehided pig carcases. This Member State has presented a detailed description of the uniform manner of dehiding carcases in part one of the protocol provided for in Article 23(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1249/2008 and the results of its dissection trial in part two of that protocol. Both protocols were presented to the other Member States in the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets in 2008, 2009 and 2010.
(3) Examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising this grading method are fulfilled. This grading method should therefore be authorised in Greece.
(4) In accordance with the second paragraph of point B.III of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 Member States may be authorised to provide for a presentation of pig carcases different from the standard presentation defined in the first paragraph of that point, inter alia, where normal commercial practice in their territory differs from that standard presentation.
(5) Greece has specified to the Commission that, in some slaughterhouses in Greece, commercial practice requires also the removal of the skin from the pig carcases, in addition to the removal of the tongue, bristles, hooves, genital organs, flare fat, kidneys and diaphragm as required by that first paragraph. This presentation that differs from the standard presentation should therefore be authorised in Greece.
(6) No modification of the apparatus or grading method may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained. For this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2038/1999 of 13 September 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1527/2000(2), and in particular Article 33(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1443/82 of 8 June 1982 laying down detailed rules for the application of the quota system in the sugar sector(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 392/94(4), provides for the fixing before 1 April and the collection before the following 1 June, of the unit amounts to be paid by sugar producers, isoglucose producers and inulin syrup producers as advance payments of the production levies for the current marketing year.

of 14 December 1999
relating to the granting of a national aid by the Austrian Government to small producers in less-favoured areas by virtue of Annex XV of the 1994 Act of Accession
(1999/849/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the request made by the Government of the Republic of Austria on 20 October 1999,
Whereas:
(1) Article 151(1) of the 1994 Act of Accession provides that the Acts listed in Annex XV shall apply in respect of the new Member States under the conditions laid down in that Annex; Annex XV, Chapter VII, Section ""D. Structures"" paragraph 2(c) provides that by way of derogation from Article 35 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2328/91 of 15 July 1991 on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures(1), ""the Republic of Austria may, subject to authorisation by the Commission, continue to grant, until 31 December 2004, to small producers which were entitled thereto in 1993 by virtue of national legislation, national aid to the extent that the compensatory allowance referred to in Articles 17 to 19 is not sufficient to compensate permanent natural handicaps. The aid granted in total to these producers must not exceed the amounts granted in Austria in the aforementioned year"";
(2) On the basis of this derogation, after the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession the Austrian Government continued to grant national aid adjusted to take account of the Community system of aids established since 1995 and due to remain in force until 2004;
(3) On 26 October 1995, the Austrian Government notified the Commission of the ""Special Directive concerning the granting of a compensatory allowance in less-favoured areas and national aid"", seeking confirmation that the method to be applied by the Austrian authorities for granting the national aid between 1995 and 1998 and for maintaining it until 2004 was valid;
(4) In its Decision of 20 December 1995 (C(95) 3368) relating to national aid, the Commission limited the granting of national aid to holdings the size of which in hectares of usable agricultural area did not exceed the average size for Austria of all agricultural holdings run on a full-time basis, on the one hand, and on a part-time basis, on the other, and could in no circumstances exceed 25 hectares; moreover that Decision is limited to 31 December 1999;
(5) That Decision limits the application of the derogation provided for in Annex XV, by excluding from national compensation approximately 2500 holdings which had an area above the average area of 23 hectares for full-time holdings that received aid and 6 hectares for part-time holdings that received aid out of approximately 124000 holdings in total that received aids;
(6) The Commission's taking the definition of ""small producer"" as a basis for setting a limit on granting this aid means that not all small producers eligible in 1993 under Austrian law, on which the derogation was established, can be compensated as from 1995;
(7) The amount of national aid excluded by the Commission Decision represents less than EUR 1 million, equivalent to 0,5 % of the total Austrian national aid to holdings;
(8) The flat-rate aid granted to holdings since 1995 and planned to continue until 2004 does not exceed the amount of aid granted in Austria in 1993;
(9) The aid in question is unlikely to distort competition within the Community;
(10) Owing to the abovementioned derogation for Austria, all the beneficiaries of the national aid scheme working holdings located in particular in mountainous areas or in regions close to the Eastern border of Austria expected no reduction in the overall compensation paid in 1993, nor that it would be abolished, until 2004;
(11) This being the case, there are exceptional circumstances for considering the intervention planned by the Austrian Government as compatible with the common market, under the conditions provided for in this Decision,","{'title': '1999/849/EC: Council Decision of 14 December 1999 relating to the granting of a national aid by the Austrian Government to small producers in less-favoured areas by virtue of Annex XV of the 1994 Act of Accession', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe scheme for maintaining the aids described in the ""Special Directive concerning the granting of compensatory allowances in less-favoured areas and national aid"" as forwarded to the Commission on 26 October 1995, shall be deemed compatible with the common market until 31 December 2004, providing as it does that if the calculation of the compensatory allowance granted to a holding as from 1995 results in a smaller amount of aid for a holding than it received under this scheme in 1993, the balance shall be made up in the form of national aid.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Austria.\n\nDone at Brussels, 14 December 1999.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nK.

(4) The use of a preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EU) No 107/2010 (2) and chickens reared for laying, ducks for fattening, quails, pheasants, partridges, guinea fowl, pigeons, geese for fattening and ostriches by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 885/2011 (3).
(5) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) in its opinion of 25 April 2012 (4) confirmed its previous conclusions that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) is presumed safe for all animal species, consumers of the products of any animals given the additive and the environment. Although three trials performed by the applicant showed at least one significantly improved parameter in comparison with control groups, the Authority was unable to establish a minimum effective dose as proposed by the applicant, because of conflicting results at different dose levels tested. Two trials showed significant improvements with a dose of 1 × 107CFU/kg but not at 5 × 107CFU/kg feed. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of the preparation of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC PTA-6737) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(1), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(2), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,

(1) An inspection has been carried out on behalf of the Commission in the Republic of Slovenia to verify the conditions under which fishery products are produced, stored and dispatched to the Community.
(2) The provisions of the Slovenian legislation on health inspection and monitoring of fishery products may be considered equivalent to those laid down in Directive 91/493/EEC.
(3) In particular the Veterinary Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (VARS) is capable of effectively verifying the application of the laws in force.
(4) It is appropriate to lay down detailed rules concerning the health certificate which must, under Directive 91/493/EEC, accompany consignments of fishery products imported into the Community from Slovenia. In particular these rules must specify the definition of a model certificate, the minimum requirements regarding the language or languages in which it must be drafted and the status of the person empowered to sign it.
(5) The mark which must be affixed to packages of fishery products should give the name of the third country and the approval/registration number of the establishment, factory vessel, cold store or freezer vessel of origin, except for certain frozen products.
(6) Pursuant to Article 11(4)(c) of Directive 91/493/EEC a list of approved establishments, factory vessels, or cold stores must be drawn up, and a list of freezer vessels equipped in accordance with the points 1 to 7 of Annex II to the Directive 92/48/EEC(3) must also be drawn up. These lists must be drawn up on the basis of a communication from the VARS to the Commission.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down general rules on  the granting of aid for the production of olive oil and of aid to olive oil producer organizations   (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 636/95  (4), and in particular Article 17a (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and  the conversion rates to be applied for the purpose of the common agricultural policy  (5), as last  amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95  (6), and in particular Article 13 (1) thereof,
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the unit amount of the production aid  must be reduced where the actual production for a given marketing year exceeds the maximum  guaranteed quantity fixed for that marketing year; whereas, however, producers whose average  production is less than 500 kilograms of olive oil per marketing year are not affected by that  reduction;
Whereas Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that, in order to determine the unit  amount of the production aid for olive oil which may be paid in advance, the estimated production  for the marketing year concerned should be established; whereas, for the 1993/94 marketing year,  the estimated production aid which may be paid in advance was fixed by Commission Regulation (EC)  No 1187/94  (7);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 17a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84, not more than eight months  after the end of the marketing year the quantity actually produced in respect of which entitlement  to the aid has been recognized must be determined; whereas, to that end in accordance with Article  12a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3061/84  (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 637/95   (9), the Member States concerned must notify the Commission, not later than 31 May following each  marketing year, of the quantity recognized as qualifying for the aid in each Member State; whereas  as a result of those communications the quantity eligible for aid for the 1993/94 marketing year  amounts to 550  000 tonnes for Italy, 2  407 tonnes for France, 323  161 tonnes for Greece, 588   000 tonnes for Spain and 27  486 tonnes for Portugal;
Whereas recognition by the Member States of those quantities as qualifying for the aid implies that  the checks referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 2261/84 and (EEC) No 3061/84 have been carried out;  whereas, however, fixing actual production in accordance with the information on the quantities  recognized as qualifying for Community aid by the Member States does not prejudge the conclusions  that may be drawn from verification of the accuracy of that information under the clearance of  accounts procedure;
Whereas, in view of the quantity actually produced, the unit amount of the production aid provided  for in point (b) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 5 (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC should also  be fixed;
Whereas, the amount in question must be converted into national currencies in accordance with  Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 3498/93  (10) determining the operative events  applicable specifically to the olive oil sector; whereas, as a result, the unit amount of aid must  be fixed taking into account that the operative event is in any case prior to 1 February 1995;
Whereas the amount of production aid in Spain and Portugal is different from that in the other  Member States;
Whereas, in view of the exceptional circumstances which have led to a certain delay in fixing  actual production for the 1993/94 marketing year and in order to ensure that payment of the balance  of the production aid for that marketing year is made under the budget for the 1994/95 financial  year, it is necessary to fix 15 October 1995 as the final date for that payment by derogating from  Article 12b (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3061/84;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Articles 10(3) and 14 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 (3) lays down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.
(3) Those lists may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) An application for authorisation of the use of Advantame as a sweetener in several food categories was submitted in May 2010. The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.
(5) There is a technological need for the use of Advantame as a high-intensity sweetener in various food and tabletop products in order to replace caloric sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose, etc.) thus allowing for a reduction of the caloric content of those foodstuffs. The addition of Advantame as a sweetener to the categories of foods in which high-intensity sweeteners are authorised according to Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 will provide manufacturers with greater flexibility in formulating energy-reduced foods with a similar taste profile as the full-caloric equivalent. The flavour and sweetness qualities of Advantame, coupled with good stability characteristics, mean that Advantame provides an alternative to already approved high-intensity sweeteners, offering consumers and the food industry the option to choose from a wider selection of sweeteners, thus reducing the intake of each individual sweetener.
(6) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) evaluated the safety of Advantame when used as a food additive and expressed its opinion on 31 July 2013 (4). The Authority established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for Advantame of 5 mg/kg bw/day. Conservative estimates of advantame exposure for high level adults and children consumers were below the ADI for the proposed use levels. After considering all the data on stability, degradation products, toxicology and exposure, the Authority concluded that Advantame would not be of safety concern at the proposed uses and use levels as a sweetener.
(7) Therefore, it is appropriate to authorise the use of Advantame as a sweetener in the food categories specified in Annex I to this Regulation and to assign E 969 as an E-number to that food additive.
(8) The specifications for Advantame should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union list of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.
(9) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.

of 22 April 1988
concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB Italia SA)
(Only the Italian text is authentic)
(88/329/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1761/87 (2), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) On 19 July 1984, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2089/84 (3), a definitive anti-dumping duty of 33,89 % was imposed on imports of certain ball bearings manufactured and exported by the Minebea group of companies and originating in Singapore.
(2) In 1985 and 1986 NMB (Italia) SA, Bareggio, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Japanese mother company of the Minebea group, applied, on a regular basis, for the refund of anti-dumping duties amounting in total to Lit . . . (4) paid on imports of the ball bearings during the two years in question. This amount represents part of the anti-dumping duties paid; a refund of the remainder was not requested.
(3) Following submissions by the applicant, additional information on certain costs, prices, commercial conditions and commercial activities of the Minebea group outside Singapore was requested by the Commission on the basis of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of antidumping duties (5) (hereinafter referred to as Notice). The applicant complied with all requests for additional information to the satisfaction of the Commission. Subsequently, the applicant was informed of the preliminary results of this examination and given an opportunity to comment on it. It did so, and the comments were taken into consideration prior to this Decision.
(4) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. No Member State disagreed with this opinion.
B. Argument of the applicant
(5) The applicant has based its claims on the allegation that, for certain sales in the Community, export prices were such that either dumping did not exist or that dumping existed at a level lower than the level of the definitive duty of 33,89 %.
C. Admissibility
(6) The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular that concerning time limits.
D. Merits of the claim
(7) The applications are founded in part; for the rest they are unfounded. According to Article 16 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, anti-dumping duties paid by an importer shall be reimbursed if the importer shows that the duty collected exceeds the actual dumping margin, consideration being given to any application of weighted averages. Pursuant to Article 16 (1) and Part II of the Notice the applicant proved that the duty collected exceeded the actual dumping margin to varying degrees depending on the shipment and the bearing type partly as a result of normal value having decreased. To this extent the applications were founded and the applicant agrees with the Commission's calculation. The amount to be refunded is Lit . . .
(8) The applicant requests, however, the refund of an additional amount. For the determination of this additional amount, the applicant agrees with the Commission that, when calculating the dumping margin for the purpose of establishing whether it was exceeded by the level of duty or not, the export prices have to be constructed in accordance with Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84. Article 2 (8) (b) provides that an export price is
constructed on the basis of the price at which the imported product is first resold to an independent buyer and that allowance shall be made for all costs incurred by the related importer between importation and resale, including customs duties, any anti-dumping duties and other taxes, and for a reasonable profit margin.
The applicant maintains, however, that in constructing the export price, the anti-dumping duty should not be deducted; this would then result in a lower dumping margin for the refund calculation and consequently in a higher amount to be refunded.
The applicant justifies its request by claiming that, as a result of the Commission's position, imports by independent importers are treated differently from imports by related importers.
The Commission has evaluated this argument; it does not find it acceptable.
It is of the opinion that the wording of Article 2 (8) (b) is clear: all duties, including anti-dumping duties have to be deducted from the resale price. The Commission would, therefore, by granting the applicant's request, infringe the express requirement of Article 2 (8) (b) and of Part II 2 (b) and (c) of the Notice. Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 establishes different rules for the determination of the export price in different situations depending on whether the importer is related to the exporter or not. This cannot be considered discriminatory.
The second essential argument by the applicant, who sold on a duty-paid basis, is that a simple increase of its resale price in the Community by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty, would not allow it to qualify for a refund. The Commission stresses that, had the applicant sold on a duty-unpaid basis, a single increase would have been sufficient to allow it to qualify for a refund.
Even where, as in the applicant's situation, the imported product was resold in the Community on a duty-paid basis, only one increase of the resale price by an amount equivalent to the amount of the duty is necessary, provided that the Commission is satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the case under consideration this increase in the price paid by the independent buyer eliminates or reduces the dumping margin and does not represent merely the anti-dumping duty which the importer could pass back to its customer if it obtained a refund. This could be the case, for example, if either the costs incurred between importation and resale by NMB or Minebea's normal value had been reduced since the original investigation period. In addition, other changes in circumstances could require the application of different adjustment or calculation methods which could lead to the same result, i.e. the elimination or reduction of the dumping margin by a single price increase. In the present case there is no evidence that these conditions are met.
For these reasons the applicant's request for the refund of an additional amount has to be rejected,","{'title': '88/329/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 April 1988 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of certain ball bearings originating in Singapore (NMB Italia SA) (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe refund applications submitted by NMB (Italia) SA, Bareggio, for the years 1985 and 1986 are granted for Lit . . . and rejected for the remainder.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amount set out in Article 1 shall be refunded by the authorities of the Republic of Italy.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Italy and NMB (Italia) SA.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardized by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not provide for the compensation system for storage costs to be extended after 1 July 2001. This should therefore be taken into account when fixing the amounts of refunds, in particular with regard to the advance-fixing options.
(7) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1721/2001 of 30 August 2001 fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products appearing in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed in Article 1(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, are fixed as shown in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 September 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 August 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nViviane Reding\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 276, 28.10.2000, p. 3.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 30 August 2001 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain products in the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006, (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (1), and in particular Article 142(e) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 lays down the rules fixing the agricultural area of the new Member States under the single area payment scheme provided for in Article 122 of that Regulation.
(2) In accordance with Article 89 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 (2), the agricultural area for Cyprus is set out in Annex VIII to that Regulation.
(3) By letter of 13 August 2013, Cyprus has informed the Commission that it had reviewed its utilised agricultural area eligible for the single area payment scheme, as referred to in Article 124(1) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009. The revision takes account of the fact that many producers have abandoned their cultivated land in recent years, following exceptional weather conditions in the years 2006-2009 manifested by significant droughts and shortages of water supply for irrigation systems, which had a severe impact on the integrity of the network of dams in Cyprus. Accordingly, the overall area for which the single area payment is claimed has been declining since 2007, which demonstrates the permanent nature of such land abandonment and justifies a revision of the utilised agricultural area. Furthermore, the revision follows from the experience gained in recent years from the verification of the eligibility conditions for the single area payment under the single area payment scheme, which resulted in an update of the identification system for agricultural parcels referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, and which has shown that the utilised agricultural area maintained in good agricultural condition on 30 June 2003 was less than previously estimated. The agricultural area for the single area payment scheme should therefore be reduced to 127 000 ha.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1121/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The amendment proposed by this Regulation should apply to aid applications as from calendar year 2013.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The processing aid for short flax fibre and hemp fibre containing not more than 7,5 % impurities and shives applies until the end of 2007/2008 marketing year. Nevertheless, in view of the favourable trends on the market for this kind of fibre under the current aid scheme and in order to contribute to consolidating innovative products and their market outlets, application of this aid should be extended until the end of the 2008/2009 marketing year.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 of 27 July 2000 on the common organisation of the markets in flax and hemp grown for fibre (1) provided for an increase in the level of processing aid for long flax fibre from the 2008/2009 marketing year onwards. Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 has been replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as of the marketing year 2008/2009. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 were drafted in view of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 as they would have applied as of that marketing year, therefore fixing the aid at the level foreseen. Since the processing aid for short fibres is maintained till the end of the 2008/2009 marketing year, the processing aid for long flax fibre for that additional marketing year should be maintained at the level that has so far been foreseen in Regulation (EC) No 1673/2000 until the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year.
(3) In order to promote the production of high-quality short flax and hemp fibres, the aid is granted to fibres containing a maximum of 7,5 % of impurities and shives. However, the Member States may derogate from this limit and grant processing aid for short flax fibre containing a percentage of impurities and shives of between 7,5 % and 15 % and for hemp fibre containing a percentage of impurities and shives of between 7,5 % and 25 %. Since this possibility is open only till the end of the 2007/2008 marketing year, it is necessary to give the Member States the possibility to derogate from that limit for one more marketing year.
(4) As new market outlets have developed it is required to guarantee a minimum level of raw material supply. So in order to continue to ensure reasonable production levels in each Member State, it is necessary to extend the period in which the national guaranteed quantities apply.
(5) Additional aid has been supporting the continuation of traditional production of flax in certain regions of the Netherlands, Belgium and France. In order to continue enabling gradual adaptation of farm structures to the new market conditions, it is necessary to extend this transitional aid until the end of 2008/2009 marketing year.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included diethofencarb.
(2) In accordance with Article 11e of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/934/EC of 5 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (4) was adopted on the non-inclusion of diethofencarb.
(3) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5).
(4) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/934/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(5) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 21 December 2009. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on diethofencarb to the Commission on 7 September 2010 (6). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 January 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for diethofencarb.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing diethofencarb may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include diethofencarb in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information confirming the potential uptake of the metabolite 6-NO2-DFC in succeeding crops and the risk assessment for non-target arthropod species.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(9) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing diethofencarb to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (7) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.
(11) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(12) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of diethofencarb and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning diethofencarb in the Annex to that Decision.
(13) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.

The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 28 January 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for diethofencarb.\n\n((6)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing diethofencarb may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which have been examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include diethofencarb in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.\n\n((7)) Without prejudice to that conclusion, it is appropriate to obtain further information on certain specific points. Article 6(1) of Directive 91/414/EC provides that inclusion of a substance in Annex I may be subject to conditions. Therefore, it is appropriate to require that the applicant submit further information confirming the potential uptake of the metabolite 6-NO2-DFC in succeeding crops and the risk assessment for non-target arthropod species.\n\n((8)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.\n\n((9)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after inclusion to review existing authorisations of plant protection products containing diethofencarb to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should vary, replace or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorisations, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.\n\n((10)) The experience gained from previous inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(7)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the Directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I.\n\n((11)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.\n\n((12)) Decision 2008/934/EC provides for the non-inclusion of diethofencarb and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning diethofencarb in the Annex to that Decision.\n\n((13)) It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/934/EC accordingly.\n\n((14)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe line concerning diethofencarb in the Annex to Decision 2008/934/EC is deleted.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nMember States shall adopt and publish by 30 November 2011 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(1), and in particular Article 12(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 of 21 June 1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2500/2001(3), a Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development for Hungary was approved by Commission Decision on 18 October 2000, and amended by Commission Decision of 26 November 2002.
(2) The Hungarian Government and the Commission, acting on behalf of the Community, signed on 1 March 2001 the Multiannual Financing Agreement (hereinafter MAFA) laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Special Accession Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development (hereinafter the ""Sapard Programme"").
(3) The competent authority of Hungary has appointed as the Sapard Agency a public institution with legal status, subordinate to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. It will be responsible for implementing some of the measures defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development. The Ministry of Finance, National Fund, has been established for the financial functions which it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme.
(4) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and in accordance with the rules provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for pre-accession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the pre-accession period(4), as amended by Regulation (CE) No 2252/2001(5), the Commission analysed on a case-by-case basis the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance and considers that, for the implementation of the aforementioned measures, Hungary complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(5) In particular, the Sapard Agency has implemented the following key accreditation criteria satisfactorily: written procedures, segregation of duties, pre-project approval and pre-payment checks, payment procedures, accounting procedures, computer security, internal audit, and, where appropriate, public procurement provisions.
(6) On 27 August 2002, the Hungarian authorities provided the revised list of eligible expenditure in conformity with Section B of Article 4(1) of the MAFA, which did not give rise to objections by the Commission.
(7) The Ministry of Finance, National Fund, has implemented the following criteria satisfactorily for the financial functions which it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for Hungary: audit trail, treasury management, receipt of funds, disbursements to the Sapard Agency, computer security and internal audit.
(8) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex-ante approval requirement provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer on the Sapard Agency and on the Ministry of Finance, National Fund, in Hungary, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(9) However, since the verifications carried out by the Commission are based on an operational, but not operating system, it is appropriate to confer the management of the Sapard Programme on the Sapard Agency and on the Ministry of Finance, National Fund, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.
(10) Full conferral of management of the Sapard Programme is only envisaged after further verifications to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily have been carried out and after any recommendations which the Commission may issue, with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the Sapard Agency and on the Ministry of Finance, National Fund, have been implemented.
(11) In order to take account of the requirements of Section A of Article 8(1)(b), of the MAFA, rules for the eligibility for Community cofinance of expenditure pursuant to this Decision should be set out,","{'title': '2002/927/EC: Commission Decision of 26 November 2002 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for pre-accession measures in agriculture and rural development in Hungary in the pre-accession period', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe requirement of ex-ante approval by the Commission of project selection and contracting by Hungary provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 is hereby waived.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nManagement of the Sapard Programme is conferred on a provisional basis to:\n\n(a) the Sapard Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Hungary, for the implementation of the following measures, as defined in the Programme for Agriculture and Rural Development for Hungary: ""Investments in agricultural holdings"", ""Processing and marketing of agricultural and fishery products"", ""Development and improvement of rural infrastructure"" and ""Technical assistance"";\n\n(b) the Ministry of Finance, National Fund, for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard programme for Hungary.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nExpenditure pursuant to this Decision shall be eligible for Community cofinance only if incurred by beneficiaries from the date of adoption of this Decision or, if later, from the date of conclusion of the instrument making them a beneficiary for the project in question, except for feasibility and related studies and for technical assistance, where this date shall be 18 October 2000, provided in all cases it has not been paid by the Sapard Agency prior to the date of adoption of this Decision.\n\nDone at Brussels, 26 November 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 68.\n\n(2) OJ L 161, 26.9.1999, p. 87.\n\n(3) OJ L 342, 27.12.2001, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 253, 7.10.2000, p. 5.\n\n(5) OJ L 304, 21.11.2001, p. 8.'}]}"

(2) Certain provisions and obligations laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75 have not been incorporated in Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Certain appropriate provisions and obligations should therefore be adopted within the framework of a Regulation laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in order to ensure the continuity and smooth running of the common organisation of the market, and in particular marketing standards.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 lays down the basic requirements which eggs for hatching and farmyard poultry chicks must satisfy to be marketed in the Community. For the sake of clarity, new detailed rules for the implementation of those requirements should be laid down. Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1868/77 (3), which lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 2782/75, should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 laid down certain rules for the production and marketing of eggs for hatching and of farmyard poultry chicks. The implementation of these rules requires rules of application aimed, inter alia, at preventing the marketing of eggs removed from the incubator unless they have a special distinguishing mark, at specifying the markings to be made on eggs and the packaging of eggs for hatching and chicks, and providing for communication of the necessary information.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 (3) lays down the animal health conditions for imports of certain birds other than poultry into the Community and the quarantine conditions applicable to such birds after import.

For the sake of clarity, it should also be explicitly stated that birds may only be imported into the Community under Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 if they come from approved breeding establishments.
(3) After imports, the imported birds are to be transported directly to an approved quarantine facility or centre in a Member State, where they must remain until infection with avian influenza or Newcastle disease virus is ruled out.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 318/2007 provides that in case avian influenza or Newcastle disease is suspected in an approved quarantine facility or in a unit of an approved quarantine centre, all birds in the quarantine facility or unit of a quarantine centre are to be killed and destroyed before the suspicion is confirmed by laboratory testing.
(5) However, because these birds suspected to be infected by avian influenza or Newcastle disease are kept in an approved quarantine facility or in a unit of an approved quarantine centre, there is no risk of the disease spreading further.
(6) Therefore, it is appropriate to wait until the suspicion is confirmed to rule out any other cause of disease symptoms before commencing to kill and destroy the birds in the affected premises.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1556/2007
of 20 December 2007
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'header': '21.12.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 337/94', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1556/2007\nof 20 December 2007\nfixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.\n\n((3)) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.\n\n((4)) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Articles 3(3) and 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Outbreaks of Newcastle disease occurred in the United Kingdom in 2005. The emergence of that disease presented a serious risk to the Community’s livestock population.
(2) In order to prevent the spread of the disease and to help eradicate it as quickly as possible, the Community should contribute financially towards the eligible expenditure incurred by the Member State under the emergency measures taken to combat the disease, as provided for in Decision 90/424/EEC.
(3) Commission Decision 2006/602/EC of 6 September 2006 concerning a financial contribution by the Community in the context of emergency measures taken to combat Newcastle disease in the United Kingdom in 2005 (2) granted a financial contribution at the rate of 50 % of the expenditure eligible for Community funding for the implementation of the measures taken to combat this outbreak.
(4) Pursuant to that Decision, the Community financial contribution is to be paid on the basis of the request submitted by the United Kingdom on 11 June 2007 and supporting documents set out in Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3).
(5) In view of those considerations, the total amount of the Community’s financial contribution to the eligible expenditure incurred associated with the eradication of Newcastle disease in the United Kingdom in 2005 should now be fixed.
(6) The results of the inspections carried out by the Commission in compliance with the Community veterinary rules and the conditions for granting Community financial contributions mean the entire amount of the expenditure submitted cannot be recognised as eligible.
(7) The Commission’s observations, method of calculating the eligible expenditure and final conclusions were communicated to the United Kingdom in a letter dated 21 December 2007.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96(1) of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (the Basic Regulation), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1972/2002(2) and in particular Article 11(4),
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(1) The Commission has received an application for a ""new exporter"" review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation. The application was lodged by Indo Pet (Thailand) Ltd. (the applicant), an exporting producer in Thailand (the country concerned).
B. PRODUCT
(2) The product under review is polyethylene terephtalate (PET) with a coefficient of viscosity of 78 ml/g or higher, according to DIN (Deutsche Industrienorm) 53728 originating in Thailand (the product concerned), currently classifiable within CN code 3907 60 20. This CN code is given only for information.
C. EXISTING MEASURES
(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2604/2000(3) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of EUR 83,2 per tonne.
D. GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 October 1998 to 30 September 1999 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures.
(5) The applicant further alleges that they have begun exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the original investigation period.
E. PROCEDURE
(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.
(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ""new exporter"" review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.
(a) Questionnaires
(8) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(9) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
(10) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
F. REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(11) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicants, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G. TIME LIMITS
(12) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
- interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mention in paragraph E(a) of this Regulation or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
H. NON-COOPERATION
(13) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1581/96 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down general rules on the granting of aid for the production of olive oil and of aid to olive oil producer organizations (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 636/95 (4), and in particular Article 17a (3) thereof,
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the unit amount of the production aid must be reduced where the actual production for a given marketing year exceeds the maximum guaranteed quantity fixed for that marketing year; whereas, however, producers whose average production is less than 500 kilograms of olive oil per marketing year are not affected by that reduction;
Whereas Article 17a of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84 provides that, in order to determine the unit amount of the production aid for olive oil which may be paid in advance, the estimated production for the marketing year concerned should be established; whereas, for the 1995/96 marketing year, the estimated production aid which may be paid in advance was fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1888/96 (5);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 17a (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2261/84, not more than eight months after the end of the marketing year the quantity actually produced in respect of which entitlement to the aid has been recognized must be determined; whereas, to that end in accordance with Article 12a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3061/84 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1110/97 (7), the Member States concerned must notify the Commission, not later than 31 May following each marketing year, of the quantity recognized as qualifying for the aid in each Member State; whereas as a result of those communications the quantity eligible for aid for the 1995/96 marketing year amounts 625 000 tonnes for Italy, 2 450 tonnes for France, 445 000 tonnes for Greece, 375 000 tonnes for Spain and 34 000 tonnes for Portugal;
Whereas recognition by the Member States of those quantities as qualifying for the aid implies that the checks referred to in Regulations (EEC) No 2261/84 and (EEC) No 3061/84 have been carried out; whereas, however, fixing actual production in accordance with the information on the quantities recognized as qualifying for Community aid by the Member States does not prejudge the conclusions that may be drawn from verification of the accuracy of that information under the clearance of accounts procedure;
Whereas, in view of the quantity actually produced, the unit amount of the production aid provided for in point (b) of the fifth subparagraph of Article 5 (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC should also be fixed;
Whereas, in view of the exceptional circumstances which have led to a certain delay in fixing actual production for the 1995/96 marketing year and in order to ensure that payment of the balance of the production aid for that marketing year is made under the budget for the 1997 financial year, it is necessary to fix 15 October 1997 as the final date for that payment by derogating from Article 12b (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3061/84;

of 17 June 2008
introducing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 4(1) of the 2005 Act of Accession, Bulgaria and Romania, which acceded to the Union on 1 January 2007, are required from that date to subject nationals of third countries, which are listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (2), to a visa obligation.
(2) According to Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession, the provisions of the Schengen acquis on the conditions and criteria for issuing uniform visas, as well as the provisions on mutual recognition of visas and on the equivalence between residence permits and visas, apply in Bulgaria and Romania only pursuant to a Council decision to that effect. However, they are binding on those Member States from the date of accession.
(3) Bulgaria and Romania are therefore required to issue national visas for entry into or transit through their territory to third country nationals holding a uniform visa or long-stay visa or residence permit issued by a Member State fully implementing the Schengen acquis or similar document issued by Cyprus, a Member State not yet fully implementing it.
(4) The holders of documents issued by those Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis and similar documents issued by Cyprus do not represent any risk for Bulgaria and Romania as they have been subjected to all necessary controls by other Member States. In order to avoid imposing unjustified additional administrative burdens on Bulgaria and Romania, rules similar to the common rules introduced by Decision No 895/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 introducing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories (3) should be introduced for Bulgaria and Romania.
(5) Common rules laid down in this Decision should authorise Bulgaria and Romania to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis and documents listed in the Annex to Decision No 895/2006/EC issued by Cyprus, as equivalent to their national visas and to establish a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on this unilateral equivalence.
(6) Those common rules should also enable Cyprus to recognise visas and residence permits issued by Bulgaria and Romania as equivalent to its national visas for the purpose of transit through its territory.
(7) The simplified regime laid down in this Decision should apply for a transitional period, until the date to be determined by a Council decision as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession in respect of Cyprus and the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession in respect of Bulgaria and Romania, subject to possible transitional provisions in respect of documents issued before that date.
(8) The recognition of a document should be limited to the purpose of transit through the territory of Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania. Participation in the simplified regime should be optional, without imposing on the Member States obligations additional to those laid down by the 2003 Act of Accession and the 2005 Act of Accession.

(10) The entry conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code) (4) have to be fulfilled, with the exception of the condition laid down in Article 5(1)(b) thereof, insofar as this Decision extending the common rules provided for in Decision No 895/2006/EC sets up a regime of unilateral recognition by Bulgaria and Romania of certain documents issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis, similar documents issued by Cyprus as well as unilateral recognition by Cyprus of short-term visas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued by Bulgaria and Romania for the purpose of transit.
(11) Since the objective of this Decision, namely the introduction of a regime of unilateral recognition by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania of certain documents issued by other Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.

 (5), as it is addressed only to Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania which are not yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis.

However, they are binding on those Member States from the date of accession.\n\n((3)) Bulgaria and Romania are therefore required to issue national visas for entry into or transit through their territory to third country nationals holding a uniform visa or long-stay visa or residence permit issued by a Member State fully implementing the Schengenacquisor similar document issued by Cyprus, a Member State not yet fully implementing it.\n\n((4)) The holders of documents issued by those Member States fully implementing the Schengenacquisand similar documents issued by Cyprus do not represent any risk for Bulgaria and Romania as they have been subjected to all necessary controls by other Member States. In order to avoid imposing unjustified additional administrative burdens on Bulgaria and Romania, rules similar to the common rules introduced by Decision No 895/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 introducing a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on the unilateral recognition by the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia of certain documents as equivalent to their national visas for the purposes of transit through their territories(3)should be introduced for Bulgaria and Romania.\n\n((5)) Common rules laid down in this Decision should authorise Bulgaria and Romania to recognise unilaterally certain documents issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengenacquisand documents listed in the Annex to Decision No 895/2006/EC issued by Cyprus, as equivalent to their national visas and to establish a simplified regime for the control of persons at the external borders based on this unilateral equivalence.\n\n((6)) Those common rules should also enable Cyprus to recognise visas and residence permits issued by Bulgaria and Romania as equivalent to its national visas for the purpose of transit through its territory.\n\n((7)) The simplified regime laid down in this Decision should apply for a transitional period, until the date to be determined by a Council decision as referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession in respect of Cyprus and the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession in respect of Bulgaria and Romania, subject to possible transitional provisions in respect of documents issued before that date.\n\n((8)) The recognition of a document should be limited to the purpose of transit through the territory of Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania. Participation in the simplified regime should be optional, without imposing on the Member States obligations additional to those laid down by the 2003 Act of Accession and the 2005 Act of Accession.\n\n((9)) The common rules should apply to uniform visas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengenacquis(which also include, as from 21 December 2007, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia), similar documents issued by Cyprus as well as to short-term visas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued by Bulgaria and Romania.\n\n((10)) The entry conditions laid down in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)(4)have to be fulfilled, with the exception of the condition laid down in Article 5(1)(b) thereof, insofar as this Decision extending the common rules provided for in Decision No 895/2006/EC sets up a regime of unilateral recognition by Bulgaria and Romania of certain documents issued by Member States fully implementing the Schengenacquis, similar documents issued by Cyprus as well as unilateral recognition by Cyprus of short-term visas, long-stay visas and residence permits issued by Bulgaria and Romania for the purpose of transit.\n\n((11)) Since the objective of this Decision, namely the introduction of a regime of unilateral recognition by Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania of certain documents issued by other Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species (1), as last amended by Directive 78/55/EEC (2), and in particular Article 15 (2) and (3) thereof,
Having regard to the application lodged by the French Republic,
Whereas, under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive, seeds or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1976 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, with effect from 31 December 1978, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of the said Directive provides that a Member State may be authorized, upon application, to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the French Republic has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species;
Whereas Commission Decision 79/94/EEC (3) extended the period provided for in the said Article 15 (1) for some of these varieties for the French Republic from 31 December 1978 to 28 February 1979;
Whereas the Commission completed its examination of the French application in respect of these varieties before the expiry of the said period;
Whereas the varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official growing trials in the French Republic ; whereas the results of these trials have led the French Republic to decide that the value for cultivation or use of these varieties is inferior to other comparable varieties accepted in the French Republic;
Whereas, for the varieties Dolcea (cocksfoot), Mocca and Tur (Italian ryegrass), the other Member States have accepted these conclusions ; whereas it is therefore clear that these varieties do not produce results in the French Republic which, with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, of the said Directive);
Whereas, for the variety Rozelle (tall fescue), the results of the trials show that they do not produce results in the French Republic which, with respect to their resistance to harmful organisms without compensation by other superior characteristics (Article 5 (4), second sentence, of the said Directive) correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, of the said Directive).
Whereas, for the varieties Asla Roskilde, Bopa Pajbjerg and Hera Daehnfeldt (cocksfoot), the results of the trials show that they do not produce results in the French Republic which, with respect to their resistance to harmful organisms, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (Article 15 (3) (c), first case, of the said Directive), although in certain circumstances this is compensated by other superior characteristics (Article 5 (4), second sentence, of the said Directive);
Whereas, therefore, the application by the French Republic in respect of seeds of all these varieties should be granted ; whereas, however, the authorization for the three abovementioned cocksfoot varieties may not be applied in all cases ; whereas account should also be taken of the fact that some of the varieties of ryegrass in question are acceptable in the French Republic provided their seed is not intended for the production of fodder plants;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 356/95 (2), and in particular Articles 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 12 January 1998 the Commission received a complaint pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 (herafter the 'Regulation`). The complaint was lodged by Febeltex (Fédération belge du textile - Belgian Textile Federation).
(2) The complainant alleged that the Brazilian non-automatic import licensing and in particular its enforcement through the imposition of compulsory payment terms and compulsory minimum prices are inconsistent with several provisions of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation (hereafter 'the WTO Agreement`) and its annexes. On that basis the complainant asked the Commission to take the necessary actions to convince Brazil to repeal these measures.
(3) The complaint contained sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of a Community examination procedure pursuant to Article 8 of the Regulation. Consequently, such procedure was initiated on 27 February 1998 (3).
(4) Following the initiation of the examination procedure the Commission conducted an in-depth legal and factual investigation into the Brazilian import licensing system as applied to textile products. Based on the findings of this investigation the Commission reached the conclusions which are indicated below.
B. FINDINGS REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF AN OBSTACLE TO TRADE
(5) The investigation established that the Brazilian system is a licensing system within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the WTO Agreement on import licensing procedures (ILP) and should therefore comply with the rules laid down by this Agreement as well as by GATT 1994.
(6) The relevant Brazilian legislation concerning the non-automatic import licensing system is composed of:
- Decreto 660, of 25 September 1992 (which established the Sistema Integrado de Comércio Exterior, Siscomex),
- Portaria Interministerial 291 (Ministry of the Treasury/Ministry of Industry and Trade), of 12 December 1996 (concerning the processing of import operations by means of the Siscomex),
- Portaria Secex 21, of 12 December 1996 (concerning the implementation of import operations by means of the Siscomex, including price control) and
- Comunicados Decex listing the goods subject to non-automatic import licensing, which have been consolidated by Comunicado Decex 37 of 17 December 1997.
However, the Brazilian system is very flexible: new products can be added to the list of those for which a non-automatic import license is required by simple decision of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism.
(7) The Brazilian licensing system is operated via a computerised instrument called Siscomex. The granting of import licenses for imports of textile products originating in the Community is directly linked to a set of compulsory minimum prices and compulsory payment terms. Should these date of an import declaration not be in accordance with those decided and included by the Brazilian authorities in the Siscomex, applications for import licences are not processed and the importer is asked to contact the local agency of the Foreign Trade Department of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (Decex).
(8) The Brazilian legislation introducing this system does not include any indication of the measure being implemented through the licensing procedure. The Commission services have found the existence of internal administrative rules or guidelines concerning compulsory payment terms and minimum import prices that are used in the administration of Brazil's import licensing system. Such rules are not published. As a consequence, governments and traders cannot become acquainted to them. Furthermore, there is no possibility of appeal against such unofficial regulations.
(9) When Siscomex does not process import licence applications which do not comply with the requirements on payment terms and minimum prices, no formal decision is taken on the importer's application. It remains indefinitely pending.
(10) The Brazilian system does not appear to serve to the implementation of any GATT compatible measure, its sole function being the application and administration of import procedures as trade policy tool in order to restrict flows of imports of textile products into Brazil. The examination also demonstrated that this system allows Brazilian authorities to decide in a discretionary and arbitrary manner on the basis of unofficial and not published grounds, the non-granting of import licences. By imposing compulsory payment terms and minimum prices as conditions for the issuance of the licence, Brazil has substantially restricted imports of certain textile products originating in the Community and has discouraged a large number of possible clients for Community producers.
(11) Brazil has not yet notified part of the relevant legislation (Comunicado Decex 37, of 17 December 1997); the remaining part has been notified with a delay of more than one year, only after the initiation by the Commission of the present examination under the Regulation and in this notification some essential information was omitted (for example: the list of products subject to licensing procedures).
(12) Under these circumstances the Commission considers that the complainant's allegations are well founded and that the Brazilian practices constitute an obstacle to trade within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Regulation, as they are contrary to the following provisions:
- Article X.1 and XI.1 of the GATT,
- Article 1(3), 3(2), 3(5)(f) and 5 of the WTO Agreement on import licensing procedures.
(13) The Commission nonetheless considers that reference to the above legal bases does not rule out recourse to any other pertinent provision of the WTO Agreement and of the Agreements annexed to it, which could be of use in procedures before the WTO.
C. FINDINGS REGARDING ADVERSE TRADE EFFECTS
(14) The Commission investigation highlighted the enormous potentiality of the Brazilian market for the highly competitive products exported by Community producers. In this regard, the main findings on the adverse trade effects caused by the challenged practices indicate that Brazil's non-automatic import licensing system represents a significant restriction to access the Brazilian market for several Community textile products.
(15) The investigation covered products contained within Chapters 50 to 63 of the Combined Nomenclature and revealed that the effects of the Brazilian system vary from one sector of products to another. Generally speaking, notwithstanding the great potential of the Brazilian market, Community textile exports to Brazil registered no significant increase between 1996 and 1997, especially when compared to those reported on other similar South American markets.
(16) In particular, the introduction of the non-automatic import licence system and the way it is implemented through the compulsory payment terms and the imposed minimum price has already caused in 1997 (and, in some cases, in 1996) a decrease of exports of certain European Union textile products, such as mattress ticking (CN codes: 5516 23 10; 5210 49 00), webbing (CN code: 5806 32 10), bedspreads (and related products) (CN codes: 6302 32 90), knitted synthethic fabrics for curtains (CN code: 6002 43 11), technical fabrics for casual wear (e.g. lyocell, elastan) (CN code: 5516 13 00) to Brazil.
(17) The challenged Brazilian practices have caused an important loss of competitiveness in the Brazilian market for Community exporters of certain textile products. Such loss of competitiveness has been particularly drastic in those sectors, such as mattress ticking, curtain fabrics or webbing, that are subject to minimum import prices.
(18) The introduction of the contested measures has led in many cases to a significant loss in the number and importance of Brazilian clients as well as in the number and importance of the orders received or confirmed.
(19) The requirement of minimum prices has also led to a substantial reduction in the range of products that may be exported to Brazil. In other words, products whose export price is far too low, in comparison with the compulsory minimum price required, can no longer be exported because it would no longer be competitive at the higher price. Significantly enough, this consequence often takes place in relation to low price products, for which there is higher local competition. Accordingly, the Brazilian importer will turn to buy the Brazilian product, which, if it were not for the imposition of compulsory minimum prices, would be more expensive than the equivalent Community textile product.
(20) A further adverse trade effect caused on Community producers/exporters of textile products is the need to change the technical specification or composition of a product. This change is required by the need to comply with the required minimum prices. A change in the technical specification of the product will in some cases be the only way to obtain a product whose price meets the required minimum one and that it is still economically viable. In this regard, the Commission services have been provided with examples where, in the case of mattress ticking, the percentage of cotton, rayon, polyester, etc. in a product had to be altered, e.g. by using a new raw material (such as rayon) or by using a new raw material which results in a different weight per square metre (such as polypropylene).
(21) The use of Brazil's non-automatic import licensing system as a trade policy tool to control trade flows has resulted, in some textile sectors, in a complete alteration of the market conditions which in some cases has led to an almost closing of the Brazilian market to Community textile exporters. As an example, the minimum import price of USD 20/kg imposed by the Brazilian authorities on imports of jacquard mattress ticking under CN code 5516 23 10 is more than the double of the normal sale price of this product (i.e. to USD 8 to 11/kg). Such an increase of price has caused an important loss of competitiveness in the Brazilian market for Community exporters of this home textile product
(22) Therefore, the Commission concluded that the abovementioned effects do constitute adverse trade effects within the meaning of Article 2(4) of the Regulation.
D. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(23) In the last couple of years, European exporters and producers have lodged three cases against Brazilian practices having restrictive effects on Community exports of different products (steel plates, textiles, and sorbitol). These measures seem to be directed at specific sensitive sectors, in a non-transparent way, and through a very flexible decisional process. For this reason, it is of major importance for the Community to tackle in a comprehensive way the Brazilian system.
(24) Moreover, ensuring that WTO partners fully comply with their obligations is of the utmost importance for the Community, which has committed itself to the same obligations. It is fundamental for the good functioning of a multilateral trade system to consistently tackle all allegedly WTO incompatible practices.
(25) As regards the Febeltex case, given the importance of the textile industry for the Community as a whole and the need to ensure a fair access to third country markets for Community textile products, the Community should immediately challenge the Brazilian non-automatic licensing system, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Agreement on import licensing procedures, GATT 1994 and the WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding.
E. CONCLUSIONS AND MEASURES TO BE TAKEN
(26) Meetings have been held and letters have been exchanged with the relevant Brazilian authorities to discuss this matter further aimed at finding an amicable solution, but the Brazilian authorities did not forward any proposal in view of such solution.
(27) In these circumstances, it appears that the interests of the Community call for initiation of WTO dispute settlement proceeding,","{'title': '1999/234/EC: Commission Decision of 17 March 1999 under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 concerning the Brazilian non-automatic import licensing system and its operation (notified under document number C(1999) 607)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Decision 69/494/EEC of 16 December 1969 on the progressive standardization of agreements concerning commercial relations between Member States and third countries and on the negotiation of Community agreements (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas extension or tacit renewal beyond the end of the transitional period was last authorized in the case of the agreements and protocols listed in the Annex by Decision 86/124/EEC (2);
Whereas the Member States concerned have, with a view to avoiding any disruption of their commercial relations with the third countries concerned based on agreement, requested authorization to extend or renew the abovementioned agreements;
Whereas, however, most of the areas covered by these national agreements are henceforth the subject of Community agreements; whereas, in this situation, there should be authorization for the maintenance of national agreements only for those areas not covered by Community agreements; whereas, in addition, such authorization should not, therefore, adversely affect the obligation incumbent upon the Member States to avoid and, where appropriate, to eliminate any incompatibility between such agreements and the provisions of Community law;
Whereas the provisions of the agreements to be either prolonged or renewed should not furthermore, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas the Member States concerned have declared that the extension or tacit renewal of these agreements would neither constitute an obstacle to the opening of Community negotiations with the third countries concerned and the transfer of the commercial substance of those agreements to Community agreements nor, during the period under consideration, hinder the adoption of the measures necessary to complete the standardization of the import arrangements of the Member States;
Whereas at the conclusion of the consultations provided for in Article 2 of Decision 69/494/EEC it was established, as the aforesaid declarations by the Member States concerned confirm, that the provisions of the agreements to be extended or renewed would not, during the period under consideration, constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the common commercial policy;
Whereas, in these circumstances, the agreements concerned may be either extended or tacitly renewed for a limited period,","{'title': '87/229/EEC: Council Decision of 7 April 1987 authorizing extension or tacit renewal of certain trade agreements concluded between Member States and third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe trade agreements and protocols between Member States and third countries, as listed in the Annex hereto, may be extended or tacitly renewed up to the dates indicated for each of them for those areas not covered by agreements between the Community and the third countries concerned and in so far as their provisions are not contrary to existing common policies.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 7 April 1987.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nPh.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (1) and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 20(11) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/41/EC requires Member States to report to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) their national provisions of prudential nature relevant to the field of occupational pension schemes which are not covered by the reference to national social and labour law in Article 20(1) of that Directive (hereinafter ‘national prudential provisions’). The requirements laid down in this Regulation do not affect Member State competences as provided for in Directive 2003/41/EC with regard to the national social and labour law applicable to institutions for occupational retirement provision.
(2) It is appropriate for EIOPA to make the information reported under this Regulation available on its website to create a centralised source of information at Union level on national prudential provisions.
(3) It is acknowledged that Member States can have provisions applicable to occupational pension schemes in areas such as company law, trust law and insolvency law that extend beyond national prudential provisions. The reporting obligation under this Regulation is not intended to provide an exhaustive list of all the legal and regulatory rules under which occupational pension schemes operate.
(4) In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2003/41/EC, Member States may choose to apply the provisions of Articles 9 to 16 and Articles 18, 19 and 20 of that Directive to the business of occupational retirement provision of insurance undertakings which are covered by Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2). Member States that availed themselves of this option apply a range of national prudential provisions to insurance undertakings that is different from those applicable to occupational pension schemes. For the Member States that follow this option, the reporting obligation should also include information regarding the assets and liablilities referred to in the second paragraph of Article 7 of Directive 2003/41/EC.
(5) In order to ensure uniform reporting, a template should be provided for competent authorities to use when transmitting the requested information to EIOPA. To enable ease of access and comparability of the information transmitted, the template list should correspond to the relevant provisions of Directive 2003/41/EC. The template should also facilitate the reporting of national prudential provisions which are not covered in the list, being of a prudential nature but not directly linked to the transposition of Directive 2003/41/EC.
(6) Given the fact that Union law does not harmonise the structures of institutions for occupational retirement provision, there are numerous structures in which retirement provision is organised across the Member States. Competent authorities should report the names of those institutions and indicate the national prudential provisions applicable to the different structural types, where relevant.
(7) The reporting obligation imposed on competent authorities as regards solvency margins and the guarantee fund as laid down in Articles 17a to 17d of Directive 2003/41/EC, is accommodated in the reporting template through Article 17(2) of that Directive.
(8) In some Member States, national prudential provisions do not apply to the whole territory of the relevant Member State. Therefore, competent authorities should indicate in the template whether their national prudential provisions apply to different territories within their Member State, and the territorial scope of the reported provisions.
(9) Information on national prudential provisions needs to be kept up to date without imposing a disproportionate burden on competent authorities. Therefore, the reporting should be limited to once a year. To increase the consistency of the disclosure of the information, the date to which the reporting refers and the date for the transmission of the information to EIOPA should be fixed. Competent authorities should be able to update that information between reporting dates on a voluntary basis.
(10) To ensure that information on national prudential provisions is available shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation, the first transmission of information should take place within six months from its entry into force.
(11) As specified in Recital 32 of Directive 2010/78/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), the technical standards drafted by EIOPA should be without prejudice to the competences of Member States with regard to prudential requirements on such institutions as provided for in Directive 2003/41/EC.
(12) This Regulation is based on the draft implementing technical standards submitted by EIOPA to the Commission.
(13) EIOPA has conducted open public consultations on the draft implementing technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Occupational Pensions Stakeholder Group established by Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No 1094/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4),","{'header': '17.6.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 177/34', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 643/2014\nof 16 June 2014\nlaying down implementing technical standards with regard to the reporting of national provisions of prudential nature relevant to the field of occupational pension schemes according to Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2003/41/EC requires Member States to report to the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) their national provisions of prudential nature relevant to the field of occupational pension schemes which are not covered by the reference to national social and labour law in Article 20(1) of that Directive (hereinafter ‘national prudential provisions’).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 November 2012 establishing a single European railway area (1) and in particular Article 17(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Recommendation of 7 April 2004 on the use of a common European format for licence documents issued in accordance with Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings (2) recommended the use of the standard format for the licence documents issued by national licensing authorities.
(2) Pursuant to Article 23 of Directive 2012/34/EU licences delivered by national licensing authorities are valid throughout the territory of the Union. The national licensing authorities should inform the European Railway Agency of licences that have been issued, suspended, revoked or amended and the latter should inform the other Member States accordingly. A common template for the licence would facilitate the work of the national licensing authorities and of the European Railway Agency and provide easier access to information on licences by all interested parties, in particular the licensing authorities of other Member States and the infrastructure managers.
(3) All necessary information that confirms that a given railway undertaking has been regularly licensed for a certain type of rail transport services can be contained within a standardised document. The standard template for the licence document would facilitate publication of all relevant information on licences on the website of the European Railway Agency. The standard format could be modified in the future depending on experience of its use and the development of the needs for further information on licences.
(4) The conditions under which the requirements referred to in Article 22 of Directive 2012/34/EU relating to cover for civil liability may be fulfilled may vary between Member States depending on national law. Evidence that the railway undertaking meets these national requirements should be provided for by an annex to the licence document. The standard template for this annex should be used for this purpose. In case the railway undertaking wishes to exercise its activities in two or more Member States, the cover for civil liability for each of these Member States should be mentioned in an additional annex, which should be supplied by the licensing authority in the additional Member State the railway undertaking wishes to operate in.
(5) Licensing authorities may reduce their administrative costs, the level of licensing fees and the time to make a decision on an application for a licence if they swiftly exchange the necessary data with other authorities and other public or private entities.
(6) Due to little movement in the market, no licensing decisions are taken in some Member States for one or more consecutive years. At the same time, high fees may pose an obstacle to market entry of railway undertakings.
(7) Railway undertakings which apply for a new licence should not face less favourable licensing conditions than the railway undertakings already operating in the market.
(8) Unnecessary administrative burden imposed on licensing authorities and undertakings should be reduced by strictly limiting the requirements to the conditions set out in Directive 2012/34/EU.
(9) The licensing authorities have no obligation to request a licensing fee from a railway undertaking. However Member States may decide to impose such a fee for the work undertaken by the licensing authorities on the examination of the application. In such a case the licensing fee should be non-discriminatory, be effectively levied on all the undertakings applying for a licence and be based on the actual workload of the licensing authority. If the licensing fee exceeds EUR 5 000, the licensing authority should set out the number of person hours employed and the expenditure in the payment note for the fee.
(10) In an attempt to create a level playing field between railway undertakings, Directive 2012/34/EU has repealed certain arrangements that are not compatible with enhancing market conditions, whereby railway undertakings have to be insured or have adequate guarantees under market conditions. Licensing authorities should be invited to verify the implementation of the revised conditions in cooperation with other authorities of Member States.
(11) The granting of a licence to a railway undertaking should not be conditional on it holding a safety certificate referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).
(12) New railway undertakings are critical for competition, but they may have practical difficulties to provide a track record on their financial fitness which allows them to establish realistic assumptions for a period of 12 months in the future according to Article 20(1) and (2) of Directive 2012/34/EU. Whilst EU legislators have created the option of simplified proof for certain smaller air carriers according to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4), the procedure for obtaining a licence may take account of these practical difficulties by alleviating the procedure for demonstrating financial fitness for railway undertakings that apply for a licence.
(13) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 62(1) of Directive 2012/34/EU,","{'header': '5.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 29/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/171\nof 4 February 2015\non certain aspects of the procedure of licensing railway undertakings\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Recommendation of 7 April 2004 on the use of a common European format for licence documents issued in accordance with Council Directive 95/18/EC on the licensing of railway undertakings(2)recommended the use of the standard format for the licence documents issued by national licensing authorities.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to Article 23 of Directive 2012/34/EU licences delivered by national licensing authorities are valid throughout the territory of the Union.

Licensing authorities should be invited to verify the implementation of the revised conditions in cooperation with other authorities of Member States.\n\n((11)) The granting of a licence to a railway undertaking should not be conditional on it holding a safety certificate referred to in Article 10 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(3).\n\n((12)) New railway undertakings are critical for competition, but they may have practical difficulties to provide a track record on their financial fitness which allows them to establish realistic assumptions for a period of 12 months in the future according to Article 20(1) and (2) of Directive 2012/34/EU. Whilst EU legislators have created the option of simplified proof for certain smaller air carriers according to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No\xa01008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4), the procedure for obtaining a licence may take account of these practical difficulties by alleviating the procedure for demonstrating financial fitness for railway undertakings that apply for a licence.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established in accordance with Article 62(1) of Directive 2012/34/EU,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation sets out the details for the use of a common template for the licence document.

Whereas:
(1) Hungary has been granted a transitional period of three years with regard to the regime to be applied at the border with Romania for the veterinary checks on live animals.
(2) The measures to ensure that all checks provided for in Directive 91/496/EC are carried out by the Hungarian authorities during this period should be defined.
(3) In view of the continuing negotiations with Romania concerning Romania's accession to the European Union, it is inappropriate to require facilities to be developed at crossing points on the Hungarian-Romanian border to carry out checks on live animals.
(4) Therefore, during the transitional period, provision should be made for inspections to be carried out at inspection sites near the Hungarian-Romanian border that are linked to crossing points. The implementation of the relevant provisions of Directive 91/496/EEC should be adjusted accordingly.
(5) Article 53 of the Act of Accession provides that the new Member States are to be considered as having received notification of this Decision upon accession.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1554/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down the general rules for the system of aid for cotton and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81 (3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1584/96 (4), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1554/95 provides that actual production in each marketing year is to be determined each year, account being taken in particular of the quantities for which aid has been requested; whereas application of this criterion results in actual production, in respect of the 1997/98 marketing year, being established at the level set out hereafter;
Whereas Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 provides that if actual production determined for Greece and Spain exceeds the guaranteed maximum quantity, the guide price is to be reduced in each Member State where production exceeds its guaranteed national quantity; whereas the calculation of the said reduction varies depending on whether the guaranteed national quantity is exceeded both in Spain and Greece or only in one of those Member States; whereas, in the case under consideration, the overrun occurs both in Greece and in Spain; whereas, therefore, under the rules laid down in Article 6(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1554/95, actual production in excess of the guaranteed national quantity is to be calculated in each Member State as a percentage of the guaranteed national quantity of that Member State, and the guide price is to be reduced by a percentage equal to half the percentage excess;
Whereas Article 2(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 provides for an increase in aid, if certain conditions are fulfilled, in each Member State where actual production exceeds its guaranteed national quantity; whereas Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89 of 3 May 1989 laying down rules implementing the system of aid for cotton (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1740/97 (6), sets out the rules for calculating this increase;
Whereas the above conditions are satisfied for the 1997/98 marketing year; whereas the size of the aid increase for each Member State should therefore be calculated; whereas the application of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1201/89 results in those amounts being set for the 1997/98 marketing year as indicated hereafter;

Its activity should be characterized by a multidisciplinary approach based on the large span of its competences. This multidisciplinarity shall be reflected in  the choice of subjects of its institutes, thus ensuring its aptitude to take up new possible challenges.\n\nThis large exposure should not, however, lead to an excessive dispersion of the activities which are undertaken. Without ignoring the expectations of its customers, the Centre and its management must have clear views on the propre scientific-technical  orientations for the JRC and be able to keep a balance in order to ensure that the activities and contracts which are accepted can be executed at any time with the requisite level of competence, qualitatively as well as quantitatively.\n\nParagraphs 5b and 5c of Annex II of the Framework Programme form an integral part of the present JRC multiannual programmes.\n\nThe following presents a summary of the objectives of the programmes based on and taking into account the above elements.\n\nNuclear fission safety\n\nThe objective is to increase scientific and technical knowledge by research on the prevention of accidents and studies on severe accidents, participating in the elaboration of risk assessment techniques and methods by using experimental intallations of  the JRC and by sharing a national research facility.\n\nThe contribution of the JRC will be in the following areas:\n\n- reactor safety,\n\n- safeguards and fissile materials management,\n\n- radioactive waste management, and\n\n- actinides in nuclear fuel cycle safety.\n\nReactor safety\n\nThe JCR activties will concentrate on:\n\n- accident prevention studies;\n\n- severe accident studies, in connection with risk assessment and concentrating on the study of phenomena, by using an existing JRC experimental installation and by sharing a national research facility.\n\nSafeguards and fissile materials management\n\nThe research conducted in networks of national laboratories underpins and aims at the provisions of timely results or new techniques essential for fulfilling Treaty obligations for safeguards, as well as those of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Work will  include nuclear materials measurements, containment and surveillance techniques and the integration of safeguards measures.\n\nRadioactive waste management\n\nJRC objectives are to support the present strategy of the Member States, aiming at the disposal of radioactive waste in geological formations and to carry out research on management strategies which may lead to diminution of waste arising from future  fuel cycle installations. Research conducted in collaboration with national laboratories will benefit from existing and newly constructed experimental facilities.\n\nActinides in nuclear fuel cycle safety\n\nActivities for 1992-1994 will focus on the following subjects:\n\n- safety studies of nuclear fuel behaviour (UO2 and MOX) at extended burn-up, under transient, off-normal and accident conditions,\n\n- basic physico-chemical and solid state studies actinides,\n\n- study of nuclear aerosols,\n\n- mitigation of the minor actinides and other long-lived radioactive nuclides arising in the nuclear fuel cycle,\n\n- plutonium fuel technology (minor activity aimed at maintaining competence in the field).\n\nControlled thermonuclear fusion\n\nThis activity is intended to improve the knowledge base and technology of safety and environmental aspects of future fusion machines for the European fusion programme. The main part of the work will be in support to the next step (NET/ITER). An  important feature of this programme will be the operation of the Ethel laboratory for the experimental study of the safe management of tritium. Other support to the next step will encompass design and development in specific technological areas such as  remote handling of in-vessel components, plasma-facing components tests, data base for structural materials properties and nuclear data.

(93/116/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/91 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3814/92 (2), and in particular Articles 13 (2), 16 (7) and 16a (11) thereof,
Whereas Article 16a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 has fixed the maximum quantity of raw sugar to be imported at a reduced levy from certain ACP States in order to supply the Portuguese refineries for the period 1 January 1993 to 30 June 1993;
Whereas Article 16a (2) of the said Regulation provides in particular that, where, during the specified period, the Community forward estimate for raw sugar shows that the availability of raw sugar is insufficient to ensure adequate supply of Portuguese  refineries, Portugal may be authorized to import from third countries under that period the quantities which it is estimated are lacking; whereas the 1992/93 forward estimate showed that the foreseeable shortfall could be fixed in a first stage by  Commission Decision 92/336/EEC (3) at 74 000 tonnes to be imported from third countries in respect of the period 1 July 1992 to 31 December 1992;
Whereas the actual quantities of raw sugar available; the Community, and in particular production in the French department of Reunion, and quantities available for refining are now known; whereas the remainder of the shortfall in respect of the period 1  January to 30 June 1993 should accordingly be fixed; whereas a risk exists however that all or part of the quantity to be imported from certain ACP States by virtue of Article 16a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, will not be available; whereas  account should accordingly be taken of this risk when fixing the shortfall to be imported at a reduced rate of levy;
Whereas, in order to ensure sound management of the markets in the sector and, in particular, effective control of operations, it is necessary to apply to the sugar concerned the normal rules for performance of the customs formalities for import;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': '93/116/EEC: Commission Decision of 22 February 1993 authorizing Portugal to import from third countries at a reduced levy certain quantities of raw sugar during the period 1 January to 30 June 1993 (Only the Portuguese text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota of 5 000 head of bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the European Economic Community undertook, within the framework of GATT, to open an annual Community tariff quota of 5 000 head at a duty of 4 % for bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas eligibility for such quota is subject to submission of the following documents:
- bulls: a pedigree certificate,
- female animals: a pedigree certificate of registration in the herd book, certifiying purity of breed;
Whereas the abovementioned tariff quota for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 should, therefore, be opened at a duty of 4 %; whereas, however, under the terms of Article 282 of the 1985 Act of Accession, the Portuguese Republic is authorized to postpone, until the beginning of the second stage, the progressive application to imports of preferences granted, unilaterally or by agreement, by the Community to certain third countries; whereas a check should be carried out to ascertain that the imported animals have not been slaughtered within a certain period in accordance with Article 1 (3);
Whereas, it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and continuous access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and the uninterrupted application of the quota duties to all imports of the animals in question until the quota is exhausted; whereas, having regard to the principles defined above, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas possibilities for the use of such mountain breeds are, however, limited by special factors, both geographical and zootechnical; whereas certain Member States do not have regions suitable for breeding this kind of cattle; whereas, however, in view of such special factors, the Community nature of the tariff quota in question should be preserved by marking provision for requirements which may arise in these Member States; whereas, to this end, these Member States may proceed to draw adequate shares from the Community reserve which has been set up; whereas, in order to reflect as closely as possible the actual trend of the market in question, the initial allocation must be made in proportion to the requirements of each of the Member States concerned, calculated in accordance with statistical data concerning imports from third countries during a representative reference period and with economic prospects for the quota period in question;
Whereas, since the animals in question belong to certain specific breeds which are not specified as such in the statistical nomenclatures of the Member States, no data on imports provided by the Member States could be considered to be sufficiently accurate and representative to be used as a basis for the allocation in question; whereas the extent to which Community tariff quotas for those animals in the Community have been exhausted and the estimates made by certain Member States enable the requirements of each of them as regards imports from third countries for the quota period envisaged to be assessed as follows:
Germany 1 500 head
France 120 head
Italy 3 500 head;
whereas the needs of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Spain may, in the absence of precise information, be assessed at 75,25 and 100 head respectively;
Whereas, in order to take into account the possible trend of imports of the aforementioned animals into the said Member States, the quota amount of 5 000 head should be divided into two parts, the first part being allocated among certain Member States, the second forming a reserve intended subsequently to cover the requirements of those Member States when their inital shares are exhausted and requirements which may arise within other Member States; whereas, in order to ensure a certain degree of security for importers in the aforementioned Member States, the first part of the Community quota should be determined at a comparatively high level which unter the present circumstance may be about 86 % of the quota amount; Whereas the initial shares of those Member States may be used up more or less rapidly; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, it is important that that Member State having used up almost the whole of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each of these Member States as and when each of its additional shares is almost entirely used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be available until the end of the quota period; whereas such method of administration calls for close cooperation between Member States and the Commission, which latter must, in particular, be able to observe the extent to which the quota amounts are used and inform Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a specified date within the quota period, a considerable balance of the initial share of one or other of the Member States is left over, it is essential that that State should return a considerable part of such balance to the reserve in order that part of the Community quota should not remain unused in one Member State while it could be used in others;
Whereas it is possible that, during the period of applicability of the said quota, the nomenclature used by the Common Customs Tariff will be replaced by the combined nomenclature based on the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System; whereas this Regulation must take account of the possibility by using the codes of the combined nomenclature within which the said products fall;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any measure concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1707/88 of 13 June 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota of 5 000 head of bulls, cows and heifers, other than those intended for slaughter, of certain Alpine breeds, falling within subheading ex 01.02 A II of the Common Customs Tariff', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 28(2) thereof,
Whereas
(1) Decision 90/424/EEC provides that the Community is to contribute towards improving the efficiency of veterinary inspections by granting financial aid to reference laboratories. Any reference laboratory designated as such, in accordance with Community veterinary legislation may receive Community aid, subject to certain conditions.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 156/2004 of 29 January 2004 on the Community’s financial assistance to the Community reference laboratories pursuant to Article 28 of Decision 90/424/EEC (2) provides that the financial contribution from the Community is to be granted if the approved work programmes are efficiently carried out and that the beneficiaries supply all the necessary information within certain time limits.
(3) The Commission has assessed the work programmes and corresponding budget estimates submitted by the Community reference laboratories for the year 2005.
(4) Accordingly, Community financial aid should be granted to the Community reference laboratories designated to carry out the functions and duties provided for in Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products (3), Council Decision 93/383/EEC of 14 June 1993 on reference laboratories for the monitoring of marine biotoxins (4), Council Decision 1999/313/EC of 29 April 1999 on reference laboratories for monitoring bacteriological and viral contamination of bivalve molluscs (5), Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (6), and Commission Decision 2004/564/EC of 20 July 2004 concerning Community reference laboratories for the epidemiology of zoonoses and for salmonella and national reference laboratories for salmonella (7).
(5) In addition to the financial aid from the Community, further aid should also be granted for the organisation of workshops in areas falling under the responsibility of the Community reference laboratories.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 156/2004 lays down eligibility rules for the workshops organised by the Community reference laboratories. It also limits the financial assistance to a maximum of 30 participants in workshops.

Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 2398/97 the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of cotton-hype bed linen falling within CN codes ex 6302 21 00, ex 6302 22 90, ex 6302 31 10, ex 6302 31 90 and ex 6302 32 90 originating inter alia in India. Sampling was applied to Indian exporting producers and individual duty rates ranging from 2,6 % to 24,7 % were imposed on the companies in the sample, while other cooperating companies not included in the sample were attributed a weighted average duty rate of 11,6 %. A duty rate of 24,7 % was imposed on companies which either did not make themselves known or did not cooperate in the investigation.
(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2398/97 stipulates that where any exporting producer provides sufficient evidence that:
- it did not export to the Community the products described in Article 1(1) of that Regulation during the investigation period (1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996),
- it is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the exporting country which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by that Regulation,
- it has actually exported to the Community the products concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community,
then Article 1(3) of that Regulation can be amended by granting that exporting producer the duty rate applicable to cooperating producers which were not included in the sample, i.e. 11,6 %.
B. NEW EXPORTING PRODUCERS' REQUESTS
(3) Four new Indian exporting producers, after having applied not to be treated differently from the companies which cooperated in the original investigation but were not included in the sample, have provided, on request, evidence showing that they meet the requirements set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2398/97.

Whereas the particularly severe weather conditions of the 1986/87 winter in the Community have serious consequences for the persons most in need suffering from the cold wave; whereas this situation requires the rapid implementation of such operations; whereas the Commuity resources available in the sector should be used as a matter of urgency in order to come to their assistance through recognized charitable organizations;
Whereas for this purpose only the Italian intervention agency holds sugar in stock and this sugar should be made available free of charge to the organizations at their request up to the limit of the quantity in stock and the needs of each Member State;

Whereas the nature of the operation to make available the sugar in question is not a transaction requiring the prices of the sugar to be at the same level and it is not therefore necessary to apply the accession compensatory amounts applicable to trade with Spain and Portugal;
Whereas the operation is not a resale within the meaning of Article 12 (4) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1998/78 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 89/87 (7), and provision should be made that the relevant storage levy should not be payable on the quantities in question and that it should not be taken into account in the calculation referred to in Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3042/78 (9);
